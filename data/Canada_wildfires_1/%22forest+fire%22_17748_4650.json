Nine were from lightning started on Saturday but weren't discovered until Sunday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several crews were out and two of those crews were flown into fires by helicopter &amp; - to the Raft River Valley and to the Tum Tum Lake area. All the fires were brought under control before they spread to any size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">50 YEARS AGO:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Clearwater liquor store had an after-hours visitor. The vandal entered by prying the front door. The store remained closed for the day for stocktaking. It was reported about $1,000 worth of liquor had been stolen.</p><p>45 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Ralph Wallace found a giant puffball near his home recently; the giant fungus weighed five and a half pounds. Wallace claimed its size was very unusual. According to Wallace, puffballs are a form of mushroom and are, in fact, edible. They are a little different in flavour but are enjoyable when fried we understand.</p><p>Wallace said his neighbour Hank Klassen found one which was twice as big but was beginning to deteriorate.</p><p>40 YEARS AGO:</p><p>An interim Clearwater and District Airport Committee was set up with Ed Flegel, Henk Vanderwal, Vern Leweke, Bill Mattenley and Anne Bauer serving until the upcoming election of officers. Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Matheson drove from Vancouver to attend the meeting. Hugh was chairman of the B.C. Aviation Council's map committee, which prepared the air facilities map of B.C., and he also presided over the council's flying club division.</p><p>He explained the structure and funding of the BCAC and its role in community airport development in B.C. The new Clearwater and District airport committee was the second to join the airport owners and operator's division of the BCAC.</p><p>35 YEARS AGO:</p><p>The 1985 Clearwater Strawberry Festival was a great success, said festival organizer Stan Johnston. The festival attracted many hundreds of residents to enjoy sunshine, games, slo-pitch ball and many other attractions including Strawberries and ice cream.</p><p>Twelve teams competed in the slo-pitch tournament. Piva trucking of Barriere won the event, defeating second place Vavenby Vikes 17 to 8 in a well-played final. Third place went to Village from Kamloops.</p><p>30 YEARS AGO:</p><p>B.C. Parks staff burned the cabin at Stillwater on the Murtle River, Parks official Brian Carruthers had informed the Times. The cabin was located several hours of hiking north on a trail which started near the park entrance. It was built by Ted Helset in the late '40s or early '50s for guiding and trapping.</p><p>The main reason for destroying the cabin was that it was becoming an extreme safety hazard due to the dangers of both fire and collapse, said Mr. Carruthers.</p><p>If the building accidentally caught fire with hikers inside, it was likely some would not have made it out, he felt.</p><p>25 YEARS AGO:</p><p>A small herd of renegade cattle that briefly enjoyed he forbidden lushness of the Trophy Mountain Flower Meadows have been banished to other, less delicate, pastures. And a cooperative effort between two government ministries and the rancher involved would ensure only wildlife and outdoors enthusiasts would roam the environmentally sensitive recreation area in the future.</p><p>\"We've reached an amicable solution in a complicated issue in a grey area of legislation,\" said Clearwater Forest District Range Resource Officer Geoff Ellen.</p><p>\"We've come up with a plan that each will cost-share one-third of the total expense for the fences that will solve the problem.\"</p><p>20 YEARS AGO:</p><p>School District 73 wanted a new hardwood floor for the Clearwater Secondary School gymnasium. A request for a replacement for the existing composite floor was near the top priority in the school district's request capital spending for the following year.</p><p>A similar request for the current year was turned down by the Ministry of Education.</p><p>\"It's a health and safety issue,\" said Bert Walker, North Thompson school trustee.</p><p>\"Over the years, the people who insure for injury have identified composite floors over concrete as having significantly higher incidences of knee and leg injury &amp;#x26;#8230; there's no flexibility in them.\"</p><p>15 YEARS AGO:</p><p>A stalking incident was reported to the RCMP after a lady and her adult daughter were at the tourist information centre and observed a suspicious man standing around the counter. When they left, the man followed them in an older baby blue Chevy van.</p><p>They went to the Flour Meadow Bakery and noticed the man was sitting in his van in the parking lot.</p><p>When they left and headed to Spahats Falls they noticed the van following them. At the falls, the man followed them to the viewing platform and attempted to talk to them.</p><p>The ladies immediately left and headed toward Helmcken Falls. When they noticed the van behind them again, they pulled into a nearby business and hid until the van passed, then called the police.</p><p>The van was later located and the man identified. He said he was just out seeing the park.</p><p>Details of the file made it appear to be more than a coincidence and police advise people to be cautious and to report any such incidents immediately.</p><p>10 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Triple Decker Falls canyon north of Clearwater was a scene for high drama recently. Michelle Rushton along with Anna and Ron Mulcahy were out for their afternoon constitutional when they heard dog-like cries coming from deep within the canyon.</p><p>They spotted a Norwegian elkhound that was stranded mid-stream. They quickly placed a call to John Marlow, one of the dog's owners. Very shortly Wells Gray Search and Rescue's rescue team arrived. Certified climb master Les Sakals organized a team consisting of Crystal rogers. Sharon Dhillon, Lee MacKay and Alain Levasseur. Crystal descended and reached the dog, named Smoke. The dog was then harnessed and hauled up the cliff. The dog's owners were quite thankful about the professional rescue.</p><p>5 YEARS AGO:</p><p>It appeared that a quick response by local Forest Service personnel and contractors had contained a small forest fire a few kilometres north of Vavenby. An Initial Attack crew plus a helicopter were dispatched right away.</p><p>The helicopter dropped bucketloads of water to control the fire, plus an air-tanker dropped retardant.</p><p>About six other fires, all of them small, appeared towards the end of the same week. All but two were believed to be lightning caused.</p><p>1 YEAR AGO:</p><p>When Bud Jenkins was taking a cruise down Highway 5 near Blackpool, the last thing on his mind was the potential danger of the cottonwood trees along the sides of the road.</p><p>This would change, however, when one of the trees crashed down on his windshield, sending his to the hospital for surgery.</p><p>\"A whole tree fell on me, it came right across the front of our car and finished it off; it took four hours to get the surgery done on my neck,\" said Jenkins.</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-4023097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B8-4801-F103-30VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Clearwater Times (N.

Nationally, the median price of a single-family detached home increased 23.5% year-over-year to $791,100. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canadians' ability to work remotely, an increased desire for more space with access to nature, and the opportunity to reconnect with family continues to draw buyers to recreational markets. The strength of the demand pipeline is a result of new buyers competing against those who were unable to transact last year, due to low inventory. </p><p>\"For those who can continue to work from home indefinitely, 'home' can be just about anywhere in the country with a decent Wi-Fi connection, including at the base of a mountain,\" said Phil Soper, president and CEO, Royal LePage. \"Despite the easing of travel restrictions and the reopening of some international borders, the global pandemic, which confined millions of people to their own homes in 2020, remains a real concern. As such, many Canadians are choosing to take advantage of local recreational markets over travelling abroad.\"</p><p>All regions surveyed reported having less inventory this year, compared to 2020 and compared to a typical pre-pandemic year. According to Royal LePage recreational market experts, there was no increase in demand from U.S. buyers following the lifting of land border restrictions in any of the regions surveyed, with the exception of Whistler, British Columbia, and Mont-Tremblant, Quebec; two internationally-recognized ski regions. Most regions surveyed reported an increase in demand for luxury properties.2</p><p>\"Canada's recreational housing markets, just like major urban centres and suburbs from coast to coast, are experiencing a chronic supply shortage as growing demand persists, fuelling strong price appreciation. This demand is consistent across all price ranges, including in the luxury recreational market,\" added Soper. </p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Canada's recreational ski regions will increase 9.5 per cent over the next year to $866,300.</p><p>Price data and insights for the Royal LePage 2021 Winter Recreational Property Report were compiled at the start of November, 2021, prior to the flooding in British Columbia.

The median price of a condominium in the region remained stable, decreasing 0.3 per cent year-over-year to $329,000, while sales increased 29.6 per cent during the same period. For those looking for a property slopeside or within walking distance of the base of the mountain, the starting price is typically $1,000,000 for a single-family detached home and $500,000 for a condominium.</p><p>\"During the pandemic, the Mont-Tremblant region welcomed many new households looking for a secondary or primary residence,\" said Louis Bernier, manager and real estate broker, Mont-Tremblant Real Estate, a division of Royal LePage. \"The region attracted not only buyers from within the province; we are also seeing a significant increase in demand from the United States as well. Affordability, its multitude of lakes and the variety of year-round activities available, not to mention the fact that Mont-Tremblant is a world class resort in North America, are just some of the reasons the area has garnered international attention.\"</p><p>Bernier added that demand for luxury homes in Mont-Tremblant has risen since the onset of the pandemic.</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Mont-Tremblant will increase 8.0 per cent over the next year.</p><p>Mont Saint-Sauveur (Saint-Sauveur, Morin-Heights, Piedmont)</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, the median price of a single-family detached home near Mont Saint-Sauveur increased 32.4 per cent year-over-year to $470,000, while sales decreased 16.6 per cent during the same period. The median price of a condominium in the region increased 26.4 per cent year-over-year to $312,300, while sales remained stable, decreasing 0.8 per cent during the same period. For those looking for a property slopeside or within walking distance of the base of the mountain, the starting price is typically $500,000 for a single-family detached home and $300,000 for a condominium.</p><p>The ability to continue working remotely and an increase in demand for luxury real estate are among the driving forces of price growth in the area, according to Royal LePage experts.</p><p>\"We've seen a strong migration of buyers from the Greater Montreal Area in search of a peaceful and spacious place to work since the onset of the pandemic,\" said \u00c9ric L\u00e9ger, real estate broker, Royal LePage Humania. \"As proximity to the workplace is no longer a priority, the Laurentians quickly became a top choice for buyers.\"</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Mont Saint-Sauveur will increase 7.5 per cent over the next year.</p><p>Mont Bromont, Sutton and Orford</p><p>Much like other regions, single-family detached homes in Estrie's recreational markets have seen significant price appreciation. Since the beginning of the year, the median price of a single-family detached home in Bromont, Sutton and Orford increased 58.7 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 30.2 per cent year-over-year to $607,000, $452,500 and $410,000, respectively. In terms of sales, single-family detached homes in Bromont, Sutton and Orford posted a decline of 36.7 per cent, 25.8 per cent and 10.0 per cent, respectively during the same period. Meanwhile, the median price of a condominium rose 41.1 per cent to $381,000 in Bromont and 15.2 per cent to $230,000 in Orford, while sales decreased 33.9 per cent and 32.2 per cent, respectively. For those looking for a property slopeside or within walking distance of the base of the mountain, the starting price is typically between $400,000 and $450,000 for a single-family detached home, and between $140,000 and $250,000 for a condominium, across the regions surveyed.</p><p>\"Real estate demand around Estrie's popular ski mountains has been strong since the start of the year, with buyers coming in droves from Montreal's south shore,\" said Christian Longpr\u00e9, co-owner and real estate broker, Royal LePage Au Sommet. \"We anticipate a modest increase in supply between now and the spring, which could slow price appreciation in the region.\"</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home will increase by 6.0 per cent in Bromont, 3.0 per cent, in Sutton and 5.0 per cent over the next year. </p><p>Stoneham and Lac-Beauport(Stoneham-et-Tewkesbury, Lac Delage, St-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, Lac-Beauport)</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, the median price of a single-family detached home in the Stoneham and Lac-Beauport areas increased 17.1 per cent year-over-year to $410,000, while sales decreased 19.7 per cent during the same period. For those looking for a property slopeside or within walking distance of the base of the mountain, the starting price is typically $700,000 for a single-family detached home and $250,000 for a condominium.</p><p>\"Properties in the region around the $400,000 mark are virtually non-existent as demand in the mid-range continues to be strong,\" said Marc Bonenfant, real estate broker, Royal LePage Inter-Qu\u00e9bec. \"As a result, many properties are being sold at a significantly higher price than the valuations of financial institutions. The upcoming interest rate increases are expected to slow price appreciation in the second half of 2022, resulting in some much-needed supply.\"</p><p>Bonenfant added that price appreciation in 2022 is expected to be driven by the high-end segment of the market, where room for growth remains. </p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in the Stoneham and Lac-Beauport region will increase 3.5 per cent over the next year.</p><p>Data chart - Royal LePage 2021 Winter Recreational Property Report: rlp.ca/table_2021winterrecreationalreport</p><p>Ontario</p><p>Southern Georgian Bay (Collingwood/Meaford/Thornbury)</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the median price of a single-family detached home in Southern Georgian Bay's recreational property market increased 29.5 per cent year-over-year to $725,000, while the median price of a condominium increased 51.4 per cent to $651,000. However, for those looking to buy a house or condominium slopeside or at mountain base, starting prices are typically $1,500,000 and $900,000, respectively. Total sales were up just two per cent in the region year-over-year, as a result of extremely low inventory.</p><p>\"In addition to its proximity to the ski hills of Blue Mountain, the region is a great place to live and work, all year round,\" said Desmond von Teichman, broker, Royal LePage Locations North. \"Prices have been rising at a historic pace for the last several years, as demand continues to increase across all property types. Luxury recreational properties have been in particularly high demand, compared to the pre-pandemic market.\"</p><p>While Blue Mountain remains a significant draw to the region, properties located in Southern Georgian Bay are also in close proximity to a number of private ski clubs, including Craigleith, Alpine and Osler Bluffs.</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Southern Georgian Bay will increase 15.0 per cent over the next year, and expects even greater price appreciation in the condominium segment, popular among city dwellers who enjoy skiing on the weekends.</p><p>Data chart - Royal LePage 2021 Winter Recreational Property Report: rlp.ca/table_2021winterrecreationalreport</p><p>Alberta</p><p>Canmore</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the median price of a single-family detached home in Canmore's recreational property market increased 25.2 per cent year-over-year to $1,234,000, while the median price of an apartment/condominium increased 6.0 per cent to $585,000. However, for those looking to buy a house or condominium slopeside or at mountain base, starting prices are typically $725,000 and $595,000, respectively. Total sales were up 67 per cent in the region year-over-year. </p><p>\"Since the first lockdown was lifted in May of 2020, Canmore has seen home sales volumes jump to record highs. An increasing number of buyers are looking for properties that can be used for short-term and long-term rental,\" said Brad Hawker, sales representative, Royal LePage Solutions. \"This level of activity is unsustainable, however, as the current low inventory will not be able to keep up with growing demand. This imbalance continues to put upward pressure on prices.\"</p><p>Hawker added that demand is driven by retirees looking to relocate to a dynamic community like Canmore where they can be close to Banff National Park, as well as remote workers who are seeking a quieter lifestyle with access to nature and outdoor activities.</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Canmore will rise 10.0 per cent over the next year, led by increased activity in the single-family detached home segment.</p><p>Data chart - Royal LePage 2021 Winter Recreational Property Report: rlp.ca/table_2021winterrecreationalreport</p><p>British Columbia</p><p>Whistler </p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the median price of a single-family detached home in Whistler's recreational property market increased 12.2 per cent year-over-year to $2,200,000, while the median price of a condominium increased 17.7 per cent to $798,000. However, for those looking to buy a house or condominium slopeside or at mountain base, starting prices are typically $2,225,000 and $800,000, respectively. Total sales were up 44 per cent in the region year-over-year. </p><p>\"Home prices in the region have reached historically high levels, as demand continues to outstrip available inventory,\" said Frank Ingham, associate broker, Royal LePage Sussex. \"Most buyers are in their mid-forties to mid-fifties from Vancouver, looking for a secondary property - a place to escape the city and enjoy winter activities on the weekends.\"</p><p>Ingham noted a significant increase in demand for luxury recreational properties this year, compared to a typical season prior to the pandemic, as buyers are seeking accommodations for more people, and for longer stays. </p><p>\"We've also seen an uptick in activity from our neighbours south of the border. Whistler and the surrounding areas of Pemberton and Squamish have always been popular recreation destinations for skiers and mountain bikers from Seattle, Washington. With the beneficial exchange rate and Canada's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm not surprised that so many Americans are looking to purchase properties here,\" added Ingham.</p><p>Ingham added that the recent flooding in southwestern B.C. has not impacted market activity in the region. A fresh snowfall made for an excellent opening ski day on Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains at the end of November. </p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Whistler will rise 4.0 per cent over the next year, due to a continued shortage of housing supply.</p><p>Invermere</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the median price of a single-family detached home in Invermere's recreational property market increased 20.5 per cent year-over-year to $559,000, while the median price of a condominium increased 27.0 per cent to $244,200. However, for those looking to buy a house or condominium slopeside or at mountain base, starting prices are typically $380,000 and $225,000, respectively. Total sales were up 48 per cent in the region year-over-year. </p><p>\"Over the last two years, demand in the region has remained consistently higher than in the years prior to the pandemic, as many Canadians re-evaluate their lifestyles and what they want out of a home and a community,\" said Barry Benson, broker, Royal LePage Rockies West Realty. \"Invermere is more than just a recreational destination. It offers great value for buyers who are looking for more space, work-life balance and a better quality of life, year-round. The ability to work remotely has made that option possible for more families.\"</p><p>Benson added that activity in the region has not been directly affected by recent flooding elsewhere in the province, as the main source of demand comes from Alberta buyers.</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Invermere will increase 7.0 per cent over the next year, as demand continues to rise.</p><p>Revelstoke</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the median price of a single-family detached home in Revelstoke's recreational property market increased 19.3 per cent year-over-year to $751,500, while the median price of a condominium increased 6.2 per cent to $563,000. However, for those looking to buy a house or condominium slopeside or at mountain base, starting prices are typically $3,000,000 and $450,000, respectively. Total sales were up 30 per cent in the region year-over-year.</p><p>\"New developments will be completed in Revelstoke over the course of the next two years, which will help to relieve some of the pressure on supply. However, prices are expected to continue rising, as demand remains very strong across all housing types,\" said Don Teuton, broker and owner, Royal LePage Revelstoke. \"As a popular destination for skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling and other outdoor winter adventures, the region has always attracted recreational property buyers. Today, there is increased demand for primary residences from those who wish to work remotely from a small town.\"</p><p>Teuton noted that while the region has not been directly affected by recent flooding elsewhere in the province, market activity is currently experiencing its usual seasonal slowdown.</p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in Revelstoke will rise 10.0 per cent over the next year, as high demand continues to outstrip supply. The total number of sales is expected to decrease over the coming year, due to a significant lack of inventory.</p><p>Mount Washington/Comox Valley</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the median price of a single-family detached home in the Mount Washington/Comox Valley region's recreational property market increased 33.3 per cent year-over-year to $800,000, while the median price of a condominium increased 19.1 per cent to $375,000. However, for those looking to buy a house or condominium slopeside or at mountain base, starting prices are typically $900,000 and $325,000, respectively. Total sales were up 14 per cent in the region year-over-year.</p><p>\"Mount Washington is a popular choice among ski and snowboard enthusiasts, as well as families looking to get away from the city and enjoy nature together,\" said Rick Gibson, sales representative, Royal LePage in the Comox Valley. \"There is strong appeal in the summer months as well. Being just 45 minutes from the coast and close to lots of great restaurants, shops and golf courses, the region is in high demand among buyers seeking a year-round recreational property, as well as those looking to relocate permanently; a growing trend in recent years.\"</p><p>Gibson noted that demand from lower mainland buyers has increased in recent months, as a result of forest fire and flooding issues elsewhere in the province. </p><p>Royal LePage is forecasting that the median price of a single-family detached home in the region of Mount Washington/Comox Valley will rise 10.0 per cent over the next year, due to continued strong demand and low supply. </p><p>Data chart - Royal LePage 2021 Winter Recreational Property Report: rlp.ca/table_2021winterrecreationalreport</p><p>Royal LePage Royalty-Free Media Assets:</p><p>Royal LePage's media room contains royalty-free assets, such as images and b-roll, that are free for media use. </p><p>Quebec's Bromont region posted the highest year-over-year median price appreciation in the single-family detached segment (58.7% to $607,000) Median price of Ontario's Southern Georgian Bay condominiums increased 51.4% year-over-year to $651,000; the highest appreciation of all recreational areas surveyed Whistler, B.C., and Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, are the only two regions that reported an increase in U.S. buyer demand since the reopening of the land border earlier this year</p><p>About the Royal LePage Winter Recreational Property Report</p><p>The 2021 Royal LePage Winter Recreational Property Report compiles insights, data and forecasts from 14 popular ski regions.

A trillion trees, it was said at that meeting of the World Economic Forum, would go a long way in addressing climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while trees - and particularly forests full of trees - are vital for swallowing up and storing carbon, and currently absorb 30 per cent of planet-warming carbon dioxide, they are also extremely vulnerable in the age of climate disruptions.</p><p>In a hotter, drier, more flammable climate, like here in the Mediterranean region, forests can die slowly from drought, or they can go up in flames almost instantly, releasing all the carbon stored in their trunks and branches into the atmosphere.</p><p>That raises an increasingly urgent question: How best to manage woodlands in a world that humans have so profoundly altered? \"We need to decide what will be the climate-change forest for the future,\" is how Kirsten Thonicke, a fire ecologist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, framed the challenge.</p><p>A forest revival in Europe is forcing that discussion now.</p><p>Today roughly 40 per cent of the European Union's land mass is covered by trees, making it one of the most forest-rich regions in the world. It's also ripe for wildfire.</p><p>In 2019, intense heat and drought helped spread fires across roughly 1,300 square miles on the Continent, a swath of scorched land 15 per cent bigger than the decade's annual average, according to preliminary data issued in mid-January by the European Forest Fire Information System.</p><p>Marc Castellnou, a 47-year-old fire analyst with the Catalonian fire services, has seen that shift firsthand here in the hot, dry hills of Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where his family has lived for generations in a medieval village overlooking the Ebro River.</p><p>His mother's family grew almonds up here. The terraces they once hacked into these hard rocks still remain, along with the brick oven of the old farmhouse and a row of juniper trees, which, by local custom, signalled to anyone walking up from the coast that they could barter their fish for bread there.</p><p>The almond orchard has long been abandoned. In its place, a scrubby forest of short oaks and white pines has come up. Where goats once grazed, there is now a carpet of dry grass. A perfect landscape for fire.</p><p>What happened with his ancestors' farm has played out across Europe, profoundly altering the countryside over the past half century. As farmers walked away from the land in favour of less back-breaking, more profitable ventures, forests came back.</p><p>Now Castellnou has been setting some of those forests ablaze, getting rid of the grasses and low-lying shrub so the flames cannot as easily race up to the crowns of the young, frail pines. The last thing he wants his two young children to inherit is a hillside strewn with dry, flammable brush.</p><p>\"Climate change is changing everything,\" Castellnou said. \"We're trying to build some vaccination into the landscape.\"</p><p>In Europe last year, wildfires raged as far north as Sweden. Drought and beetle infestations killed swaths of forests in Germany, prompting a debate over what trees to plant in their place. Britain had more wildfires last year than ever before on record. Spain saw one of the sharpest increases in the number of individual fires. The European Union described forest fires as \"a serious and increasing threat.\"</p><p>The forests of Europe have been shaped and reshaped by human hands over centuries. Trees were cut for fuel and timber, then terraced so farmers like Castellnou's forebears could plant whatever would fetch the most money.</p><p>His ancestors chose a steep hillside and planted almonds. The grandparents of his wife, Rut Dom\u00e8nech, 39, cultivated hazelnuts. Nearly everyone had olives to supply oil for the year. Some grew grapes to make wine. Every bit of hill was under cultivation.</p><p>By the second half of the 20th century, Catalonians had begun abandoning the steepest, hardest-to-farm hillsides in favour of the valleys, where machines and fertilizers made farming easier and more productive.</p><p>Castellnou's father gave up working on other people's almond orchards altogether. He helped construct a new highway, then a new nuclear power plant in the next town, then went to work in a factory making wooden picture frames.</p><p>With the nuclear plant nearby, locals prospered. Dom\u00e8nech's father found construction work. Her mother opened a boutique in the next town.</p><p>Farming fell out of favour. The shepherds sold their animals.</p><p>Across Europe, between 1950 and 2010, amid rapid postwar reconstruction, woods and grasslands grew by roughly 150,000 square miles.</p><p>Farmers in the Montsant wine region of Catalonia now harvest earlier in the season; the heat sweetens the grapes too early, leading to higher alcohol content, and some worry whether they'll have to switch to dessert wines.</p><p>On an exceptionally hot day last summer, on a poultry farm, a pile of manure caught fire, as mounds of animal waste have done before. But so fierce was the wind that the embers travelled across the hills, causing fires up to 13 miles (21 kilometres) away.</p><p>Fire, Castellnou pointed out more than once, is nature's way of reshaping the landscape for the future. What will come up on these denuded hills will be less homogeneous, he said, and more resilient for a new climate.</p><p>He favours what he calls managed burns, getting rid of low brush in order to prevent the next fire from raging out of control. And sometimes, he favours letting fires burn. It's part of the natural ecology of the forest, he said. The white pines, for instance, reproduce only during fires, when their seed pods explode in the heat.</p><p>\"Instead of fighting fire, making peace with fire,\" Castellnou advised.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2020020657134899</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y54-GVJ1-F103-30K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

All are possible, but the threat of a catastrophic forest fire may be the most likely, since most of us live surrounded by mature boreal forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Old Crow is in the midst of a spruce forest that has burned in the recent past, creating dangerous levels of smoke. Telegraph Creek was destroyed by fire two years ago.</p><p>It's January and we are watching Australia burn. That's a good reason to start preparing for our summer.</p><p>If you live within 100 meters of a greenbelt you should be looking at your own backyard and asking yourself what will happen when embers are raining down.</p><p>Keith is worried about cedar shakes but I'd like to add the following things to worry about: firewood piles, dead leaves, piles of spruce and pine cones, dry shrubs and grasses, old lumber, and so on.</p><p>All of those hazards can be reduced by the homeowner and should be done by the end of April. There will be no point spraying your cedar shakes with the garden hose if all other flammable items have not been removed or managed.</p><p>As you clean up your backyard, if you notice a 'logging' operation in the surrounding greenbelt, try to be appreciative and supportive. That initiative may save your house and much of the neighbourhood during the next hot, dry spell.</p><p>Keith mentioned that many of us may have only five minutes worth of gas in the car.</p><p>Even a half tank may not help your exit from Whitehorse. Keeping a full tank of gas during extreme fire weather periods is your first line of defense when planning your evacuation.</p><p>We may not know what the government plan is for a community evacuation, but we do have control over our gas tank. If the weather is hot and dry, we should be paying attention to the fire hazard and keeping a full tank of gas.</p><p>The best plan is to know what you will do during hot, dry weather and how you will react when a fire happens. We should all have an escape plan and 72 hours worth of supplies.</p><p>We shouldn't wait for a government plan. Even if there is a plan, it may not work. Paradise, California had a plan but it was not activated, due to poor communication. Australia didn't have a plan because the government is in denial.</p><p>Go ahead, hope and pray that a fire won't happen, if that makes you feel prepared. Otherwise, it might be a good idea to use time in January, February and March to plan for a fire.</p><p>We don't know when a catastrophic fire will happen but there is a lot that we can do every year to be better prepared.</p><p>Mike Gladish</p><p>Member of Citizens for a Firesmart Whitehorse</p><p>We standby our opinions on biomass</p><p>On Jan. 17 Yukon News published letters from Yukon Wood Products Association and TransNorthern Consulting critiquing our commentary of Jan 10 in which we made three points: biomass energy (burning wood) is a net contributor of carbon to the atmosphere annually (so is not carbon neutral); those carbon emissions need to be part of Yukon's annual carbon reporting; although burning wood is well established in Yukon, future increases in the biomass sector will worsen our carbon footprint.</p><p>We know the authors of the letters, respect their experience in the forest industry, and thank them for their interest in this topic.</p><p>They provide two major arguments in favour of burning wood. First, they assert that biomass energy is carbon neutral. Their argument is based on the fact that tree growth will absorb similar volumes of carbon as are emitted by burning, when the full life-time of the tree is considered.</p><p>Although that is true, the full life-time of the tree is not the appropriate time period for carbon accounting. As with carbon emissions from all other sources, carbon emissions from wood have to be accounted for annually. When trees are burned, large amounts of carbon are emitted but relatively small amounts are re-absorbed during the same year.</p><p>Consequently there is a net addition of carbon to the atmosphere annually. By definition this means that burning wood cannot be carbon neutral. There is a large body of science and policy analysis around the world making this point.</p><p>It is the long time period (often decades) required for trees to eventually re-absorb the carbon from burning that is incompatible with the urgency of the climate crisis. We have to reduce emissions annually to have any chance of meeting our national targets.</p><p>The core of the second argument is that some timber harvesting is needed to reduce fire risk, because the vicinities of many Yukon communities support mature forests that will likely burn with high risk to humans in coming decades. This is a valid argument, and we agree that fuel abatement is desirable.</p><p>This argument then goes another step by saying that the resulting wood and \"wood waste\" should be burned, often in boiler installations.</p><p>That point may be valid, given that Teslin and Whitehorse already have boilers, but depends on the economics of extraction and transport. Those boilers have an existing carbon footprint that will continue using one wood source or another, so wood from wild-fire fuel abatement is appropriate. However, some of that wood could go to other purposes (dimension lumber; chipped on site for nutrient cycling), so burning it does not necessarily follow from the need to cut it.</p><p>The argument about reducing fire risk does not actually speak to the question of how climate-friendly biomass is. Biomass is a net contributor to Yukon's carbon footprint, so we stand by our point that increasing the scale and scope of this energy source in Yukon will not be climate-friendly.</p><p>Donald Reid and Hilary Cooke</p><p>Wildlife Conservation Society Canada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-3939820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2F-5BD1-F103-33J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yukon News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000183</classCode><className>BIOMASS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL43</classCode><className>NEGATIVE TECHNOLOGY NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001330</classCode><className>PLANETS &amp; ASTEROIDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000183</classCode><className>BIOMASS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001359</classCode><className>POWER FAILURES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX356</classCode><className>WHITEHORSE, YT, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS178</classCode><className>YUKON TERRITORY, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

At least 25 humans dead, 480 million animals wiped out, 2,000 homes perished in fires equivalent to the size of Nova Scotia blazing across Australia. But these figures that have caught international attention don't adequately capture the fear and uncertainty on the ground, the children jumping into lakes, the firefighters doubling and trebling their efforts and residents living in a perpetual state of heightened alarm.</p><p>In popular Canadian imagination, Australia is an identical twin, down to the colonial violence that marks its birth. It's just warmer and more vibrant.</p><p>So many Canadians volunteered to go fight the fires themselves that the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre which is co-ordinating the Canadian response had to intervene.</p><p>\"While Australia does use volunteer firefighters, these firefighters are familiar with and trained to specific standards relative to firefighting in Australian conditions,\" a note on its website says. It requests that people not overload the Australian state fire services by contacting them directly.</p><p>I, too, have personal stakes in the catastrophe. The smoke there chokes me here. My sister and brother live in Sydney. For my young nieces, breathing the world's worst air right now, climate change isn't some intangible peril of the future but an omnipresent danger whose status is constantly updated on fire services apps, one that demands a preparedness to flee at a moment's notice.</p><p>\"We haven't seen blue skies in three months,\" my brother told me. \"The sun has been a hazy orange since September.\"</p><p>Suburban Sydneysiders are the fortunate ones that have escaped - so far - the ravages of coastal green belts and the combustible eucalyptus treed-Blue Mountains nearby.</p><p>There was that one night when my brother awoke to find the house filled with smoke. They'd already swept the dried leaves off the roof gutters. But the danger of flying embers on extremely dry wood is real. Despite Level 1 water restrictions (with Level 6 the most severe), he and a few neighbours sprayed the roof that day. \"How does one decide between letting the house burn and saving water?\"</p><p>Bellantonio is a senior deputy captain of a fire fighters brigade. At the state level, he is also a member of an aviation rescue crew. Like most Australian firefighters he's a volunteer. He has lost count of the number of fires he has fought.</p><p>\"Many, many, many,\" he said. Some are \"small events,\" other large. A year without major fires or floods works out to three or four weeks of volunteering. This year he estimates it's already been two or three months. Bellantonio is self-employed, which means no work no money. He thinks he's out of pocket \"20 grand easily.\" But \"there are thousands of firefighters like me,\" he said.</p><p>\"As a small population living in a very large country it is essential for all of us to pull together and help each other out.\"</p><p>A month ago, he said, he was in an aircraft flying up the coast from Sydney to the mid-north. \"All the way up the visibility was so bad we could barely fly. It was just smoke. When you look at the grounds as far as the eye can see, it's just fire.\"</p><p>\"Next year, there will be nothing left to burn,\" he added.</p><p>The dryness that made Australia a tinder box much like California and the Brazilian rainforest has come following a prolonged drought that experts blame on climate change caused by emissions of heat-trapping gases. Another reason they are spreading so devastatingly is poor land management.</p><p>\"There is no doubt traditional ways and methods of burning were far superior to what we're doing these days,\" Bellantonio said.</p><p>These fires \"are the consequence of failing to heed to warnings from First Nations all around this country, failure to indigenize land management and implement it with control of the First Nations that can read country,\" writes Natalie Cromb, a Gamilaraay woman, author and activist from Sydney in IndigenousX.</p><p>Last year, Indigenous cultural burning was reintroduced in the state of Victoria for the first time in almost 200 years, something brought back in after consultations with Indigenous peoples in North America.</p><p>However, the best strategies in Australia might come to naught in the face of the country's dangerous leader. Vacationing in Hawaii while the fires raged on was possibly the most innocuous of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's decisions.</p><p>Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and natural gas. Like the Liberals here who claim to support an environmental agenda while promoting oil extraction, political parties there speak from both sides of their mouths, but with coal mining. There is even a bipartisan group named - wait for it - Parliamentary Friends of Australian Coal Exports.</p><p>Morrison, who just last month was seeking to outlaw protests by environmentalists, embodies politicians who are not accountable to land, even to their much-vaunted \"private property.\" The prime minister's support of coal and war on climate activists despite the fires decimating his countrypeople, left wing or right, shows that when it comes to power, these politicians are not even accountable to the people that vote for them.</p><p>Shree Paradkar is a Toronto-based staff columnist covering issues around race and gender.

For instance, it's harder - and sometimes impossible - to hunt caribou because the ice and permafrost they travel on isn't stable enough for hunters.</p><p>\"Climate change threatens to decimate these food systems, risking further serious consequences for livelihoods and health,\" the report states.</p><p>First Nations children are going to school hungry more often, Rall said, and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes aren't always able to follow their medically prescribed diets. Some First Nations people skip meals altogether, the report notes.</p><p>The report also found that climate change is driving up prices for less-nutritious, store-bought alternatives that need to be brought in from the south. This is in part due to the fact that roads constructed from snow and ice are becoming less reliable because of warmer winters, meaning food needs to be flown in, which is far more expensive. This compounds the risk of food poverty for First Nations people, the report states.</p><p>\"All the things we documented are going to get much, much worse in the coming years, and certainly, if there's no appropriate action to reduce emissions, the future scenario is really devastating,\" she said.</p><p>Not only that, Indigenous Peoples in Canada are among the lowest contributors to greenhouse emissions in the country, yet research shows they are among the most exposed to climate change impacts.</p><p>Canada gets a failing grade on mitigating the effects of climate change, according to the report. The country is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, with per capita emissions upward of four times higher than the global average, the report states, noting that between 1990 and 2017, emissions increased by roughly 19 per cent, mainly due to mining and oil and gas production.</p><p>Canada is warming roughly twice as fast as the global average; in the North, it's even worse, with temperatures rising three times as quick.</p><p>While the Government of Canada has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050, it remains unclear how it intends to pull off these goals, Rall said.</p><p>\"This needs to urgently change,\" she said.</p><p>The northernmost community researchers focused on was the Gwich'in community of Old Crow, Yukon, which can only be reached by air travel. This is a place where citizens spend 41 per cent of their monthly budgets on healthy food, according to the report. In Whitehorse, which is roughly 800 kilometres south of Old Crow, families spend 17.5 per cent of their budget on the same diet.</p><p>Researchers heard from citizens that harvesting seasons are truncated, with access to flora and fauna in the area increasingly limited. This is leading more people to the grocery store, where prices can be inflated for fresh produce that has a very short shelf life.</p><p>Dana Tizya-Tramm, Chief of Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of Old Crow, told The Narwhal that citizens are, indeed, seeing climate change effects happening right before their eyes. Five lakes in the area have been draining at an increased rate, a known effect of permafrost thaw, which is causing the land to give way and cloud the waters, he said. And drunken forests - where trees dramatically lean due to thawing permafrost - are more common now, he added.</p><p>There are also fewer Porcupine caribou, a sacred animal to the Gwich'in, Tizya-Tramm said. He chalks this up to a species of willow choking out lichen, a staple food source for caribou, but isn't sure if the willows are driven by climate change. An increase in forest fires may also be affecting the herd's migratory patterns, he added. (The range of the Porcupine caribou spans from Alaska to the Northwest Territories.)</p><p>\"If we don't have access to our foods and begin to lose that culture, if our youth are not getting out with our elders, then of course that leaves them without the skills or the confidence [to hunt], which leads back to the stores for food, which atrophies that traditional link,\" he said.</p><p>\"The change that we're seeing now signals a paradigm shift that is going to come in our environment. Humans continue to push nature to its edge.\"</p><p>Canada needs to commit to more concrete action, not just make another announcement, Rall said.</p><p>While there are some good government programs, they still have problems that need to be ironed out, she added.</p><p>Take Nutrition North, which launched in 2011 and subsidizes the delivery of nutritious food from the south to northern locales. Unfortunately, even with the delivery subsidized, the food is still prohibitively expensive for some people.</p><p>The carbon tax could also drive up food prices for First Nations, the report says.</p><p>\"While the policy includes a tax-based rebate intended to mitigate the impacts of these price increases on lower-income people, the federal government has acknowledged this method is ineffective for First Nations given legislated tax exemptions that mean many First Nations people on-reserve do not file federal tax returns,\" the report states.</p><p>Human Rights Watch lays out several recommendations for the federal government, including that Canada deem the right to food a basic human right, strengthen its climate change policies to reduce emissions, improve climate adaptation measures in First Nations and support a transition toward renewable energy, including for First Nations, in the COVID-19 stimulus package.</p><p>\"Ultimately, Canada's climate policies are insufficient and poorly designed, contributing to a double bind for First Nation Peoples,\" the report states.</p><p>Asked whether the federal government will accept the recommendations, a spokesperson from Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs didn't explicitly answer.</p><p>\"We participated in the research behind this report, and we welcome its conclusions as important contributions to the wider conversation around climate change,\" Christina Tricomi said in an email. \"We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with Inuit, First Nation and M&amp;#233;tis communities, provincial and territorial governments, other federal departments and other governments and organizations around the world to address immediate concerns and find long-term solutions to these complex challenges.\"</p><p>Of all of the jurisdictions that Human Rights Watch looked at, Yukon was the only one that is \"taking its obligation to address climate change impacts on First Nations, including their right to food, seriously,\" the report says.</p><p>The Yukon government's climate change strategy, which was released in September, sets in motion work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the territory by 30 per cent from 2010 levels. But it also seeks to address food insecurity. By 2023, for instance, the Yukon government wants to analyze the extent of the issue in a bid to create a system that tracks levels of food insecurity into the future.</p><p>Under the strategy, the government will aim to complete risk assessments and emergency plans for every Yukon community by 2022.</p><p>Human Rights Watch recommends the Yukon government implement a program to monitor First Nations food insecurity linked to climate change as soon as possible.</p><p>Roxanne Stasyszyn, a spokesperson for Environment Yukon, said the Yukon government has already committed to monitoring food insecurity through its climate change strategy.</p><p>\"It seems like there's awareness and acknowledgement that this is important,\" Rall told The Narwhal. \"Their plan is really a step in the right direction in that it commits to assessing climate impacts on food insecurity and also that First Nations people are central in finding a response to climate change.\"</p><p>\"What needs to happen now, of course, is to implement all those commitments.\"</p><p>Editor's disclosure: Julien Gignac, the author of this article, worked as an independent consultant for Human Right Watch in 2017 for an unrelated project that documented the experiences of Indigenous women and distrust toward the RCMP.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020102159195172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6144-TSS1-JDH1-C0G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

At least 25 humans dead, 480 million animals wiped out, 2,000 homes perished in fires equivalent to the size of Nova Scotia blazing across Australia. But these figures that have caught international attention don't adequately capture the fear and uncertainty on the ground, the children jumping into lakes, the firefighters doubling and trebling their efforts and residents living in a perpetual state of heightened alarm.</p><p>In popular Canadian imagination, Australia is an identical twin, down to the colonial violence that marks its birth. It's just warmer and more vibrant.</p><p>So many Canadians volunteered to go fight the fires themselves that the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre which is co-ordinating the Canadian response had to intervene.</p><p>\"While Australia does use volunteer firefighters, these firefighters are familiar with and trained to specific standards relative to firefighting in Australian conditions,\" a note on its website says. It requests that people not overload the Australian state fire services by contacting them directly.</p><p>I, too, have personal stakes in the catastrophe. The smoke there chokes me here. My sister and brother live in Sydney. For my young nieces, breathing the world's worst air right now, climate change isn't some intangible peril of the future but an omnipresent danger whose status is constantly updated on fire services apps, one that demands a preparedness to flee at a moment's notice.</p><p>\"We haven't seen blue skies in three months,\" my brother told me. \"The sun has been a hazy orange since September.\"</p><p>Suburban Sydneysiders are the fortunate ones that have escaped - so far - the ravages of coastal green belts and the combustible eucalyptus treed-Blue Mountains nearby.</p><p>There was that one night when my brother awoke to find the house filled with smoke. They'd already swept the dried leaves off the roof gutters. But the danger of flying embers on extremely dry wood is real. Despite Level 1 water restrictions (with Level 6 the most severe), he and a few neighbours sprayed the roof that day. \"How does one decide between letting the house burn and saving water?\"</p><p>Bellantonio is a senior deputy captain of a fire fighters brigade. At the state level, he is also a member of an aviation rescue crew. Like most Australian firefighters he's a volunteer. He has lost count of the number of fires he has fought.</p><p>\"Many, many, many,\" he said. Some are \"small events,\" other large. A year without major fires or floods works out to three or four weeks of volunteering. This year he estimates it's already been two or three months. Bellantonio is self-employed, which means no work no money. He thinks he's out of pocket \"20 grand easily.\" But \"there are thousands of firefighters like me,\" he said.</p><p>\"As a small population living in a very large country it is essential for all of us to pull together and help each other out.\"</p><p>A month ago, he said, he was in an aircraft flying up the coast from Sydney to the mid-north. \"All the way up the visibility was so bad we could barely fly. It was just smoke. When you look at the grounds as far as the eye can see, it's just fire.\"</p><p>\"Next year, there will be nothing left to burn,\" he added.</p><p>The dryness that made Australia a tinder box much like California and the Brazilian rainforest has come following a prolonged drought that experts blame on climate change caused by emissions of heat-trapping gases. Another reason they are spreading so devastatingly is poor land management.</p><p>\"There is no doubt traditional ways and methods of burning were far superior to what we're doing these days,\" Bellantonio said.</p><p>These fires \"are the consequence of failing to heed to warnings from First Nations all around this country, failure to indigenize land management and implement it with control of the First Nations that can read country,\" writes Natalie Cromb, a Gamilaraay woman, author and activist from Sydney in IndigenousX.</p><p>Last year, Indigenous cultural burning was reintroduced in the state of Victoria for the first time in almost 200 years, something brought back in after consultations with Indigenous peoples in North America.</p><p>However, the best strategies in Australia might come to naught in the face of the country's dangerous leader. Vacationing in Hawaii while the fires raged on was possibly the most innocuous of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's decisions.</p><p>Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and natural gas. Like the Liberals here who claim to support an environmental agenda while promoting oil extraction, political parties there speak from both sides of their mouths, but with coal mining. There is even a bipartisan group named - wait for it - Parliamentary Friends of Australian Coal Exports.</p><p>Morrison, who just last month was seeking to outlaw protests by environmentalists, embodies politicians who are not accountable to land, even to their much-vaunted \"private property.\" The prime minister's support of coal and war on climate activists despite the fires decimating his countrypeople, left wing or right, shows that when it comes to power, these politicians are not even accountable to the people that vote for them.</p><p>Shree Paradkar is a Toronto-based staff columnist covering issues around race and gender.

It has been more than a week since anyone was found alive, and the emotional and psychological fatigue is taking its toll.

The Bruders have lived in the region for over a century and his parents spent many years on different boards and volunteer committees. </p><p>\u201cThis rubbed off on me. I feel that it is my obligation to give back to my community, and I feel that I have valuable skills to provide,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cI have spent my whole life here,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd I want my kids and their families to be able to somewhat experience the life I was fortunate enough to have lived.\u201d </p><p>He has been chairman of the Drywood Yarrow Conservation Partnership for 11 years, is involved with the Waterton Biosphere Reserve and is a board member of the Twin Butte Community Hall.  </p><p>He spent many years on the Agriculture Service Board for the MD of Pincher Creek, the Pincher Creek and District Agricultural Society and was leader of the Foothills 4-H Beef Club. He is a longtime coach of junior and senior volleyball at both Pincher Creek high schools. </p><p>Bruder has learned to work with diverse groups of people through both rough and prosperous times. </p><p>\u201cI am not afraid to stick my neck out and make the tough decisions when needed,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I also appreciate those times when it's best to just sit back and listen.\u201d </p><p>Bruder advocates for more collaboration between local councils and industries. He feels a need to bring people of the MD and town back together and to work together to achieve a vibrant community as a whole, and believes this can be done. </p><p>He says heightened collaboration between the MD, Town of Pincher Creek and other smaller urban areas could increase efficiency.  </p><p>He views the tourism industry as an economic driver for the MD while acknowledging that it needs to work with the established agriculture and energy sectors, and that young people are needed to keep things going. </p><p>\u201cWe need to figure out a way to bring this all together. It should not be one against the other. These sectors have to and should be able to work together,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cThere are some capital projects that have been completed or are ongoing within the municipalities in spite of one another, rather than to the benefit of all,\u201d he explains. </p><p>\u201cI think this needs to change going into the future. It should not be an us-versus-them scenario within our own community.\u201d </p><p>He is interested in developing recreation facilities and activities to keep younger families in the area, which he says would help the local energy and agriculture sectors. </p><p>He is against the creation of multiple subdivisions with the MD and thinks council could use better financial management. </p><p>Financial management is also a priority for Bruder. </p><p>\u201cI feel that there is a need of running a tighter budget within the MD and am willing to work on this issue. If I ran my ranch like most government bodies do, I would have been broke many times over,\u201d he says. </p><p>He is confident the energy sector, including mining, has changed for the better and believes environmental concerns are being taken seriously now. </p><p>\u201cI fully understand the importance of good clean water, but, on the other hand, I understand the economic benefits to not only the immediate community, but to the province and country,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel that this can be done in an environmentally sound way.\u201d  </p><p>\u201cI admit that I have a strong personality, but I also feel that I have an open mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI can listen to other people's views and form opinions based on all facts presented. To me, the bottom line is what is the best for our community, not just now, but into the future.\u201d </p><p>Division 2 </p><p>RICK LEMIRE (incumbent, elected by acclamation) </p><p>What Rick Lemire has learned from his role as councillor is that leadership comes with great responsibility. </p><p>\u201cI've seen good discussion lead to a compromise on an issue so it becomes a win-win rather than winners and losers,\u201d he says. \u201cAlbeit there are times when a hard decision is the only way to an outcome and one must not dwell on the decision but move on.\u201d </p><p>Lemire was elected in 2017 and says he\u2019s learned a lot from his constituents. </p><p>\u201dThere is still lots of work to do,\u201d he says. \u201cMy job is not done yet.\u201d </p><p>Prior to serving on council, Lemire was a trustee for the St. Michael\u2019s School Division, which went on to become the Holy Spirit Catholic School Division. He has coached schools sports and minor hockey, and been a 4-H leader. </p><p>He will continue to support council transparency and prioritizing of asset management, a revised strategic plan, economic growth and improvement of the road network. </p><p>Lemire thinks the MD should take a close look at the airport as an economic booster. </p><p>\u201cI believe there are some possible developments which could be studied to attract tourism, industry, flight school and hospitality to the greater MD community,\u201d he explains. </p><p>\u201cThe best advice,\u201d he says, \u201cis to have financial goals set to include short, long and reactionary plans. These are achieved through teamwork providing input and knowledge for the good of the MD.\u201d </p><p>He looks positively on coal mine development, but says projects must be thoroughly researched before any development takes place. </p><p>\u201cThese choices also impact our environment, water and viewscape and must be well researched to provide the facts before any development should be done,\u201d says Lemire. </p><p>\u201cWe are strategically located at the headwaters of the eastern slopes so we have the most to be concerned about with reference to development in the area.\u201d </p><p>Lemire has an open-door policy and says constituents from any division are welcome to connect with him. </p><p>\u201cI'm a councillor for the whole MD, not just Division 2,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cI would like to thank the four councillors who will not be sitting at the table after Oct. 18,\u201d he concludes. \u201cYou have left me with the following traits: leadership, wisdom, compassion and patience. It has been a privilege to serve next to you. I wish you a restful and healthy departure. Happy trails.\u201d </p><p>Division 3 </p><p>DAVID COX </p><p>David Cox describes himself as an honest, hard-working and objective person with good listening skills. He has the time available and wants to bring a new perspective to the MD council table. </p><p>\u201cI've spent the bigger part of my working life in public service and continue to want to help people in need,\u201d he says. </p><p>Formerly chief of Pincher Creek Emergency Services Commission, he supplied the community with ambulance, fire and rescue response teams from three different stations. </p><p>Cox is a director and secretary-treasurer for Region 7 of the Alberta Fire Chiefs Association and has served on a variety of committees dealing with public land use. He is also a member of the Pincher Creek Emergency Services Brigade fundraising group. </p><p>He believes his background with PCESC provided experiences in leadership, structure and accountability that will make him an effective councillor. Managing the budget and financial planning for PCESC and for Cowley Forest Products has prepared him to do similar work for the MD.  </p><p>If elected, Cox would work on supporting and recruiting businesses. </p><p>\u201cI am open to proposals recognizing that limits due to location or negative potential impacts will determine viability,\u201d he says. </p><p>Council transparency, efficient use of funds and maintaining revenue streams would also be top priorities. </p><p>\u201cMy vision of our community is a strong agriculture sector and successful diversity in other businesses. We need to have opportunities for the young to stay in this community,\u201d he says. </p><p>Cox has yet to research the benefits and impacts of mining development and does not yet have an opinion on the issue. </p><p>GARRY MARCHUK </p><p>Marchuk says the community will need strong leadership going forward to keep up with a busy and ever-changing world, and he\u2019s willing to take on the challenge. </p><p>He spent five years as a councillor for the MD of Pincher Creek and believes his past experience lends well to the job, including financial decision-making. </p><p>\u201cThere are programs that I would like to see move forward to create employment and help grow our economy. There are some things that the MD can do better and all ratepayers deserve the best that we can provide,\u201d he says. </p><p>Marchuk describes himself as committed, inclusive, fair-minded, approachable and tenacious. </p><p>\u201cIt is important to seek out, hear, respect and consider all points of view. I invite everyone to share with me your questions, concerns, opinions and in-turn I will give you a fair and clear response or find the answer,\u201d he says. </p><p>He is in favour of job creation, but not willing to put water at risk through coal mining in the eastern slopes. </p><p>He is interested in growing the economy and creating jobs through renewables.  </p><p>\u201cI would like to see wind power, solar power, the Town of Pincher Creek, the MD of Pincher Creek and the local ranching community form a co-operative to build some off-the-grid greenhouses for the production of fresh healthy vegetables for local consumption,\u201d he explains. </p><p>If elected, he would advocate for fiscal responsibility, emergency services, fire protection and fire breaks, and term maximums. </p><p>Marchuk is a former president of Beaver Mines Community Association and of Joe\u2019s Weight Training Centre. He has also been a volunteer firefighter. </p><p>Currently, he is a board director for Community Futures Alberta Southwest. </p><p>\u201cAs a municipal councillor, once I committed to a position I followed through and gave it my best effort. No one person is more important than the other but rather it is the engagement of many that gets the task done,\u201d he says. </p><p>Division 4 </p><p>HAROLD HOLLINGSHEAD </p><p>Harold Hollingshead is running in response to dysfunction in local emergency services or, more specifically, \u201cthe response to fires in our area and residents\u2019 readiness to fight these fires.\u201d </p><p>If elected, Hollingshead would work toward improving emergency services, resolving Beaver Mines water and sewer issues, and addressing frustrations surrounding road and bridge infrastructure. </p><p>Hollingshead has run a farm for three decades and owned a business for 14 years before that. He currently sits on the board of directors for the Pincher Creek Co-op. </p><p>He is not in favour of mining the eastern slopes and instead advocates for agriculture as the primary economic driver in the community. </p><p>\u201cOur water is one of, if not the most important part of our ecosystem. My neighbours that irrigate out of the Oldman had their water shut off in August from low flow in the Oldman River. If there are any new industrial users upriver they may not have any water, or at least reduced availability,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cAgriculture is the most important economic driver in our MD and the council should endeavour to support all aspects of agriculture.\u201d </p><p>JIM WELSCH </p><p>Jim Welsch wants to provide a strong voice for agriculture in the MD. </p><p>\u201cI am passionate about seeing the ag industry succeed,\u201d he says. </p><p>As a rancher with extensive community involvement in the agriculture sector, he has first-hand experience with the industry. </p><p>He is chairman of the MD\u2019s municipal planning committee and vice-chairman of the Chief Mountain Gas Co-op board of directors, and a past board member of Community Auction Sales Association Ltd. and past chairman of the Pincher Creek and District 4-H Beef Committee. </p><p>\u201cI have valuable experience from the past and current positions I have held,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had to demonstrate leadership, co-operation, communication and respect.\u201d  </p><p>Dealing with significant financial decisions is a regular part of Welsch\u2019s agricultural operation. Working regularly with current MD council members for 2\u00bd years on the MPC inspired him to seek election. </p><p>He says his top priorities include investigating firefighting policy, agriculture, emergency services and tax base for revenue. </p><p>Division 5 </p><p>CHUCK LEE </p><p>Chuck Lee describes himself as a man with a head for business and a heart for the environment, and his ideal council would consider both equally.   </p><p>Growing up, Lee assisted with his father\u2019s commercial cow-calf operation. His industry connection extends to his platform and he intends to advocate for the continuation of agricultural land protection policies, steer development into the area, and promote rural business. </p><p>\u201cIt is small incremental growth that is sustainable and will be more resilient and less susceptible to outside influences that will be our pathway forward to success,\u201d he says.  </p><p>Lee pursued a bachelor degree in science, which he says gave him \u201ca great understanding of the natural world and of the forces and challenges involved in land-use management.\u201d </p><p>He has been heavily involved in environmental initiatives in the past, exploring financial modelling for the independently owned wind industry, leading the reconstruction of Boulder Run on the Oldman River and the Kananaskis Whitewater Centre after the 2013 flood, and advising on reparation to Harvie Passage in Calgary.  </p><p>He is passionate about increasing public access to provincial lands. </p><p>\u201cRetaining the quality of life, environmental protections and land-use character that we now enjoy in the MD of Pincher Creek are just as important, if not more important, than economic development,\u201d Lee says. </p><p>\u201cUnrestrained economic development would threaten the very values that people are looking for now and the values that will be even more important in the future.\u201d </p><p>He is concerned by the environmental impacts of mining, stressing that proposals for coal projects have serious issues that have not been adequately addressed.  </p><p>\u201cThe Crowsnest, Oldman and Livingstone rivers do not have the volume of water to sustain mining operations,\u201d he says. \u201cThe selenium leaching from the overburden waste would threaten our fisheries on the eastern slopes.  </p><p>\u201cThere is also the problem with airborne particulates and coal dust that would be drifting eastward down the valley to the MD. Until all of the issues can be guaranteed as resolved, I remain sceptical on the proposals that have been submitted to date.\u201d </p><p>Lee is an outdoorsman at heart with a passion for watersports. He was executive director of the Alberta Whitewater Association and education and leadership director for Canoe Kayak Canada. He created the Alberta Schools in Pools \u2014 Paddling for Life program and built the National Coaching Certification Program for whitewater kayaking in Canada.  </p><p>Locally, he served as chief organizer and instructor for the Pinch-o-Crow Creekers kayak club and led the Pincher Creek fundraising committee for the multipurpose facility. </p><p>Attaining an MBA taught him about finance, organizational management, marketing, administrative processes, computer system and human resource management. </p><p>\u201cThis gave me a great background for dealing with government, businesses and not-for-profit groups,\u201d he says. </p><p>He worked with the Southwest Alberta Business Development Centre to build its loan portfolio and do microlending in the region. He raised $1 million dollars to rebuild the Kananaskis Whitewater Centre and fundraised $3 million dollars to open the Pincher Creek multipurpose facility. </p><p>The main challenge going forward, he says, is that Pincher Creek\u2019s tax base is not sufficient to sustain the level of services it is offering.  </p><p>\u201cThe town needs to grow and the MD needs to support that population and business growth plan,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe MD needs to support small business growth in its hamlets but also in the rural homes, acreages and ranches.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWith high-speed internet and good communications it is possible to attract good investments to our region because of what we have to offer people that want to relocate from other places.\u201d </p><p>He is also passionate about improving quality of life through health, education and recreation. He says he would focus on retaining quality health care and schools, improving transportation infrastructure and making municipal government more efficient by reducing regulations. </p><p>JOHN MACGARVA </p><p>After a career that has included both government and private industry, wildfire contract work and running his own business, John MacGarva feels it\u2019s his turn to commit his time and experience to the MD council process. </p><p>\u201cI bring practical experience of varied sources to the table,\u201d he says. </p><p>Since the early 1980s, MacGarva has been involved with numerous land-use initiatives. He is a member of the local recreation advisory group and, in the past, worked on the South Saskatchewan Regional Plan. He has also contributed to the early integrated resource plan, forest conservation and special places. </p><p>\u201cMy career as woodlands manager had me responsible for a large annual budget in a very low-margin industry. Running my own small company was a great experience. All the budgets I was involved with had to be balanced budgets,\u201d he says. </p><p>This work also included liaison with government departments and stakeholder groups. </p><p>He would like to start his term in council by introducing himself to Division 5 ratepayers to hear their concerns and thoughts, answer their questions and commit to finding answers. </p><p>MaGarva describes himself as a fiscally responsible man with a hard-working and honest attitude. He plans to advocate for fiscally responsible operations, maintaining fair and affordable taxation and planning for a strong, sustainable future. </p><p>He feels the MD already has strong agricultural, small business and wind energy pursuits and would like to boost local industry through coal mining.   </p><p>\u201cResponsible coal development in Crowsnest will result in strong economic spinoffs for the Pincher area,\u201d he says. \u201cTourism will coexist well with industry.\u201d  </p><p>\u201cThere are valuable deposits of the world's best-quality metallurgical coal to the west of the MD. Much of it on old disturbed mining sites,\u201d he adds. </p><p>\u201cWe have the best provincial environmental standards and enforcement in the world. As a country we need to develop and control our own resources in a responsible manner.\u201d </p><p>MacGarva is president of the Crowsnest Forest Stewardship Society. He coached and managed hockey for 14 years and is former director of Pincher Creek Search and Rescue. </p><p>He would like to see more opportunities for youth in the area and more industries with respect for each other and the environment.  </p><p>Support the democratic process </p><p>A virtual MD candidates forum will be held this Wednesday night, Oct. 6, at 7 p.m. Preregister online to obtain a meeting link and submit questions in advance at bit.ly/3EZzm2T. </p><p>Voting will not take place for divisions 1 and 2, as there is only one candidate for these areas, but voting for the other divisions takes place Monday, Oct. 18, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., at the following locations: </p><p>Division 3: Coalfields School </p><p>Division 4: Summerview Hall at Heritage Acres  </p><p>Division 5: Lundbreck Hall</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3aa16f83ffbf40129975e1f804bddc88</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SV-B141-DY9S-T102-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3210\"/><timeReceived>01:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 6, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

All three local stores were planning, or implementing, improvements including new lines of stock, painting and building, new self-service racks, and greater variety and choice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bourke's was centralizing each department: dry goods, drugs, groceries, produce, frozen foods and hardware.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nelson's had been painting and extending their display and the whole store seemed roomier and airier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearwater General had been busy painting since before the snow began.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Capt. Arthur Dillen, who had just returned from active service with the U.S. Army in Vietnam, was a recent visitor in Vavenby, renewing old acquaintances en route from his parent's home in Smithers to Fort Worth, Texas. Capt. Dillen was a former resident of Clearwater and a 1958 graduate of Clearwater Secondary School.</p><p>On his return to Texas, he would attend school for the instruction of helicopter pilots. For the past year, he had been piloting helicopters in Vietnam. It is hard for us to believe, he said, the sordid conditions under which the people are forces to exist there.</p><p>45 YEARS AGO:</p><p>\"It was unfortunate that a few ruffians had attempted to completely demolish the Flag Pole, which is the key factor in this guess the time contest,\" said and Elks committeeman. \"However, a friend attempted to reset the Flag Pole, but the same ruffians returned a second night to further their cause of destruction.</p><p>\"The Pole is still the indicator of the ice break-up, and the time it falls into the water will set the time of the winning ticket.\"</p><p>A small group of local employers attended Clearwater Secondary School to hear about a program that would involve placing students in work situations with willing employers to stimulate their interest. The program was designed to give senior students an opportunity to decide if they'd be suitable or interested in such positions.</p><p>40 YEARS AGO:</p><p>A car was driven over the bleachers at the Sno Drifters race track and either set on fire or caught on fire, said Clearwater RCMP. A day later a local man reported a 1969 Dodge Sedan missing from the Sunshine Valley area and police later determined this was the vehicle driven over the bleachers.</p><p>Also around the same time, a Birch Island man reported damage to a vehicle that had shots through the radiator and the glass cab.</p><p>A fire of a suspicious nature occurred the same evening at a fruit stand located in the Wells Gray Hotel parking lot. Only minor damage was sustained.</p><p>35 YEARS AGO:</p><p>The forest fire season had officially opened in B.C. and the Ministry of Forests was busy organizing fire suppression forces around the province. Fifteen air tankers and nine bird-dog aircraft would be stationed at air bases, lookouts would be staffed, and ground forces would be placed on alert.</p><p>More intensive use would be made that year of the lightning detection system, which gave early warning signs of possible lightning-caused fires.</p><p>30 YEARS AGO:</p><p>A new multi-purpose building would be constructed at Bear Creek Camp in the summer, according to camp superintendent Dave Gates. The two-story structure would measure 40 feet by 60 feet and would be adjacent to the main building and near the first hut. A hobby room, a finishing room, two large activity rooms, a chapel, and two offices would be housed in the new facility.</p><p>The new building didn't signal any planned increase in the number of inmates at Bear Creek, said Gates. It was intended to better cope with the needs of the present population.</p><p>25 YEARS AGO:</p><p>It could have been much worse.</p><p>That was the key phrase on everyone's lips at the rescue staging area following the derailment of a VIA Rail train south of Blue River.</p><p>\"When it came time to stop, the car was teetering over the river and we all just froze up. I thought, 'This is it &amp; - I'm going to die,'\" said a passenger as she warmed herself by the bonfire in the rescue area that was set up near Berry Creek Forest Service Road.</p><p>All but two of the 13 cars of the westbound rain carrying more than 200 passengers and crew members left the railway tracks.</p><p>20 YEARS AGO:</p><p>A heritage conservation bylaw approved by the Thompson-Nicola Regional District board meant that owners of historically important buildings would be able to have their property designated a heritage site, and thereby receive certain benefits, said Steve Quinn TNRD director for Area B.</p><p>The new bylaw would not mean the TNRD would be able to designate certain buildings as heritage sites against the owner's wishes, he emphasized.</p><p>It would, however, allow the TNRD to work with property owners to protect structures that otherwise might be lost.</p><p>15 YEARS AGO:</p><p>\"At a recent school board meeting, the trustees voted unanimously in favour of recommendations that could make trades training easier in the school district. A committee with members from Thompson Rivers University and the school district would look into how to start the suggested program.</p><p>John Harwood, a local school board trustee, said the proposed program would let students get their high school diploma and a first-year trades certificate from TRU at the same time. The proposed program wasn't just for high school students, he added. Adults would also be able to enroll in it.</p><p>10 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Hard work by B.C. Forest Service firefighters contained a fire in Upper Clearwater to 15 hectares. The fire, which was started by backyard burning, was located about 25 km north of Clearwater near the road to Wells Gray Park.</p><p>An initial attack crew and forest officer responded to the Clearwater Valley Road fire after it was reported to the Kamloops Fire Centre. With the assistance of two air tankers and a bird-dog aircraft, the ground crews were able to successfully contain the fire.</p><p>5 YEARS AGO:</p><p>Clearwater Fire Zone had its first fire callout of the season &amp; - a 1.7 ha blaze on private property next to Dunn Lake Road south of town. Forest protection officer Jim Jones reported he received the call at about 5:30 p.m.</p><p>The call had first gone to e-911, which had called Clearwater Fire Department. However, as the fire was located outside municipal boundaries, the call was transferred to the forest ministry.</p><p>Unfortunately, because it was so early in the season, the fire zone had no initial attack crews on hand so the call went to Clearwater and Blackpool fire departments under their mutual aid agreements, said Jones.</p><p>1 YEAR AGO:</p><p>Central Interior Traffic Services out of Clearwater and other provincial partners had been working together to address an ongoing issue with commercial grain haulers dumping grain on roadside pullouts along Highway 5 between Valemount and Avola.</p><p>The practice had been happening for a few years and caused problems for the environment, wildlife and people driving that stretch of highway. According to RCMP, it was uncertain why it was happening, but one possible reason was to reduce weight before arriving at the commercial weigh scales in Kamloops.</p><p>The BC Conservation Officer Service (BCCOS) was forced to kill a black bear that had become used to hanging around one of the dump sites and was feeding on a pile of grain.</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-4017754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607X-HDD1-JDH1-C1XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1198\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Clearwater Times (N.

Now in his mid-seventies, Andrews spoke with the Hope Standard about his summer spent in near-complete solitude, surviving on canned goods and weathering the elements.</p><p>Looking for a way to finance his undergraduate studies in life sciences at U.B.C., Andrews jumped at the opportunity to earn $250 a month, less the cost of food deducted from his salary as a lookout man. He got on a Greyhound bus to Hope, laden with a 20-kilogram backpack of what he thought he would need for the summer.</p><p>Built in 1953, Hope's forest service lookout was a one-room wooden structure with glass windows and a wrap-around catwalk perched on top of a wooden platform. Inside was an island in the centre with a map and eyesight, to measure the exact area where smoke and fire could be seen, as well as a wood stove and bed too short for Andrews six-foot-four frame.</p><p>Located north of Haig on Highway 1, near what is now American Creek Road, the lookout provided a vista all the way to Flood Hope Road, the road heading to Manning Park and partway up the Fraser Canyon.</p><p>Around 150 such lookouts were active in the 1960s in places with a high forest fire risk or valuable timber, according to a BC Forest Service film. Many have since been torn down, including the Hope lookout.</p><p>At his young age, Andrews was no stranger to life in the great outdoors, having worked on a youth crew the summer before where he earned $3 a day building campgrounds outside of Trail.</p><p>Almost as soon as Andrews arrived, he experienced the wrath of nature. A massive storm shook the tower back and forth and blew out glass windows.</p><p>\"So here I was up there - freezing cold, howling wind, sheets of water, two windows blown out, no dry wood - I look back on this and go I must have been nuts to stay up there,\" Andrews said.</p><p>From windstorms to long summer days, the lookout tower quickly became unbearably hot. For up to 16 hours a day the sun would shine and Andrews would lay on the floor trying to breathe through massive migraines and heat prostration.</p><p>The lookout tower did not have any heat save for a wood stove, light was provided by a Coleman lantern and food was delivered weekly, the majority canned.</p><p>\"I bought cans of everything: butter, ham, fruit, vegetables, peas, corn. If you ordered in fresh milk, as soon as the assistant ranger came you would drink it because basically, it would sour within a day,\" he said.</p><p>All alone, save for one strange visit</p><p>The solitude was also something completely new for Andrews. From April to the first week of September, he had contact with only two people, the first being the assistant ranger's weekly visit. The second was a surprise Andrews remembers to this day.</p><p>As the lookout had no running water, hygiene was quite a challenge. To keep clean, Andrews devised a makeshift showerhead out of a bucket with holes in the bottom. One day, as he stood showering at the bottom of the lookout tower, a man walked out of nowhere.</p><p>\"I'm standing there stark naked with the soap running off me and then he looks at me and says 'Is there any cedar up here?' Of course we're on a bald part of the mountain and I remember saying to him 'No there's no cedar up here.' Then he just walked away,\" Andrews laughed.</p><p>Not all days were as eventful. Andrews spent most of them scouring the hills for smoke and flames, taking temperatures, weighing \"hazard sticks\" to get an idea of how dry the forest was and using a sling psychrometer to measure humidity.</p><p>\"It was amazing how your brain memorized the topography around you. If someone had moved a matchstick I would have noticed it,\" he said.</p><p>Before he began his posting, Andrews heard stories of men whose mental health had deteriorated so much so they had to leave their lookouts for good. A lookout he met in the winter told him to begin speaking with himself, and quick, advice he readily followed.</p><p>\"I would get up in the morning and I'd put my feet over the side of the bed and say \"OK John, what do you have to do today?\". You would say it, so you actually heard a human voice,\" Andrews said.</p><p>Apart from the words he spoke to himself and the public radio he listened to religiously, Andrews would radio a daily report to Vancouver with his lookout call number XMJ93. The experience left him very comfortable being alone.</p><p>He never got the chance to spend time in Hope, but he remembers the town as he got to know it, from above.</p><p>\"It's an odd sensation to be in this situation with a pair of binoculars and I used to stand out on the catwalk sometimes in the evenings and put the binoculars on Hope. I could see these tiny, tiny little people and the cars going up and down, and the lights of the city,\" he said. \"Fascinating watching the city from that far away.\"</p><p>When asked if as a young man he ever felt tempted to abandon the lookout for a weekend of revelry in Hope, Andrews said this would never have been an option. When he was 14, Andrews immigrated from England with only 40 dollars to their name, he would never have done anything to jeopardize his source of income. He also needed a reference from the forest service, which he got, and went on to fight fires the following year.</p><p>Once the first week of September rolled around, Andrews was nevertheless eager to finish his solitary life on top of the bald mountain.</p><p>\"I packed my bag up, I locked the door and I walked out of there with my pack down to Hope. I managed to catch the Greyhound bus to Vancouver,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-3988740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS8-98V1-JDH1-C3PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hope Standard</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Admiralty &amp; Maritime Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzRDNDVDOTdGRUQ1NDE1M0I1RjRBRDFBRTI3ODFGMDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Lookouts &amp; Radar</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDVDMzcwQTQ3RTQ3NEYwNzgyODA3MzQ1RTNCMTQxMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFGMjU3NzFFQ0JDNDJDQkI1OThEREE1RTUxMzk4QzM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U6V</classCode><className>BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's bigger than the Superbowl. It's like government and the public health establishment is all of a sudden on steroids, or to employ a more appropriate metaphor, on speed. Despite the weak leadership of the White House, despite the chaos and confusion in some countries, it shows what can happen when there is the political will and public support to end an epidemic as quickly as possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fifty billion dollars from the IMF. Eight billion from Congress. Interest rates cut. School closures and mass quarantines. Citizens have mobilized and cleared out the shelves at every pharmacy and supermarket of hand sanitizer and wipes promising to kill 99.9% of viruses and bacteria. Families are stocking up on food and medication. Theresa Tam, Canada's top public health official, is (almost) a household name.</p><p>It took 20 years and pitched battles against Big Pharma, the medical establishment and law enforcement to mobilize against the rising toll of overdose deaths. Even now, the struggle for resources to fight the opioid epidemic continues. On March 5, in what many saw as a prelude to cuts in harm reduction services, the government of Alberta released a report largely critical of the province's $18 million investment in supervised consumption sites.</p><p>When I looked into the history of the opioid epidemic, I saw the contagious spread of addictive medications and the deadly consequences of their overuse; I also see the spread of dangerous ideas about how to achieve euphoria and freedom from pain. Comparing the spread of an infectious disease like COVID-19 with the spread of an addictive drug may seem foolhardy, but let's give it a try.</p><p>For one thing, the COVID-19 narrative is so much simpler than the opioid epidemic ever was. Humanity against the virus. It's that simple. The opioid epidemic was and is so much more complicated; first there was pain, then there were new, \"non-addictive opioids\" brought to us by glamorous and convincing drug reps, then there was a rising tide of addiction, emergency room visits for overdoses, infections from dirty needles and then the death toll began to rise. Opioids were our salvation and our curse. Addiction to OxyContin was unheard of, until it was everywhere.</p><p>For another thing, the world was anticipating an infectious disease outbreak, especially after so many near-misses and false alarms. The public health infrastructure of the world is a loaded gun ready to shoot down any new infectious plague, although this particular gun is wielded by politicians who, in a few countries, may have skipped out on target practice. Nonetheless, every COVID-19 case is played out in the light of constant media coverage, no one is safe and so everyone is ready to play their part against the virus. When the stock market crashes, it's easy to remember the importance of investing in public health.</p><p>By contrast, almost no one was expecting the opioid epidemic, and even fewer people were expecting the degree to which fentanyl would poison North America's drug supply. The overdose rate kept climbing to higher and previously unimaginable levels. Addiction was only supposed to happen to so-called \"junkies,\" \"druggies\" and the homeless, until your own son or daughter was one of them, or your brother, or you were the one holding the needle filled to the tip with street fentanyl. Addiction treatment was relegated to treating patients who hid their medication just as they had hidden their drugs.</p><p>Even worse, just when COVID-19 rudely entered our new decade, we were celebrating the first reduction in overdose death rates since the 1990s. We thought we were making some progress against fentanyl.  Now we have to ask ourselves if government, our health infrastructure and the public can sustain the level of intensity we have seen against COVID-19 while simultaneously fighting the opioid epidemic. To a certain extent, we have to choose. It is zero-sum. There are only so many health-care dollars, hours of media coverage and tweets to go around. It looks like Alberta might be the first province to falter.</p><p>Put your mind back to the 1980s for a moment because the HIV epidemic provides a useful contrast to both opioids and COVID-19. HIV began as a few cases in the jungle, then transformed into a global pandemic. If you think people are afraid of coronavirus, they were really afraid of AIDS.</p><p>Fear, stigma, hysteria and moral panic characterized our relationship with HIV in the 1980s and 1990s. A photo from June 1983 shows a group of men marching with a banner that reads \"AIDS: We need research. Not hysteria.\"</p><p>Although HIV is still with us, we have contained the epidemic. Research has replaced hysteria and advocacy has supplanted ignorance. Scientists, clinicians and communities made great strides forward. Public health workers tried a succession of strategies to stop the epidemic. At first there was only ABC - Abstinence, Be Faithful, Use Condoms. Life-saving medications were introduced in the mid-1990s. Access to sterile needles and addiction supports were added to the mix. Governments loosened the pursestrings and funded global antiretroviral programs. Early treatment was shown to reduce transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis was added, public awareness campaigns, the Internet; everything was mobilized. We haven't beaten HIV but we have been relentless, and we have stacked victory upon victory.</p><p>Ending COVID-19 may be simpler: wash your hands and get vaccinated. Or maybe the vaccine will come too late, after every susceptible person has already been infected. In the meantime, we are throwing everything at it - hand sanitizer, billions of dollars, rate cuts, quarantines, travel bans, N-95 masks.</p><p>Ending the opioid epidemic will be more complex. To a certain extent we know what policies reduce overdoses and the harms of drug use. Some can be changed by a politician's pen, some will take years and a shift in culture and attitudes, while others will require major redistribution of wealth and changes to the social safety net.</p><p>It will take time and sustained investments in research, new technology, new treatments, new models of care. It's too soon to tell if government, the media, researchers and the public have the stamina to keep fighting fentanyl day after day for years to come, but I have a feeling that after COVID-19 has burned through every country on earth like a forest fire we will wake up and realize that fentanyl is still with us.</p><p>Because the opioid epidemic is more complex than COVID-19 and because it has festered in society for so much longer, it will be much more complicated to fix. In a world facing the twin epidemics of fentanyl and COVID-19, it is more important than ever that we take stock of the weapons we have to combat addiction and disease and build a resilient public health and primary-care system for the challenges of the moment, and the challenges to come. This is not the time to falter.</p><p>Brodie Ramin is an addictions physician and an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. He is the author of \"The Age of Fentanyl,\" which is released this month.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020031557508065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF3-HTH1-JDH1-C15R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

A photo from June 1983 shows a group of men marching with a banner that reads \"AIDS: We need research. Not hysteria.\"</p><p>Although HIV is still with us, we have contained the epidemic. Research has replaced hysteria and advocacy has supplanted ignorance. Scientists, clinicians and communities made great strides forward. Public health workers tried a succession of strategies to stop the epidemic. At first there was only ABC - Abstinence, Be Faithful, Use Condoms. Life-saving medications were introduced in the mid-1990s. Access to sterile needles and addiction supports were added to the mix. Governments loosened the pursestrings and funded global antiretroviral programs. Early treatment was shown to reduce transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis was added, public awareness campaigns, the internet; everything was mobilized. We haven't beaten HIV but we have been relentless, and we have stacked victory upon victory.</p><p>Ending COVID-19 may be simpler: wash your hands and get vaccinated. Or maybe the vaccine will come too late, after every susceptible person has already been infected. In the meantime, we are throwing everything at it - hand sanitizer, billions of dollars, rate cuts, quarantines, travel bans, N-95 masks.</p><p>Ending the opioid epidemic will be more complex. To a certain extent we know what policies reduce overdoses and the harms of drug use. Some can be changed by a politician's pen, some will take years and a shift in culture and attitudes, while others will require major redistribution of wealth and changes to the social safety net.</p><p>It will take time and sustained investments in research, new technology, new treatments, new models of care. It's too soon to tell if government, the media, researchers and the public have the stamina to keep fighting fentanyl day after day for years to come, but I have a feeling that after COVID-19 has burned through every country on earth like a forest fire we will wake up and realize that fentanyl is still with us.</p><p>Because the opioid epidemic is more complex than COVID-19 and because it has festered in society for so much longer, it will be much more complicated to fix. In a world facing the twin epidemics of fentanyl and COVID-19, it is more important than ever that we take stock of the weapons we have to combat addiction and disease and build a resilient public health and primary-care system for the challenges of the moment, and the challenges to come. This is not the time to falter.</p><p>Brodie Ramin is an addictions physician and an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa.

We are taking the steps we believe are necessary, including investing in digital and automation technologies, to support the restart of our tier-one assets to create a more flexible asset base that will allow us to align our production decisions with our contract portfolio commitments and opportunities, allow us to eliminate the care and maintenance costs incurred while our tier-one production is suspended, and to benefit from the very favourable life-of-mine economics our tier-one assets provide.</p><p>\"Despite the near-term costs of our strategy and associated with the precautionary production suspensions at Cigar Lake, we have a strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion dollars in cash. We also successfully added an additional 7 million pounds U</p><p>\"We are excited about the future of nuclear power generation, about the fundamentals of uranium supply and demand and about the prospects for our company and remain committed to our tier-one strategy and to our vision. Globally, we see demand for both traditional and non-traditional uses of nuclear power growing as the increasing focus on electrification while phasing out carbon intensive sources of energy continues to take hold.</p><p>\"Our vision to energize a clean-air world recognizes that we have an important role to play in enabling the vast reductions in greenhouse gas emissions required to accomplish the targets being set by countries and companies around the world to achieve a resilient, net-zero carbon economy. We are vertically integrated across the nuclear fuel cycle. Our uranium and fuel services products are used around the world in the generation of safe, carbon-free, affordable, base-load nuclear energy. In addition, we are exploring other emerging and non-traditional opportunities within the fuel cycle, which align well with our commitment to responsibly and sustainably manage our business and increase our contributions to global climate change solutions, such as our investment in Global Laser Enrichment LLC and the memorandum of understanding signed with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy and Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas to explore several areas of cooperation to advance the commercialization and deployment of BWRX-300 small modular reactors in Canada and around the world.</p><p>\"We believe we have the right strategy to achieve our vision and we will do so in a manner that reflects our values. For over 30 years, we have been delivering our products responsibly. Sustainability is at the heart of what we do. Embedded in all our decisions is a commitment to addressing the environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities that we believe will make our business sustainable over the long term.\"</p><p>* Q2 net loss of $37 million; Q2 adjusted net loss of $38 million: Results are driven by normal quarterly variations in contract deliveries and our continued execution of our strategy. This quarter was also impacted by additional care and maintenance costs of $8 million resulting from the proactive suspension of production at the Cigar Lake mine for about four months until its restart in mid-April. While production was suspended, we kept and continued to pay all our employees. These costs were offset by the receipt of $9 million from the Canadian Employment Wage Subsidy for the quarter. Adjusted net earnings is a non-IFRS measure, see below.</p><p>* Cigar Lake restarted and 2021 outlook updated: We safely resumed production at Cigar Lake following the evacuation of non-essential personnel at the beginning of July due to the proximity of a forest fire. We expect to produce up to 12 million pounds on a 100% basis in 2021, provided there are no further disruptions due to COVID-19, forest fires or any other cause. We have updated our 2021 consolidated outlook, including for our uranium segment. See Outlook for 2021 in our second quarter MD&amp;A.</p><p>* Contracting continues: In addition to the 9 million pounds U</p><p>* Strong balance sheet: As of June 30, 2021, we had $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.0 billion in long-term debt. In addition, we have a $1 billion undrawn credit facility. We expect our cash balances and operating cash flows to meet our capital requirements during 2021, therefore, we do not anticipate drawing on our credit facility this year.</p><p>* Clean-energy innovation: On July 7, 2021, we announced we signed a memorandum of understanding with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy and Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas to explore several areas of cooperation to advance the commercialization and deployment of BWRX-300 small modular reactors in Canada and around the world. //st Consolidated financial results</p><p>THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS ENDED JUNE 30 ENDED JUNE 30 ($ MILLIONS EXCEPT 2021 2020 CHANGE 2021 2020 CHANGE WHERE INDICATED) Revenue 359 525 (32 )% 649 871 (25 )% Gross profit (loss) 12 (14 ) )100% (28 ) 21 )(100)% Net losses attributable (37 ) (53 ) 30 % (42 ) (72 ) 42 % to equity holders</p><p>$ per (0.09 ) (0.13 ) 29 % (0.10 ) (0.18 ) 44 %</p><p>common</p><p>share</p><p>(basic)</p><p>$ per (0.09 ) (0.13 ) 29 % (0.10 ) (0.18 ) 44 %</p><p>common</p><p>share</p><p>(diluted) Adjusted net losses (38 ) (65 ) 42 % (67 ) (36 ) (86 )% (non-IFRS, see below)</p><p>$ per (0.10 ) (0.16 ) 38 % (0.17 ) (0.09 ) (89 )%</p><p>common</p><p>share</p><p>(adjusted</p><p>and</p><p>diluted) Cash provided by (used 152 (316 ) )100 % 197 (134 ) )100 % in) operations (after working capital changes) The financial information presented for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2021 is unaudited.

We use this measure as a meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings is our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period and has also been adjusted for reclamation provisions for our Rabbit Lake and US operations, which had been impaired, and income taxes on adjustments.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings is non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies.</p><p>The following table reconciles adjusted net earnings with net earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and compares it to the same periods in 2020. //st</p><p>THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS</p><p>ENDED JUNE 30 ENDED JUNE 30 ($ MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net losses attributable (37 ) (53 ) (42 ) (72 ) to equity holders Adjustments</p><p>Adjustments (9 ) (41 ) (18 ) 29</p><p>on</p><p>derivatives</p><p>Reclamation 6 23 (16 ) 17</p><p>provision</p><p>adjustments</p><p>Income 2 6 9 (10 )</p><p>taxes on</p><p>adjustments Adjusted net losses (38 ) (65 ) (67 ) (36 )</p><p>Every quarter we are required to update the reclamation provisions for all operations based on new cash flow estimates, discount and inflation rates. This normally results in an adjustment to an asset retirement obligation asset in addition to the provision balance. When the assets of an operation have been written off due to an impairment, as is the case with our Rabbit Lake and US ISR operations, the adjustment is recorded directly to the statement of earnings as \"other operating expense (income)\". See note 8 of our interim financial statements for more information. This amount has been excluded from our adjusted net earnings measure.</p><p>Selected segmented highlights //st</p><p>THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS</p><p>ENDED JUNE 30 ENDED JUNE 30 HIGHLIGHTS 2021 2020 CHANGE 2021 2020 CHANGE Uranium Production 1.3 - n/a 1.3 2.1 (38 )%</p><p>volume</p><p>(million</p><p>lbs)</p><p>Sales 6.0 9.2 (35 )% 11.0 15.2 (28 )%</p><p>volume</p><p>(million</p><p>lbs)</p><p>Average ($US/lb) 33.56 32.99 2 % 32.97 32.36 2 %</p><p>realized</p><p>price</p><p>($Cdn/lb) 41.70 46.13 (10 )% 41.41 44.28 (6 )%</p><p>Revenue 252 426 (41 )% 457 674 (32 )%</p><p>($</p><p>millions)</p><p>Gross (26 ) (34 ) 24 % (91 ) (29 ) )(100)%</p><p>loss ($</p><p>millions) Fuel Production 3.6 2.7 33 % 7.6 6.4 19 % services volume</p><p>(million</p><p>kgU)</p><p>Sales 3.1 3.2 (3 )% 5.7 6.3 (10 )%</p><p>volume</p><p>(million</p><p>kgU)</p><p>Average ($Cdn/kgU) 32.57 28.95 13 % 32.26 29.43 10 %</p><p>realized</p><p>price</p><p>Revenue 100 92 9 % 184 186 (1 )%</p><p>($</p><p>millions)</p><p>Gross 36 24 50 % 63 53 19 %</p><p>profit ($</p><p>millions)</p><p>Management's discussion and analysis and financial statements</p><p>The second quarter MD&amp;A and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements provide a detailed explanation of our operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the same periods last year.

But authorities know from experience that the biggest risks will come with repeated rains over many months or years while the damaged watersheds, or catchment areas, recover.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And because of the size and intensity of the fires, the potential impacts are not clear yet.</p><p>\"The forest area burned in Australia within a single fire season is just staggering,\" said Stefan Doerr, a professor at Swansea University in Wales who studies the effects of forest fires on sediment and ash runoff. \"We haven't seen anything like it in recorded history.\"</p><p>The situation in Australia illustrates a growing global concern: Forests, grasslands and other areas that supply drinking water to hundreds of millions of people are increasingly vulnerable to fire due in large part to hotter, drier weather that has extended fire seasons, and more people moving into those areas, where they can accidentally set fires.</p><p>More than 60% of the water supply for the world's 100 largest cities originates in fire-prone watersheds - and countless smaller communities also rely on surface water in vulnerable areas, researchers say.</p><p>When rain does fall, it can be intense, dumping a lot of water in a short period of time, which can quickly erode denuded slopes and wash huge volumes of ash, sediment and debris into crucial waterways and reservoirs. Besides reducing the amount of water available, the runoff also can introduce pollutants, as well as nutrients that create algae blooms.</p><p>What's more, the area that burns each year in many forest ecosystems has increased in recent decades, and that expansion likely will continue through the century because of a warmer climate, experts say.</p><p>Most of the more than 25,000 square miles (64,000 square kilometres) that have burned in Victoria and New South Wales have been forest, including rainforests, according to scientists in New South Wales and the Victorian government. Some believe that high temperatures, drought and more frequent fires may make it impossible for some areas to be fully restored.</p><p>Very hot fires burn organic matter and topsoil needed for trees and other vegetation to regenerate, leaving nothing to absorb water. The heat also can seal and harden the ground, causing water to run off quickly, carrying everything in its path.</p><p>That in turn can clog streams, killing fish, plants and other aquatic life necessary for high-quality water before it reaches reservoirs. Already, thunderstorms in southeast Australia in recent weeks have caused debris flows and fish kills in some rivers, though fires continue to burn.</p><p>\"You potentially get this feedback cycle,\" where vegetation can't recolonize an area, which intensifies erosion of any remaining soil, said Joel Sankey, research geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey</p><p>The role of climate change is often difficult to pin down in specific wildfires, said Gary Sheridan, a researcher at the University of Melbourne. But he said the drying effects of wildfire - combined with hotter weather and less rainfall in much of Australia, even as more rain falls in the northern part of the country - mean that \"we should expect more fires.\"</p><p>But climate change has affected areas such as Alaska and northern Canada, where average annual temperatures have risen by about 4 degrees (2.2 degrees Celsius) since the 1960s compared with 1.6 degrees (0.88 degrees Celsius) globally. As a result, the forested area burned annually has more than doubled over the past 20 to 30 years, said Doerr, from Swansea University.</p><p>Although there might be fewer cities and towns in the path of runoff in those areas, problems do occur. In Canada's Fort McMurray, Alberta, the cost of treating ash-tainted water in its drinking-water system increased dramatically after a 2016 wildfire.</p><p>In the Western U.S., 65% of all surface water supplies originate in forested watersheds where the risk of wildfires is growing - including in the historically wet Pacific Northwest. By mid-century almost 90% of them will experience an increase - doubling in some - in post-fire sedimentation that could affect drinking water supplies, according to a federally funded 2017 study.</p><p>\"The results are striking and alarming,\" said Sankey, the USGS geologist, who helped lead the study. \"But a lot of communities are working to address these issues,\" he added. \"It's not all doom and gloom because there are a lot of opportunities to reduce risks.\"</p><p>Denver Water, which serves 1.4 million customers, discovered \"the high cost of being reactive\" after ash and sediment runoff from two large, high-intensity fires, in 1996 and 2002, clogged a reservoir that handles 80% of the water for its 1.4 million customers, said Christina Burri, a watershed scientist for the utility.</p><p>It spent about $28 million to recover, mostly to dredge 1 million cubic yards (765,555 cubic meters) of sediment from the reservoir.</p><p>Since then, the utility has spent tens of millions more to protect the forests, partnering with the U.S. Forest Service and others to protect the watershed and proactively battle future fires, including by clearing some trees and controlling vegetation in populated areas.</p><p>Utilities also can treat slopes with wood chips and other cover and install barriers to slow ash runoff. They purposely burn vegetation when fire danger is low to get rid of undergrowth.</p><p>Canberra's water utility has built in redundancies in case of fire, such as collecting water from three watersheds instead of two, and it can switch among sources if necessary, said Kristy Wilson, a spokeswoman for Icon Water, which operates the system.

(TSXV: AL) (FSE: 6LLN) (OTC: ALXEF) (\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that a follow-up prospecting and sampling program is underway at its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,069 hectares (24,880 acres) staked within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt and is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario. </p><p>Highlights of the 2020 Vixen North Exploration ProgramALX's initial 2020 prospecting program was halted by a major forest fire in August 2020 - however, in their time on the ground ALX geologists were able to identify important geological trends at Vixen North that indicate the presence of iron formation-hosted gold occurrences (see ALX news release dated September 9, 2020[1]). The Company highlights the following for its newly-interpreted Vulpin Zone at Vixen North (click on map below): A high-resolution airborne survey is underway and to date has collected preliminary data defining an approximate 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend in conjunction with the Vulpin Zone;VLF-EM conductivity data from the current survey shows an electromagnetic (\"EM\") anomaly coincident with the high magnetic feature;ALX geologists plan to traverse the Vulpin Zone with Beep Mats manufactured by Instrumentation GDD Inc., which are portable electromagnetic sensing devices that can locate concealed EM conductors close to surface; Up to 200 additional samples may be collected along the iron formation associated gold mineralization found in August 2020, where previous samples ranged up to 8.41 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold; Other prospecting targets include detailed follow-up of gold mineralization found within a fluorite occurrence southwest of the Vulpin Zone that may represent a genetic phase of porphyry-hosted gold deposition. <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/65490_figure1.jpgFigure\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/65490_figure1.jpgFigure</url> 1To view an enhanced version of Figure 1, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/65490_figure1.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/65490_figure1.jpg</url>[2] Click here[3] to view maps and photos of the Vixen Gold Project.About ALX's Exploration at Vixen After a successful reconnaissance sampling program at Vixen in late 2019, where ALX collected rock samples ranging up to 23.9 g/t gold (0.765 oz/ton) (see ALX news release and photos dated December 12, 2019[4]), ALX carried out a follow-up helicopter-supported, prospecting and sampling program in early August 2020 (the \"2020 Program\"). Rock samples collected in 2020 at Vixen North ranged up to 8.41 g/t gold, with two of three samples collected in a newly-recognized mineralized zone located in the central part of the property named the Vulpin Zone returning gold values greater than 1.0 g/t. Historical sampling also found significant gold values: Vixen Gold Project - Vulpin Zone, 2019-2020 and Historical Gold Results greater than 1.0 g/t Gold During the 2020 Program, gold occurrences were found within gossanous and magnetite-bearing host rocks, leading to the possibility of banded iron formation (\"BIF\") gold deposits at Vixen, a gold deposit model which has not been historically sought after in the Vixen area. However, the Springpole Gold deposit1 (owned by First Mining Gold Corp.) located six kilometres to the south of Vixen North demonstrates the influence of NNW-trending BIF for hosting gold mineralization confirmed by both surface mapping and the detection of strong magnetic high anomalies observed in a 2004 aeromagnetic survey2. At Springpole, strong evidence exists that gold and associated fluorite mineralization is genetically related to the high-level emplacement of a large, alkaline porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex (\"APB\")3. ALX is currently reviewing the interpreted iron formation and fluorite occurrences at Vixen North to evaluate the presence of an APB gold mineralization model at the Project.1 Springpole contains a reported Indicated mineral resource estimate of 139.1 million tonnes at 1.04 g/t gold and 5.4 g/t silver, containing 4.67 million ounces of gold and 24.19 million ounces of silver, and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 11.4 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t gold and 3.1 g/t silver, containing 230,000 ounces of gold and 1.12 million ounces of silver (Source: First Mining Gold Corp., 2020).2 Preliminary Economic Assessment Update for the Springpole Gold Project, Ontario, Canada, prepared for First Mining Gold Corp. by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., November 2019.3 Technical report on the Springpole Lake Property, Red Make Mining Division, NW Ontario, for Gold Canyon Resources Inc., (Zabey, 2002).About Vixen and the Red Lake Mining DistrictTo date, the Red Lake Mining District (\"Red Lake\") has produced over 28 million ounces of gold since mines began production in 1925 (readers are cautioned that mineralization present on adjacent properties may not be present at Vixen). Historic gold mines in the Red Lake camp include the Campbell mine, the Red Lake mine, and the Couchenour-Williams mine, all multi-million ounce gold producers. Vixen lies within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt, a geological trend located to the northeast of Red Lake that hosts numerous historical gold mines and showings and is highly-prospective for new showings of gold mineralization. The Argosy Mine, located approximately 2.0 kilometres from the Vixen North claim boundary, produced approximately 102,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1952. The Springpole Gold Project, operated by First Mining Gold Corp., is located approximately 6.0 kilometres from the Vixen North boundary.ALX considers Vixen historically underexplored where areas of limited outcrop have inhibited surface exploration and plans to identify new drill targets through detailed prospecting, leading-edge geochemical techniques, and geophysical surveys. National Instrument 43-101 DisclosureThe technical information in this news release was reviewed and approved by Sierd Eriks, P. Geo., President and Chief Geologist of the Company, who is a Qualified Person in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101.

(\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that a follow-up prospecting and sampling program is underway at its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,069 hectares (24,880 acres) staked within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt and is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights of the 2020 Vixen North Exploration Program</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALX's initial 2020 prospecting program was halted by a major forest fire in August 2020 - however, in their time on the ground ALX geologists were able to identify important geological trends at Vixen North that indicate the presence of iron formation-hosted gold occurrences (see ALX news release dated September 9, 2020).</p><p>The Company highlights the following for its newly-interpreted Vulpin Zone at Vixen North (click on map below): //st * A high-resolution airborne survey is underway and to date has collected preliminary data defining an approximate 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend in conjunction with the Vulpin Zone; * VLF-EM conductivity data from the current survey shows an electromagnetic (\"EM\") anomaly coincident with the high magnetic feature; * ALX geologists plan to traverse the Vulpin Zone with Beep Mats manufactured by Instrumentation GDD Inc., which are portable electromagnetic sensing devices that can locate concealed EM conductors close to surface; * Up to 200 additional samples may be collected along the iron formation associated gold mineralization found in August 2020, where previous samples ranged up to 8.41 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold; * Other prospecting targets include detailed follow-up of gold mineralization found within a fluorite occurrence southwest of the Vulpin Zone that may represent a genetic phase of porphyry-hosted gold deposition.

Rock samples collected in 2020 at Vixen North ranged up to 8.41 g/t gold, with two of three samples collected in a newly-recognized mineralized zone located in the central part of the property named the Vulpin Zone returning gold values greater than 1.0 g/t. Historical sampling also found significant gold values:</p><p>Vixen Gold Project - Vulpin Zone, 2019-2020 and Historical Gold Results greater than 1.0 g/t Gold //st Sample Year Vixen North Sample Gold Silver Number Location (grams/tonne) (grams/tonne) 75927 2020 Vulpin Zone 2.05 0.9 75951 2020 Vulpin Zone 8.41 1.5 75963 2020 1.4 km east of 1.50 -</p><p>Vulpin Zone 295572 2019 Vulpin Zone 5.93 1.3 295565 2019 Magnetite-Fluorite 1.47 0.9</p><p>Showing 64969 2002 Vulpin Zone 22.73 2.2 64972 2002 Vulpin Zone 5.88 0.2 64968 2002 Vulpin Zone 1.74 87JG-199 1987 Vulpin Zone 5.49 -</p><p>During the 2020 Program, gold occurrences were found within gossanous and magnetite-bearing host rocks, leading to the possibility of banded iron formation (\"BIF\") gold deposits at Vixen, a gold deposit model which has not been historically sought after in the Vixen area. However, the Springpole Gold deposit1 (owned by First Mining Gold Corp.) located six kilometres to the south of Vixen North demonstrates the influence of NNW-trending BIF for hosting gold mineralization confirmed by both surface mapping and the detection of strong magnetic high anomalies observed in a 2004 aeromagnetic survey2. At Springpole, strong evidence exists that gold and associated fluorite mineralization is genetically related to the high-level emplacement of a large, alkaline porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex (\"APB\")3. ALX is currently reviewing the interpreted iron formation and fluorite occurrences at Vixen North to evaluate the presence of an APB gold mineralization model at the Project.</p><p>1 Springpole contains a reported Indicated mineral resource estimate of 139.1 million tonnes at 1.04 g/t gold and 5.4 g/t silver, containing 4.67 million ounces of gold and 24.19 million ounces of silver, and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 11.4 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t gold and 3.1 g/t silver, containing 230,000 ounces of gold and 1.12 million ounces of silver (Source: First Mining Gold Corp., 2020).</p><p>2 Preliminary Economic Assessment Update for the Springpole Gold Project, Ontario, Canada, prepared for First Mining Gold Corp. by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., November 2019.</p><p>3 Technical report on the Springpole Lake Property, Red Make Mining Division, NW Ontario, for Gold Canyon Resources Inc., (Zabey, 2002).</p><p>About Vixen and the Red Lake Mining District</p><p>To date, the Red Lake Mining District (\"Red Lake\") has produced over 28 million ounces of gold since mines began production in 1925 (readers are cautioned that mineralization present on adjacent properties may not be present at Vixen). Historic gold mines in the Red Lake camp include the Campbell mine, the Red Lake mine, and the Couchenour-Williams mine, all multi-million ounce gold producers. Vixen lies within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt, a geological trend located to the northeast of Red Lake that hosts numerous historical gold mines and showings and is highly-prospective for new showings of gold mineralization. The Argosy Mine, located approximately 2.0 kilometres from the Vixen North claim boundary, produced approximately 102,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1952. The Springpole Gold Project, operated by First Mining Gold Corp., is located approximately 6.0 kilometres from the Vixen North boundary.</p><p>ALX considers Vixen historically underexplored where areas of limited outcrop have inhibited surface exploration and plans to identify new drill targets through detailed prospecting, leading-edge geochemical techniques, and geophysical surveys.</p><p>National Instrument 43-101 Disclosure</p><p>The technical information in this news release was reviewed and approved by Sierd Eriks, P.

To advance exploration Adamera put significant efforts into finding a partner for the Cooke Mountain project, an initiative that led to the January 2020 announcement of the JV with Hochschild. Their interest is primarily to follow up on targets that have returned high-grade drilling results. Adamera is acting as the operator of the JV. See news release dated January 22, 2020.)</p><p>In early 2020 at Cooke Mountain, under the JV the Company successfully: //st 1)Completed detailed mapping at Lamefoot South. 2)Completed deep induced polarization (IP) surveying at Oversight, Lamefoot South and Goodfoot properties. All of the targets are in close proximity to previous mines. 3)Developed high-priority drill targets at Lamefoot South, Goodfoot and Oversight properties for 2021 drilling. 4)Increased the land position at Cooke Mountain by staking Iron Mountain (~3000 acres) 5)Completed geological mapping and prospecting on the Iron Mountain property.</p><p>On the Adamera 100% owned projects the Company successfully: //st 1)Completed Staking the Buckhorn 2.0 property. 2)Conducted geological mapping and prospecting on select areas of the property. 3)Identified targets at the Magnetic Mine prospect on the Buckhorn 2.0 project and submitted a plan of operation for 2021 drilling. 4)Identified targets at the Keystone prospect on the Buckhorn 2.0 project and submitted a plan of operation for 2021 drilling. 5)Identified large high priority areas on the property for immediate ground geophysical and geochemical surveying.</p><p>PRE-COVID WORK IN 2020 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/c\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/c</url></p><p>Click Image To View Full SizeCooke Mountain Staking</p><p>As part of the Cooke Mountain Agreement, Hochschild and Adamera expanded the Cooke Mountain project to the south by staking the Iron Mountain property prior to closures related to Covid-19. A total of 182 claims were staked, 129 of which are related to the new Iron Mountain claim block. (See news release dated March 11, 2020.)</p><p>Program Planning and Marketing</p><p>In Q1 2020 Adamera began planning a program on the Cooke Mountain project which included deep penetrating IP surveying to further define our known targets. In addition, the Company focused on marketing the new JV, funding and attending conferences. Interviews with Eric Coffin and Greg McCoach were also conducted with positive responses. In early March, shortly after returning from the PDAC and metals investor forums in Toronto, COVID-19 shutdowns ensued. Field programs and operational procedures changed dramatically. (Click here to watch videos.)</p><p>WORK DURING COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS</p><p>During March, April and May Adamera closed its Vancouver office and shutdown all work programs in Washington state. During this shutdown the Company continued to work on data analysis and initiated plans to acquire land around the Buckhorn gold mine.</p><p>Buckhorn Project Acquisition</p><p>For some time Adamera has been collating information on the Buckhorn mine area to ascertain how much exploration had been conducted outside of the immediate mine area. Based on historical information it appears that Kinross had developed more than 100 targets on the claim block that were not drill tested. Furthermore, they had applied for permits to drill 950 holes from 675 drill pads and construct 120 kms of road to access the drill pads. The size and complexity of process stalled timely progress and the company subsequently dropped the bulk of the original land package to focus entirely on the mine site. The regional potential was determined by Adamera to be highly prospective and largely untested by drilling.</p><p>In early June, the State of Washington reduced COVID-19 restrictions, allowing Adamera to assemble a staking crew. On June 8, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a private agreement to lease 38 claims on Buckhorn Mountain. This transaction was followed by a large staking campaign, the Buckhorn 2.0 project. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/</url></p><p>Click Image To View Full Size</p><p>A total of 339 claims were staked over three weeks in June to surround the Crown Resources/Kinross patented claims on which the Buckhorn Mine is situated. With the addition of state leases, the Buckhorn 2.0 project now comprises 9100 acres of federal and state land. The property staked by Adamera covers much of the lands that originally constituted the Buckhorn project. (See news release dated July 22, 2020.)</p><p>A large portion of the land in the Buckhorn 2.0 claim block is US Forest Service (USFS) land previously managed by Okanagan Forest District. On October 1, 2020 the USFS transferred the Buckhorn lands from Okanagan Forest District to the Colville Forest District which typically manages lands with similar physiographic and ecological character. The Colville Forest District is responsible for the lands in the Republic mining district and is well familiar with the objectives of primary producers in the area. This is a significant and positive development for Adamera and the district.</p><p>Geological Mapping - Buckhorn 2.0 Claims</p><p>The crew that completed prospecting and geological mapping at Iron Mountain in mid June, began prospecting and geological mapping on the new Buckhorn 2.0 claims in July. This work identified several prospects including the Magnetic Mine for follow up exploration. Late in 2020, historic drill data from within the Buckhorn 2.0 claim block highlighted a drill intercept with 9 g/t gold over 7.5 metres. According to Adameras 2020 geological mapping, the drill intercept is located 1.5 kilometres south of Kinross Buckhorn Mine and within the same geological block. Adamera has prepared two separate Plan of Operations on the claim block for anticipated drilling in 2021. (See news release dated December 1, 2020.)</p><p>Geological Mapping - Iron Mountain Claims at Cooke Mountain and Lamefoot South</p><p>As staking was being carried out on the Adamera 100% owned Buckhorn 2.0 project, the JV at Cooke Mountain initiated prospecting and geological mapping of the new Iron Mountain claims. This work identified numerous historic workings and areas with elevated to highly anomalous gold values. One site yielded a grab sample with up to 18.6 g/t gold, confirming that prospective geology extends south onto the Iron Mountain claims despite the very limited outcrop exposure in the area. With so little outcrop traditional prospecting would have had little chance of success. Evaluation of this project will rely on the detailed soil geochemical and geophysical methods routinely employed by Adamera. (See news release dated October, 20, 2020.)</p><p>Before the end of the field season, the geological crew completed a detailed map of the Lamefoot South Property, immediately south of the high-grade Lamefoot gold mine. This work better located key lithological contacts that will greatly assist in target development and interpretation of the 2020 IP data.</p><p>IP surveying Cooke Mountain Project <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/ec\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/ec</url></p><p>Click Image To View Full Size</p><p>Hochschild Mining Site Visit</p><p>In late June the Company assembled a separate crew to conduct the deep penetrating IP on the Cooke Mountain JV project. A total of 34-line kilometres of IP surveying was completed on the Oversight, Goodfoot and Lamefoot South target areas. The survey operated from July through to mid October and suffered several delays due to the fire threat. In early September, the Washington State imposed fire restrictions requiring work to cease by 1pm each day and by September 20 all IP surveying was completely shut down until the end of the month.</p><p>The IP data is currently being interpreted. Inversion modelling is taking longer to complete than expected but the data resolutions are better than anticipated. Preliminary inversion data has been received on the Goodfoot and Lamefoot South properties. The surveys appear to penetrate to depths greater than 200 metres and better define the same targets that had appeared in previous Adamera data. (See news release dated November 10, 2020.)</p><p>In November of 2020, Hochschild management visited the Cooke Mountain JV project. During the site visit the exploration targets and drilling plans for 2021 were discussed.</p><p>BOARD AND COMPANY ADVISOR APPOINTMENTS</p><p>In concert with the exploration activity by Adamera, the Company strengthened its Board by appointing Mark Jones and Alejandro Adams as directors and Peter Cooper and Graeme Curie as advisors.</p><p>Mr. Jones has over 40 years of management and board experience in the resource sector, including his highly valued leadership of Crown Resources. Crown discovered the very high-grade Crown Jewel gold deposit in northeastern Washington State. In 2006 the company was sold to Kinross Gold Corp. who developed the discovery as the Buckhorn Gold Mine.</p><p>Mr. Alejandro Adams was also appointed to the Board replacing Geir Liland, who retired from service. We greatly thank Mr. Liland for his many years of directorship. Mr. Adams is a Chartered Professional Accountant who worked in a senior capacity with Exeter Resources, Extorre Gold and Rugby Mining, all companies associated with Adamera Chairman Yale Simpson.</p><p>Mr. Cooper a geologist, started working in the Republic district for Battle Mountain Gold followed by Crown Resources. He joined Kinross Gold through the Crown-Kinross merger in 2003. In 2007 he was promoted to Chief Geologist, overseeing mine production and exploration activities in the Buckhorn / Kettle River Mill gold operation. Peter played an integral role in taking the Buckhorn gold deposit from exploration to commercial production.</p><p>Mr. Currie is well known in the minerals industry, having had many years experience as a mining analyst and capital markets specialist. His depth of knowledge and business connections in the sector are important as we move forward with the Company projects.</p><p>CONTINUING OUR PRESENCE IN WASHINGTON STATE</p><p>After the work hiatus in Washington State, Adamera had to rehire and/or retrain local personnel to carry out the work programs. The crews that carried out claim staking, geological mapping, soil sampling and IP surveying contributed significantly to our 2020 success. It demonstrated the benefits of a long-term commitment to hiring locally as much as possible. More than 90% of the crew resides in the general Republic area and the remaining personnel are from various areas within Washington State within 200 kilometres of the projects. Our hire locally strategy enabled Adamera to perform the geophysical work using equipment owned and operated by us, a unique accomplishment for a junior company.</p><p>This has been a very different year for industry. I would like to thank the entire team at Adamera for their loyalty and hard work throughout an incredibly challenging year. The work we do in the field is typically difficult, made more so with the procedures imposed by COVID-19. We are very proud that the work was done safely and without incident.</p><p>I would like to thank the Board of Directors and the Advisors of the Company. I appreciate their significant contributions with regards to advice, support, and enthusiasm.</p><p>I am also grateful for the Hochschild partnership, it materialized at a time when we needed it. Their technical and financial ability, eagerness for discovery and keen interest in the district is appreciated.</p><p>Finally, I thank the many investors for their confidence, support, and patience. We are planning an active 2021 program and will be rolling out the exploration targets and exploration plans. I look forward to generating significant growth through exploration success.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors we wish you all a safe and a prosperous 2021.</p><p>Mark Kolebaba</p><p>President &amp;CEO</p><p>About Adamera</p><p>Adamera Minerals Corp. is exploring for a high-grade gold deposit near Republic Washington.

Their interest is primarily to follow up on targets that have returned high-grade drilling results. Adamera is acting as the operator of the JV. See news release dated January 22, 2020.)</p><p>In early 2020 at Cooke Mountain, under the JV the Company successfully:</p><p>1) Completed detailed mapping at Lamefoot South.</p><p>2) Completed deep induced polarization (IP) surveying at Oversight, Lamefoot South and Goodfoot properties. All of the targets are in close proximity to previous mines.</p><p>3) Developed high-priority drill targets at Lamefoot South, Goodfoot and Oversight properties for 2021 drilling.</p><p>4) Increased the land position at Cooke Mountain by staking Iron Mountain (~3000 acres)</p><p>5) Completed geological mapping and prospecting on the Iron Mountain property.</p><p>On the Adamera 100% owned projects the Company successfully:</p><p>1) Completed Staking the Buckhorn 2.0 property.</p><p>2) Conducted geological mapping and prospecting on select areas of the property.</p><p>3) Identified targets at the Magnetic Mine prospect on the Buckhorn 2.0 project and submitted a plan of operation for 2021 drilling.</p><p>4) Identified targets at the Keystone prospect on the Buckhorn 2.0 project and submitted a plan of operation for 2021 drilling.</p><p>5) Identified large high priority areas on the property for immediate ground geophysical and geochemical surveying.</p><p>PRE-COVID WORK IN 2020</p><p>Click Image To View Full Size</p><p>Cooke Mountain Staking</p><p>As part of the Cooke Mountain Agreement, Hochschild and Adamera expanded the Cooke Mountain project to the south by staking the Iron Mountain property prior to closures related to Covid-19. A total of 182 claims were staked, 129 of which are related to the new Iron Mountain claim block. (See news release dated March 11, 2020.)</p><p>Program Planning and Marketing</p><p>In Q1 2020 Adamera began planning a program on the Cooke Mountain project which included deep penetrating IP surveying to further define our known targets. In addition, the Company focused on marketing the new JV, funding and attending conferences. Interviews with Eric Coffin and Greg McCoach were also conducted with positive responses. In early March, shortly after returning from the PDAC and metals investor forums in Toronto, COVID-19 shutdowns ensued. Field programs and operational procedures changed dramatically. (Click here to watch videos.)</p><p>WORK DURING COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS</p><p>During March, April and May Adamera closed its Vancouver office and shutdown all work programs in Washington state. During this shutdown the Company continued to work on data analysis and initiated plans to acquire land around the Buckhorn gold mine.</p><p>Buckhorn Project Acquisition</p><p>For some time Adamera has been collating information on the Buckhorn mine area to ascertain how much exploration had been conducted outside of the immediate mine area. Based on historical information it appears that Kinross had developed more than 100 targets on the claim block that were not drill tested. Furthermore, they had applied for permits to drill 950 holes from 675 drill pads and construct 120 kms of road to access the drill pads. The size and complexity of process stalled timely progress and the company subsequently dropped the bulk of the original land package to focus entirely on the mine site. The regional potential was determined by Adamera to be highly prospective and largely untested by drilling.</p><p>In early June, the State of Washington reduced COVID-19 restrictions, allowing Adamera to assemble a staking crew. On June 8, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a private agreement to lease 38 claims on Buckhorn Mountain. This transaction was followed by a large staking campaign, the Buckhorn 2.0 project.</p><p>Click Image To View Full Size</p><p>A total of 339 claims were staked over three weeks in June to surround the Crown Resources/Kinross patented claims on which the Buckhorn Mine is situated. With the addition of state leases, the Buckhorn 2.0 project now comprises 9100 acres of federal and state land. The property staked by Adamera covers much of the lands that originally constituted the Buckhorn project. (See news release dated July 22, 2020.)</p><p>A large portion of the land in the Buckhorn 2.0 claim block is US Forest Service (USFS) land previously managed by Okanagan Forest District. On October 1, 2020 the USFS transferred the Buckhorn lands from Okanagan Forest District to the Colville Forest District which typically manages lands with similar physiographic and ecological character. The Colville Forest District is responsible for the lands in the Republic mining district and is well familiar with the objectives of primary producers in the area. This is a significant and positive development for Adamera and the district.</p><p>Geological Mapping - Buckhorn 2.0 Claims</p><p>The crew that completed prospecting and geological mapping at Iron Mountain in mid June, began prospecting and geological mapping on the new Buckhorn 2.0 claims in July. This work identified several prospects including the Magnetic Mine for follow up exploration. Late in 2020, historic drill data from within the Buckhorn 2.0 claim block highlighted a drill intercept with 9 g/t gold over 7.5 metres. According to Adamera's 2020 geological mapping, the drill intercept is located 1.5 kilometres south of Kinross' Buckhorn Mine and within the same geological block. Adamera has prepared two separate Plan of Operations on the claim block for anticipated drilling in 2021. (See news release dated December 1, 2020.)</p><p>Geological Mapping - Iron Mountain Claims at Cooke Mountain and Lamefoot South</p><p>As staking was being carried out on the Adamera 100% owned Buckhorn 2.0 project, the JV at Cooke Mountain initiated prospecting and geological mapping of the new Iron Mountain claims. This work identified numerous historic workings and areas with elevated to highly anomalous gold values. One site yielded a grab sample with up to 18.6 g/t gold, confirming that prospective geology extends south onto the Iron Mountain claims despite the very limited outcrop exposure in the area. With so little outcrop traditional prospecting would have had little chance of success. Evaluation of this project will rely on the detailed soil geochemical and geophysical methods routinely employed by Adamera. (See news release dated October, 20, 2020.)</p><p>Before the end of the field season, the geological crew completed a detailed map of the Lamefoot South Property, immediately south of the high-grade Lamefoot gold mine. This work better located key lithological contacts that will greatly assist in target development and interpretation of the 2020 IP data.</p><p>IP surveying - Cooke Mountain Project</p><p>Click Image To View Full Size</p><p>Hochschild Mining Site Visit</p><p>In late June the Company assembled a separate crew to conduct the deep penetrating IP on the Cooke Mountain JV project. A total of 34-line kilometres of IP surveying was completed on the Oversight, Goodfoot and Lamefoot South target areas. The survey operated from July through to mid October and suffered several delays due to the fire threat. In early September, the Washington State imposed fire restrictions requiring work to cease by 1pm each day and by September 20 all IP surveying was completely shut down until the end of the month.</p><p>The IP data is currently being interpreted. Inversion modelling is taking longer to complete than expected but the data resolutions are better than anticipated. Preliminary inversion data has been received on the Goodfoot and Lamefoot South properties. The surveys appear to penetrate to depths greater than 200 metres and better define the same targets that had appeared in previous Adamera data. (See news release dated November 10, 2020.)</p><p>In November of 2020, Hochschild management visited the Cooke Mountain JV project. During the site visit the exploration targets and drilling plans for 2021 were discussed.</p><p>BOARD AND COMPANY ADVISOR APPOINTMENTS</p><p>In concert with the exploration activity by Adamera, the Company strengthened its Board by appointing Mark Jones and Alejandro Adams as directors and Peter Cooper and Graeme Curie as advisors.</p><p>Mr. Jones has over 40 years of management and board experience in the resource sector, including his highly valued leadership of Crown Resources. Crown discovered the very high-grade Crown Jewel gold deposit in northeastern Washington State. In 2006 the company was sold to Kinross Gold Corp. who developed the discovery as the Buckhorn Gold Mine.</p><p>Mr. Alejandro Adams was also appointed to the Board replacing Geir Liland, who retired from service. We greatly thank Mr. Liland for his many years of directorship. Mr. Adams is a Chartered Professional Accountant who worked in a senior capacity with Exeter Resources, Extorre Gold and Rugby Mining, all companies associated with Adamera Chairman Yale Simpson.</p><p>Mr. Cooper a geologist, started working in the Republic district for Battle Mountain Gold followed by Crown Resources. He joined Kinross Gold through the Crown-Kinross merger in 2003. In 2007 he was promoted to Chief Geologist, overseeing mine production and exploration activities in the Buckhorn / Kettle River Mill gold operation. Peter played an integral role in taking the Buckhorn gold deposit from exploration to commercial production.</p><p>Mr. Currie is well known in the minerals industry, having had many years experience as a mining analyst and capital markets specialist. His depth of knowledge and business connections in the sector are important as we move forward with the Company projects.</p><p>CONTINUING OUR PRESENCE IN WASHINGTON STATE</p><p>After the work hiatus in Washington State, Adamera had to rehire and/or retrain local personnel to carry out the work programs. The crews that carried out claim staking, geological mapping, soil sampling and IP surveying contributed significantly to our 2020 success. It demonstrated the benefits of a long-term commitment to hiring locally as much as possible. More than 90% of the crew resides in the general Republic area and the remaining personnel are from various areas within Washington State within 200 kilometres of the projects. Our hire locally strategy enabled Adamera to perform the geophysical work using equipment owned and operated by us, a unique accomplishment for a junior company.</p><p>This has been a very different year for industry. I would like to thank the entire team at Adamera for their loyalty and hard work throughout an incredibly challenging year. The work we do in the field is typically difficult, made more so with the procedures imposed by COVID-19. We are very proud that the work was done safely and without incident.</p><p>I would like to thank the Board of Directors and the Advisors of the Company. I appreciate their significant contributions with regards to advice, support, and enthusiasm.</p><p>I am also grateful for the Hochschild partnership, it materialized at a time when we needed it. Their technical and financial ability, eagerness for discovery and keen interest in the district is appreciated.</p><p>Finally, I thank the many investors for their confidence, support, and patience. We are planning an active 2021 program and will be rolling out the exploration targets and exploration plans. I look forward to generating significant growth through exploration success.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors we wish you all a safe and a prosperous 2021.</p><p>Mark Kolebaba President &amp; CEO</p><p>About Adamera</p><p>Adamera Minerals Corp. is exploring for a high-grade gold deposit near Republic Washington.

(TSXV: AL) (FSE: 6LLN) (OTC: ALXEF) (\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce receipt of the first analytical results from an October 2020 prospecting and sampling program at its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,069 hectares (24,880 acres) staked within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt and is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario. </p><p>In addition, a high-resolution airborne magnetic and VLF-EM survey was completed during October. Highlights of the 2020 Vixen North Phase 2 Exploration ProgramALX's initial 2020 prospecting program was halted by a major forest fire in August 2020. The follow-up Phase 2 program in October 2020 was designed to continue geological mapping and sampling at Vixen within important geological trends that indicate the presence of iron formation-hosted gold occurrences (see ALX news release dated September 9, 2020[1]). An additional 85 samples were taken during mapping work focused on two areas of Vixen North: the Vulpin Zone and the Dickenson Zone. Rock samples collected from outcrop and historical trenches at the Dickenson Zone ranged up to 17.7 grams/tonne gold (0.57 oz/ton gold) within a swarm of quartz veins that ALX crews traced on the ground for over 60 metres. ALX geologists describe the host veins as exhibiting evidence of \"multiple events with numerous openings of the vein system\", which would be a prospective setting for mineralizing processes.Mapping at the Vulpin Zone located more evidence of iron formation-style mineralization with samples collected ranging up to 7.21 grams/tonne gold (0.23 oz/ton gold).The Magnetite-Fluorite showing southeast of Vulpin was closely investigated for its possible surface expression of a Springpole-type deposit model where additional outcrop was located yielding several examples of fluorite mineralization. The Springpole gold deposit located approximately 6.0 kilometres to the southeast of Vixen hosts a fluorite occurrence interpreted to be genetic phase of porphyry-hosted gold deposition.The Echo Zone, 1.5 kilometres east of the Vulpin Zone, hosted by a feldspar porphyry is crosscut by a shear zone up to 100 metres wide containing multiple quartz veins up to 1 metre wide. The Echo Zone was traced for over 200 metres - initial samples showed anomalous gold values, with more results pending.A high-resolution helicopter-borne magnetic and VLF-EM survey totaling 475.7 line-kilometres was completed to better define a known 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend and other important structural trends present at Vixen North. Final data processing is pending. <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure1enhanced.jpgDickenson\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure1enhanced.jpgDickenson</url> ZoneTo view an enhanced version of this map, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure1enhanced.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure1enhanced.jpg</url>[2]<url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure2enhanced.jpgVulpin\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure2enhanced.jpgVulpin</url> ZoneTo view an enhanced version of map, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure2enhanced.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure2enhanced.jpg</url>[3]ALX is currently planning a winter drilling program at Vixen based upon the geochemical and geophysical results received to date, and intends to submit a permit application to the Government of Ontario and consult with local communities in November 2020.Click here[4] to view maps and photos of the Vixen Gold Project.About ALX's Exploration at Vixen After a successful reconnaissance sampling program at Vixen in late 2019, where ALX collected rock samples ranging up to 23.9 g/t gold (0.765 oz/ton) (see ALX news release and photos dated December 12, 2019[5]), ALX carried out a follow-up helicopter-supported, prospecting and sampling program in early August 2020 (the \"Phase 1 2020 Program\"). Rock samples collected in 2020 at Vixen North ranged up to 8.41 g/t gold, with two of three samples collected in a newly-recognized mineralized zone located in the central part of the property named the Vulpin Zone returning gold values greater than 1.0 g/t. Historical sampling also found significant gold values: Vixen Gold Project - Vulpin Zone, 2019-2020 and Historical Gold Results greater than 1.0 g/t GoldDuring the Phase 1 2020 Program, gold occurrences were found within gossanous and magnetite-bearing host rocks, leading to the possibility of banded iron formation (\"BIF\") gold deposits at Vixen, a gold deposit model which has not been historically sought after in the Vixen area. However, the Springpole Gold deposit1 (owned by First Mining Gold Corp.) located six kilometres to the south of Vixen North demonstrates the influence of NNW-trending BIF for hosting gold mineralization confirmed by both surface mapping and the detection of strong magnetic high anomalies observed in a 2004 aeromagnetic survey2. At Springpole, strong evidence exists that gold and associated fluorite mineralization is genetically related to the high-level emplacement of a large, alkaline porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex (\"APB\")3. ALX is currently reviewing the interpreted iron formation and fluorite occurrences at Vixen North to evaluate the presence of an APB gold mineralization model at the Project.1 Springpole contains a reported Indicated mineral resource estimate of 139.1 million tonnes at 1.04 g/t gold and 5.4 g/t silver, containing 4.67 million ounces of gold and 24.19 million ounces of silver, and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 11.4 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t gold and 3.1 g/t silver, containing 230,000 ounces of gold and 1.12 million ounces of silver (Source: First Mining Gold Corp., 2020). 2 Preliminary Economic Assessment Update for the Springpole Gold Project, Ontario, Canada, prepared for First Mining Gold Corp. by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., November 2019. 3 Technical report on the Springpole Lake Property, Red Make Mining Division, NW Ontario, for Gold Canyon Resources Inc., (Zabey, 2002).About Vixen and the Red Lake Mining DistrictTo date, the Red Lake Mining District (\"Red Lake\") has produced over 28 million ounces of gold since mines began production in 1925 (readers are cautioned that mineralization present on adjacent properties may not be present at Vixen). Historic gold mines in the Red Lake camp include the Campbell mine, the Red Lake mine, and the Couchenour-Williams mine, all multi-million ounce gold producers. Vixen lies within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt, a geological trend located to the northeast of Red Lake that hosts numerous historical gold mines and showings and is highly-prospective for new showings of gold mineralization. The Argosy Mine, located approximately 2.0 kilometres from the Vixen North claim boundary, produced approximately 102,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1952. The Springpole Gold Project, operated by First Mining Gold Corp., is located approximately 6.0 kilometres from the Vixen North boundary.ALX considers Vixen historically underexplored where areas of limited outcrop have inhibited surface exploration and utilizes detailed prospecting, leading-edge geochemical techniques, and geophysical surveys to identify new drill targets. National Instrument 43-101 DisclosureThe technical information in this news release was reviewed and approved by Sierd Eriks, P. Geo., President and Chief Geologist of the Company, who is a Qualified Person in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101.

(\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce receipt of the first analytical results from an October 2020 prospecting and sampling program at its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,069 hectares (24,880 acres) staked within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt and is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario. In addition, a high-resolution airborne magnetic and VLF-EM survey was completed during October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights of the 2020 Vixen North Phase 2 Exploration Program</p><p>ALX's initial 2020 prospecting program was halted by a major forest fire in August 2020. The follow-up Phase 2 program in October 2020 was designed to continue geological mapping and sampling at Vixen within important geological trends that indicate the presence of iron formation-hosted gold occurrences (see ALX news release dated September 9, 2020). An additional 85 samples were taken during mapping work focused on two areas of Vixen North: the Vulpin Zone and the Dickenson Zone. * Rock samples collected from outcrop and historical trenches at the Dickenson Zone ranged up to 17.7 grams/tonne gold (0.57 oz/ton gold) within a swarm of quartz veins that ALX crews traced on the ground for over 60 metres. ALX geologists describe the host veins as exhibiting evidence of \"...multiple events with numerous openings of the vein system\", which would be a prospective setting for mineralizing processes. * Mapping at the Vulpin Zone located more evidence of iron formation-style mineralization with samples collected ranging up to 7.21 grams/tonne gold (0.23 oz/ton gold). * The Magnetite-Fluorite showing southeast of Vulpin was closely investigated for its possible surface expression of a Springpole-type deposit model where additional outcrop was located yielding several examples of fluorite mineralization. The Springpole gold deposit located approximately 6.0 kilometres to the southeast of Vixen hosts a fluorite occurrence interpreted to be genetic phase of porphyry-hosted gold deposition. * The Echo Zone, 1.5 kilometres east of the Vulpin Zone, hosted by a feldspar porphyry is crosscut by a shear zone up to 100 metres wide containing multiple quartz veins up to 1 metre wide. The Echo Zone was traced for over 200 metres - initial samples showed anomalous gold values, with more results pending. * A high-resolution helicopter-borne magnetic and VLF-EM survey totaling 475.7 line-kilometres was completed to better define a known 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend and other important structural trends present at Vixen North. Final data processing is pending.</p><p>Dickenson Zone</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this map, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure1enhanced.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure1enhanced.jpg</url></p><p>Vulpin Zone</p><p>To view an enhanced version of map, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure2enhanced.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/67074_alxfigure2enhanced.jpg</url></p><p>ALX is currently planning a winter drilling program at Vixen based upon the geochemical and geophysical results received to date, and intends to submit a permit application to the Government of Ontario and consult with local communities in November 2020.</p><p>Click here to view maps and photos of the Vixen Gold Project.</p><p>About ALX's Exploration at Vixen</p><p>After a successful reconnaissance sampling program at Vixen in late 2019, where ALX collected rock samples ranging up to 23.9 g/t gold (0.765 oz/ton) (see ALX news release and photos dated December 12, 2019), ALX carried out a follow-up helicopter-supported, prospecting and sampling program in early August 2020 (the \"Phase 1 2020 Program\"). Rock samples collected in 2020 at Vixen North ranged up to 8.41 g/t gold, with two of three samples collected in a newly-recognized mineralized zone located in the central part of the property named the Vulpin Zone returning gold values greater than 1.0 g/t.

However, the Springpole Gold deposit1 (owned by First Mining Gold Corp.) located six kilometres to the south of Vixen North demonstrates the influence of NNW-trending BIF for hosting gold mineralization confirmed by both surface mapping and the detection of strong magnetic high anomalies observed in a 2004 aeromagnetic survey2. At Springpole, strong evidence exists that gold and associated fluorite mineralization is genetically related to the high-level emplacement of a large, alkaline porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex (\"APB\")3. ALX is currently reviewing the interpreted iron formation and fluorite occurrences at Vixen North to evaluate the presence of an APB gold mineralization model at the Project.</p><p>1 Springpole contains a reported Indicated mineral resource estimate of 139.1 million tonnes at 1.04 g/t gold and 5.4 g/t silver, containing 4.67 million ounces of gold and 24.19 million ounces of silver, and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 11.4 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t gold and 3.1 g/t silver, containing 230,000 ounces of gold and 1.12 million ounces of silver (Source: First Mining Gold Corp., 2020). 2 Preliminary Economic Assessment Update for the Springpole Gold Project, Ontario, Canada, prepared for First Mining Gold Corp. by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., November 2019. 3 Technical report on the Springpole Lake Property, Red Make Mining Division, NW Ontario, for Gold Canyon Resources Inc., (Zabey, 2002).</p><p>About Vixen and the Red Lake Mining District</p><p>To date, the Red Lake Mining District (\"Red Lake\") has produced over 28 million ounces of gold since mines began production in 1925 (readers are cautioned that mineralization present on adjacent properties may not be present at Vixen). Historic gold mines in the Red Lake camp include the Campbell mine, the Red Lake mine, and the Couchenour-Williams mine, all multi-million ounce gold producers. Vixen lies within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt, a geological trend located to the northeast of Red Lake that hosts numerous historical gold mines and showings and is highly-prospective for new showings of gold mineralization. The Argosy Mine, located approximately 2.0 kilometres from the Vixen North claim boundary, produced approximately 102,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1952. The Springpole Gold Project, operated by First Mining Gold Corp., is located approximately 6.0 kilometres from the Vixen North boundary.</p><p>ALX considers Vixen historically underexplored where areas of limited outcrop have inhibited surface exploration and utilizes detailed prospecting, leading-edge geochemical techniques, and geophysical surveys to identify new drill targets.</p><p>National Instrument 43-101 Disclosure</p><p>The technical information in this news release was reviewed and approved by Sierd Eriks, P.

Dabanl\u0131 stated that they are working on geographic information systems and trying to create added value through multiple projects, such as preventing water loss and forest fires.  He explained that they have developed AI-based software to track the course of forest fires. \u201cAfter a forest fire starts, considering the type of forest, the slope of the terrain, meteorological conditions and the direction and speed of the wind, we model which way the fire will spread. We predict the area the fire will reach within one to two hours and determine which AI-supported methods can be applied to contain it and extinguish it as quickly as possible. We have developed modeling, simulation and firefighting software for this purpose,\" he said.  Dabanl\u0131 highlighted that the system was awarded by the United Nations last year, adding: \u201cThe system is currently actively used in the Fire Control Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Users input information about fires in their regions along with field intervention data. The simulation continuously runs, showing dynamically, \u2018We took this measure, based on that, where could the fire reach in an hour?\u2019 They can see where field teams are located and observe images from other cameras and drones to facilitate firefighting efforts.\u201d  Dabanl\u0131 said they are carrying out new studies on navigation in forest areas: \u201cWe ensure that vehicles in the forest reach the site in the fastest and most accurate way and that the results of measures taken in the field are observed more quickly. We continue developing software that makes the management of teams easier in this new era.\u201d  He added that, as in the rest of the world, the nature of forest fires is changing in T\u00fcrkiye and efforts will continue to minimize the damage of forest fires using artificial intelligence and decision-support systems.  Istanbul Forest Innovation Week started on Monday, bringing together international experts, policymakers and environmental organizations to explore sustainable forestry practices. The event, organized by the General Directorate of Forestry (OGM), features expert panels, exhibitions and international collaborations aimed at shaping a greener, smarter and more resilient future for the world\u2019s forests.  At the opening of the event, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakl\u0131 emphasized T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s leadership in sustainable and technology-driven forestry practices.  He stated, \u201cT\u00fcrkiye is leading the way in global forestry innovation, setting an example for the world with its commitment to smart, sustainable forest management.\u201d  The event brought together international experts to explore sustainable forestry practices.

We've got some breaking news in Canada, unfortunately, terrible news. Canada has now surpassed 10,000 deaths from COVID-19. 10,000 deaths! Remember, the first death was out at the Lynn Valley in March, I think it was March 9th at the Lynn Valley long-term care facility, a man in his 80s passed away there. We are now 10,000 deaths and COVID cases are again on the rise. That's prompted some governments to bring in new restrictions as governments consider where and when to roll out the new restrictions. </p><p>Some mayors are pushing back though. Four mayors in Ontario's Halton region says no new restrictions are warranted in their region, and they slammed what they call a blanket approach, while over 200 gym owners in Quebec say they will open soon, even if the government doesn't, because the government doesn't have the data to prove that they're the cause of the spread. So do governments need to be more flexible and more creative when it comes to these COVID-19 restrictions, or is this push-back a symptom of COVID-19 fatigue, something frankly the prime minister spoke about today? The press gallery's here. The Globe and Mail's Bob Fife joins us from Ottawa; in Montreal, le Devoir's Emilie Nicola; and our special guest is the Burlington city mayor, Marianne Meed Ward, one of the mayors pushing back against potentially increasing restrictions in her region. Good to see all of you. Mayor, of course we have to start with you, why are you pushing back against potential new restrictions? What's the issue?</p><p>MARIANNE MEED WARD (Burlington Mayor): We want to make sure that the evidence supports any new restrictions, and our public is actually demanding that, and so are the businesses. I think that's fair, it's reasonable. When you look at the various metrics, there's lots of different ways to measure whether you have reached a crisis point, and we looked at the numbers and we said we don't need it, and so we presented that evidence to the medical officer of health and the premier, and they agreed with us. So we're looking for a more targeted and strategic approach based on the health evidence.</p><p>SOLOMON: Okay, so can you just drill down there. Provinces, whether it's Quebec, Ontario, they're saying, there's lots of push-back. They're saying they need to do this. Now we've surpassed 10,000 deaths. It's a big concern about the second wave. What data do you want specifically? How would you recalibrate these restrictions, Mayor?</p><p>MEED WARD: Well it's really important to distinguish between the hot spots, which are Toronto, Peel, Ottawa, York and Halton region, and other parts of the province, frankly. We're geographically next to those hot spots but we're not the same in terms of the indicators. And so when you hear statements like our numbers have gone up, they haven't gone up to the same degree everywhere in the province, certainly not everywhere in the region, or even in the country. And so that's why we're asking for a targeted approach. So you look at our daily infection rates are still well below the provincial average. The \"R\" factor, which you want to be below one, we are. You look at hospital capacity, we're well below, we have a pandemic response unit at Joseph Brant Hospital with 91 beds we've never had to use, thankfully. And when you look at where the source of the majority of our increases in Halton have come from, unfortunately and tragically it's been long-term care homes, and we have implemented very targeted measures there. So that kind of got us on to let's look at where the source is in our community and focus specifically there instead of taking this blunt one size fits all approach.</p><p>SOLOMON: All right, and by the way, Ottawa's pushed back. Bob Fife, is there a big issue of the flexibility of the government, or as the prime minister admitted today, just a lot of COVID fatigue.</p><p>ROBERT FIFE (Globe and Mail): Well certainly there's a lot of COVID fatigue, there's no doubt about that, and I think that's probably why we've seen such a big spike because people are going out, they're hanging around with people they shouldn't be, they're in large crowds. But the mayor is right in the sense that, and I think even health experts are saying that you have to treat this pandemic as a big forest fire. There will be areas where it will die down and you can have less restrictions, and you must focus on areas where the fire is really burning, and clearly Toronto, and Peel, and Ottawa are areas. Now it's not to say that perhaps there can be, and this would have to be a decision of health officials, but it may be that, you know, you should be closing down bars, but restaurants that have big capacity and put in proper screening for example, maybe they can be allowed to have indoor food. Some gyms, I worked out at Goodlife here and I felt it was very, very safe, the way they operated it, but at the same time, we have to listen to our health professionals. If they say we should close these down, then we close them down. Guiding light is listen to what our health professionals are saying.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah. But, Emilie, I spoke to a gym owner, a woman who owns 12 yoga studios in the Montreal area after Premier Legault extended the red zone lockdown to November 23rd by another month, she and 200 others said unless you provide the data that we're the cause of the spread, we're going to open anyway. So this is going to be, and the premier said today they're going to get fined. Is this heading to a lot of civil disobedience here? What do you think?</p><p>EMILIE NICOLAS (Le Devoir): I don't know if they will have the guts to actually follow through with their words, but there is definitely this COVID fatigue that we're seeing, and it's mostly a frustration not with, I don't think there's anyone who wants to contribute to the pandemic, there's just a lot of business owners who are convinced that they're not, or they haven't been convinced otherwise. Actually there's no data that proves that they are the source. In terms of the rhetoric of the premiers here in Quebec, it's very much about how schools are the priority, and we need to sacrifice things for our children, and that's a very important message that people need to understand as well. It's just that, for example, here you haven't had masks being mandatory for example in high schools, and we know that teenagers can be spreaders, and schools was mandatory like in Ontario, so there's ways in which people can be perhaps those business owners are taking some hits, basically for something that they haven't caused, and that's maybe not helping the kids to stay in schools that much either.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah, mayor, let me just go back to you. We're seeing riots in cities in Europe like Milan over restrictions. But, you know, I know, I appreciate what you're saying in your city, but, you know, the premiers and the health officials are saying, if you start easing up restrictions, or you don't increase these restrictions, we're going to have yet another outbreak. We've already seen the second wave. What's your response to that? They believe that this is preventative. They don't want to be reactive.</p><p>MEED WARD: Well, and all of us want to be preventative, and in fact in Burlington, about a week and a half ago our medical officer of health asked us to voluntarily suspend fitness classes. We did that within 24 hours in the city facilities. They said you should suspend game play and only allow training or practice. We again did that immediately for all our sports fields and facilities. We took some push-back, but we listened, and we said, look, there's evidence that these are high risk activities and we want to get out in front of this, and that was precisely to avoid the bigger blanket lockdown. And so our community, though they definitely grumbled about that, they could see that if we can focus in or target closures rather than a blanket approach, we can still hang on to some of those other activities that actually frankly aren't high risk.</p><p>SOLOMON: Bob, does the government, the federal government and provincial government start, do they need to recalibrate the message, because cracks are starting to show after eight or nine months in the consensus here.</p><p>FIFE: Yeah. You know I think they're all trying do their best on this. It's a very difficult situation because we're, you know, what it's seventh month into the pandemic and people are, I think most people are being very good, but nonetheless there is fatigue. And the government's message sometimes gets, I don't think, I don't know how many people are listening. But they're going to start listening very soon because our hospitals are filling up, and the death rate is going to start to climb, and then I think that it's going to have an effect on people and pull them back and say, wait a minute, what am I doing? Should I be going out to this event with people I don't know? I think people are going to start to recalibrate in the next couple of weeks because those numbers are going to go up, the death rates.</p><p>SOLOMON: And Emilie, just real quick, big restrictions in Quebec. Are you seeing results? Are people believing there's a relationship between the sacrifice and the restrictions and flattening the curve, or is it the fact that people just aren't seeing any correlation there that's causing the pushback?</p><p>NICOLA: There is a flattening of the curve, and they've extended the measures for another 28 days with the promise that they might review some of them in two weeks. So it's workingish. It's never going to work fully as long as schools are open, and they need to stay open, but it's just, you know, winter is coming. People might, there's a lot of mental health issues still already happening, and we're changing the time of the day next, you know, this weekend, and it's going to get darker, people are going to get more depressed as well as it happens a lot with seasonal depression, so I think there's a lot of other issues that we need to also take into consideration when we consider what measures and how much we basically kill people's social life.</p><p>SOLOMON: Right. Don't get me depressed now. That's getting me down a little. It's getting darker.</p><p>NICOLA: No, I won't.</p><p>SOLOMON: I know, I've got leave it there. Mayor Marianne Meed Ward, listen it's tough to, right now this is probably the toughest job any of our leaders have right now, so we appreciate you joining us and communicating. Emilie and Bob, please still around. We'll be right back. We've got to take a short break. I want to dig into the Liberals holding two seats in a pandemic by-election. How much should we read into that? We'll also bring on Tom Mulcair to join the press gallery. Stay with \"Power Play.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:616P-YHD1-JCF0-K00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTV Televisions, Inc.

(TSXV: AL) (FSE: 6LLN) (OTC: ALXEF) (\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the results of a prospecting and sampling program at its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,069 hectares (24,880 acres) staked within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt and is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario. </p><p>The onset of a major forest fire in the second week of August and the subsequent evacuation of the town of Red Lake, ON ended the exploration work abruptly at its half-way point - however, in their time on the ground ALX geologists collected 99 rock samples in thickly-forested terrain and were able to identify some important geological trends at Vixen North that indicate the presence of iron-formation-hosted gold occurrences.Highlights of the 2020 Prospecting and Sampling ProgramBased on exploration work carried out during the summer of 2020, the Company highlights the following for its newly-interpreted Vulpin Zone at Vixen North (click on map below): Iron formation associated gold mineralization with three samples ranging from 0.89 to 8.41 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold; Historical samples collected along the length of the Vulpin Zone range up to 22.73 g/t gold;Reinterpretation of a 1992 airborne magnetic survey shows a high magnetic anomaly over 3,000 metres in length;NNW-trending shear zone coincident for much of the Vulpin Zone;Multiple gold occurrences are present along the strike of the interpreted structure and geophysical anomaly;Gold mineralization found within a fluorite occurrence southwest of the Vulpin Zone may represent a genetic phase of porphyry-hosted gold deposition. <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/63447_figure1.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/63447_figure1.jpg</url> Figure 1To view an enhanced version of Figure 1, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/63447_figure1.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3046/63447_figure1.jpg</url>[1]After a successful reconnaissance sampling program at Vixen in late 2019, where ALX collected rock samples ranging up to 23.9 g/t gold (0.765 oz/ton) (see ALX news release and photos dated December 12, 2019[2]), ALX carried out a follow up helicopter-supported, prospecting and sampling program in early August 2020 (the \"2020 Program\"). Rock samples collected in 2020 at Vixen North ranged up to 8.41 g/t gold, with two of three samples collected in a newly-recognized mineralized zone located in the central part of the property named the Vulpin Zone returning gold values greater than 1.0 g/t. Historical sampling also found significant gold values:Vixen Gold Project - Vulpin Zone, 2019-2020 and Historical Gold Results greater than 1.0 g/t GoldDuring the 2020 Program, gold occurrences were found within gossanous and magnetite-bearing host rocks, leading to the possibility of banded iron formation (\"BIF\") gold deposits at Vixen, a gold deposit model which has not been historically sought after in the Vixen area. However, the Springpole Gold deposit1 (owned by First Mining Gold Corp.) located six kilometres to the south of Vixen North demonstrates the influence of NNW-trending BIF for hosting gold mineralization confirmed by both surface mapping and the detection of strong magnetic high anomalies observed in a 2004 aeromagnetic survey2. At Springpole, strong evidence exists that gold and associated fluorite mineralization is genetically related to the high-level emplacement of a large, alkaline porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex (\"APB\")3. ALX is currently reviewing the interpreted iron formation and fluorite occurrences at Vixen North to evaluate the presence of an APB gold mineralization model at the Project.1 Springpole contains a reported Indicated mineral resource estimate of 139.1 million tonnes at 1.04 g/t gold and 5.4 g/t silver, containing 4.67 million ounces of gold and 24.19 million ounces of silver, and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 11.4 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t gold and 3.1 g/t silver, containing 230,000 ounces of gold and 1.12 million ounces of silver (Source: First Mining Gold Corp., 2020).2 Preliminary Economic Assessment Update for the Springpole Gold Project, Ontario, Canada, prepared for First Mining Gold Corp. by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., November 2019.3 Technical report on the Springpole Lake Property, Red Make Mining Division, NW Ontario, for Gold Canyon Resources Inc., (Zabey, 2002).ALX has reviewed the digital data from a 1992 airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey flown over what is now Vixen North in conjunction with the 2020 Program results. The northern edge of a 3.0 kilometre-long magnetic high anomaly is coincident with a series of gold occurrences at the Vulpin Zone mapped in the abridged 2020 Program. The strong magnetic high feature curls southward into a lake that obscures any bedrock expression (see map above entitled \"Vixen Gold Project - Vulpin Zone - 2020, 2019 &amp;#38; Historical Gold Assay Results - Total Magnetics Vertical Derivative\"). ALX also interprets a broad NNW-trending shear zone striking through the Vulpin Zone that further supports the BIF hypothesis. ALX is planning more surface exploration work at Vixen for the Fall of 2020, including additional prospecting, soil and lake sediment sampling, and ground geophysical surveys.Click here[3] to view maps and photos of the Vixen Gold Project. About Vixen and the Red Lake Mining DistrictTo date, the Red Lake Mining District (\"Red Lake\") has produced over 28 million ounces of gold since mines began production in 1925 (readers are cautioned that mineralization present on adjacent properties may not be present at Vixen). Historic gold mines in the Red Lake camp include the Campbell mine, the Red Lake mine, and the Couchenour-Williams mine, all multi-million ounce gold producers. Vixen lies within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt, a geological trend located to the northeast of Red Lake that hosts numerous historical gold mines and showings and is highly-prospective for new showings of gold mineralization. The Argosy Mine, located approximately 2.0 kilometres from the Vixen North claim boundary, produced approximately 102,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1952. The Springpole Gold Project, operated by First Mining Gold Corp., is located approximately 6.0 kilometres from the Vixen North boundary.ALX considers Vixen historically underexplored where areas of limited outcrop have inhibited surface exploration and plans to identify new drill targets through detailed prospecting, leading-edge geochemical techniques, and geophysical surveys.

(\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the results of a prospecting and sampling program at its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,069 hectares (24,880 acres) staked within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt and is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario. The onset of a major forest fire in the second week of August and the subsequent evacuation of the town of Red Lake, ON ended the exploration work abruptly at its half-way point - however, in their time on the ground ALX geologists collected 99 rock samples in thickly-forested terrain and were able to identify some important geological trends at Vixen North that indicate the presence of iron-formation-hosted gold occurrences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights of the 2020 Prospecting and Sampling Program</p><p>Based on exploration work carried out during the summer of 2020, the Company highlights the following for its newly-interpreted Vulpin Zone at Vixen North (click on map below): //st * Iron formation associated gold mineralization with three samples ranging from 0.89 to 8.41 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold; * Historical samples collected along the length of the Vulpin Zone range up to 22.73 g/t gold; * Reinterpretation of a 1992 airborne magnetic survey shows a high magnetic anomaly over 3,000 metres in length; * NNW-trending shear zone coincident for much of the Vulpin Zone; * Multiple gold occurrences are present along the strike of the interpreted structure and geophysical anomaly; * Gold mineralization found within a fluorite occurrence southwest of the Vulpin Zone may represent a genetic phase of porphyry-hosted gold deposition.

Rock samples collected in 2020 at Vixen North ranged up to 8.41 g/t gold, with two of three samples collected in a newly-recognized mineralized zone located in the central part of the property named the Vulpin Zone returning gold values greater than 1.0 g/t.

However, the Springpole Gold deposit1 (owned by First Mining Gold Corp.) located six kilometres to the south of Vixen North demonstrates the influence of NNW-trending BIF for hosting gold mineralization confirmed by both surface mapping and the detection of strong magnetic high anomalies observed in a 2004 aeromagnetic survey2. At Springpole, strong evidence exists that gold and associated fluorite mineralization is genetically related to the high-level emplacement of a large, alkaline porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex (\"APB\")3. ALX is currently reviewing the interpreted iron formation and fluorite occurrences at Vixen North to evaluate the presence of an APB gold mineralization model at the Project.</p><p>1 Springpole contains a reported Indicated mineral resource estimate of 139.1 million tonnes at 1.04 g/t gold and 5.4 g/t silver, containing 4.67 million ounces of gold and 24.19 million ounces of silver, and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 11.4 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t gold and 3.1 g/t silver, containing 230,000 ounces of gold and 1.12 million ounces of silver (Source: First Mining Gold Corp., 2020).</p><p>2 Preliminary Economic Assessment Update for the Springpole Gold Project, Ontario, Canada, prepared for First Mining Gold Corp. by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., November 2019.</p><p>3 Technical report on the Springpole Lake Property, Red Make Mining Division, NW Ontario, for Gold Canyon Resources Inc., (Zabey, 2002).</p><p>ALX has reviewed the digital data from a 1992 airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey flown over what is now Vixen North in conjunction with the 2020 Program results. The northern edge of a 3.0 kilometre-long magnetic high anomaly is coincident with a series of gold occurrences at the Vulpin Zone mapped in the abridged 2020 Program. The strong magnetic high feature curls southward into a lake that obscures any bedrock expression (see map above entitled \"Vixen Gold Project - Vulpin Zone - 2020, 2019 &amp;Historical Gold Assay Results - Total Magnetics Vertical Derivative\"). ALX also interprets a broad NNW-trending shear zone striking through the Vulpin Zone that further supports the BIF hypothesis.</p><p>ALX is planning more surface exploration work at Vixen for the Fall of 2020, including additional prospecting, soil and lake sediment sampling, and ground geophysical surveys.</p><p>Click here to view maps and photos of the Vixen Gold Project.</p><p>About Vixen and the Red Lake Mining District</p><p>To date, the Red Lake Mining District (\"Red Lake\") has produced over 28 million ounces of gold since mines began production in 1925 (readers are cautioned that mineralization present on adjacent properties may not be present at Vixen). Historic gold mines in the Red Lake camp include the Campbell mine, the Red Lake mine, and the Couchenour-Williams mine, all multi-million ounce gold producers. Vixen lies within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt, a geological trend located to the northeast of Red Lake that hosts numerous historical gold mines and showings and is highly-prospective for new showings of gold mineralization. The Argosy Mine, located approximately 2.0 kilometres from the Vixen North claim boundary, produced approximately 102,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1952.

The buildings had been abandoned and derelict for 60 years, when the Friends of Wells Gray Park and BC Parks co-funded a restoration project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Stillwater Road turns right off the Clearwater Valley Road at km 35.7, just south of the Park entrance. The road descends to Blackwater Creek, then climbs up the other side of the valley. The trailhead to the Bee Farm is signed at km 3.5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A hike of less than 10 minutes leads to Smith Lake which is 400 m long at an elevation of 750 m. The trail skirts the lake on the right or south side, then goes over undulating terrain with a gradual descent to the next junction. Here, follow the left fork which soon reaches a collapsed bridge over Hemp Creek.</p><p>Continue upstream along Hemp Creek for about 30 minutes to reach the Bee Farm. The three main structures are the cabin, bee shed, and outhouse.</p><p>The Bee Farm is the story of two remarkable sisters, Jessie and Frances Emery. Jessie was born on Aug. 16, 1910 and Frances on May 23, 1913. Eventually, the family had nine children and they moved from Alberta to East Blackpool near Clearwater in 1922. The girls' father, Ernest, had invested in some bees and Jessie gradually took over his beekeeping tasks as she got older.</p><p>In the summer of 1926, life in Upper Clearwater took a dramatic change when a huge forest fire swept through the valley. Large burned tracts of land created by the fire were soon covered in fireweed, willow and other deciduous shrubs. Ernest died in 1928 and, by 1930, the Great Depression was taking hold on western Canada.</p><p>Read More: Valley Voices: Cupid in the apiary</p><p>Jessie still managed to earn a small income from her six beehives on the Blackpool farm. The bee inspector told her about the vast fields of fireweed growing in the Hemp Creek Valley, thanks to the fire of 1926. In Upper North Thompson Reflections, Frances described how she and Jessie, assisted by older brother Norman and younger brother Ralph, relocated their beekeeping operation:</p><p>Jessie filed for a homestead there in 1930 when we were 20 and 17, and we moved the bees to the Upper Clearwater Valley. Norman and Jessie built the cabin while Ralph and I split shakes and helped any way we could. There were beautiful cedar trees that had been killed by the fire but not really burned. What lumber we needed was split from them ...</p><p>Any other materials needed had to be packed to the Bee Farm, as the end of the road in 1930 was near Trout Creek.</p><p>The Canadian Association of Palynologists estimates that, to produce one pound of honey, bees must visit two million flowers, fly about 80,000 km and carry about 37,000 loads of nectar back to the hive. During peak flower blooming periods, bees from a single hive may visit up to 250,000 flowers in a single day. With such activity, a beekeeper's job continues year-round and, in the case of the Emery sisters, they had to hike quite a distance into the wilderness to tend their bees.</p><p>In spring, the hives' winter insulation was unwrapped, food supplies checked and dead colonies removed. If the queen was productive, the hive filled quickly with brood and honey and could run out of space, causing swarming. This was prevented by adding extra shelves (or supers), giving more space for honey production. In summer, honey was removed, processed and packed. During fall, the colony's health and strength had to be checked again because weak or diseased hives would be unlikely to survive the winter.</p><p>The sisters also had to protect their hives from invading animals because bee larvae and honey were a delicacy for bears, skunks and raccoons. In winter, the girls also had to check the hives regularly because the bees could suffocate if the entrance to the hives was blocked by a heavy snowfall. Charlie Ludtke recalled that his brother Fred had a trapline near the Bee Farm and he cleared away the snow from the hives when he went by.</p><p>After they had set up their beekeeping operation among the fields of fireweed, the Bee Girls realized they needed to expand, so they doubled their hives to 12 and began to enjoy even more plentiful honey harvests. They sold their honey for up to 18 cents per pound locally. With each of the 12 hives producing 200 to 250 pounds of honey, the girls could make as much as $540 per year.</p><p>Their business was flourishing.</p><p>The Shook family arrived in the Clearwater Valley in 1934 with nine children and homesteaded near Grouse Creek. Two of the boys were Floyd and Roy. Frances Emery recalled, \"On March 1, 1934, Jessie and I headed for the Bee Farm to clean up the bee supers. On the way, we picked up the mail for the valley settlers and, while we were delivering it, we met Floyd and Roy Shook.\"</p><p>Soon the brothers arrived at the Bee Farm where they helped the girls finish some of the buildings and built a bee house for the hives. The romance developed from there. Frances married Floyd in 1936 and Jessie married Roy the following year. Two weeks after that wedding, Roy and Floyd's sister Freda married Frances and Jessie's brother Ralph, creating a triple relationship between two families of nine children.</p><p>Jessie and Frances kept the Bee Farm operating until about 1940. They did most of the work themselves because Roy and Floyd were busy on the homesteads and not too interested in bees after all. Both had young children and trips to the Bee Farm entailed packing children along too. In addition, the forest was gradually growing again after the fire and replacing the once-abundant fireweed with other plants. The hives were brought out from the Bee Farm about 1945. Jessie kept a few hives at home until she was in her sixties.</p><p>Roy Shook owned several small sawmills and the family moved frequently between mill sites. Jessie was kept busy with their five children, her wonderful gardens, and her beehives. They retired in Barnhartvale, a suburb of Kamloops. Jessie died in 1991 and Roy in 1999. Frances and Floyd raised four children and moved to Vavenby in 1947, then to Barriere, Louis Creek and back to Vavenby in 1960. Frances returned to the Bee Farm only once, with her brother-in-law Charlie, when she was 80. Charlie wrote about this event:</p><p>Fifty-four years after leaving the Bee Farm, Frances Shook came back... Frances' greatest fear was that her old home would be dilapidated, but she was pleasantly surprised at what she saw. The lilac bush still grows strongly and blooms well, a big reward for backpacking in its first beginnings and giving it loving care 60 years ago.</p><p>Floyd died in 1981 and Frances in 2001, just before her 88th birthday.</p><p>Seventy years after the Emery sisters established their Bee Farm, an examination of the buildings revealed their deteriorating condition. Comprehensive restoration was completed in 2001, co-funded by B.C. Parks and the Friends of Wells Gray Park. The project was partly finished when the Friends organized an interpretive hike to the Bee Farm in July 2001. Joining the group were all four of Frances' children (the first time they had been there as adults) and two of Jessie's children, a remarkable family reunion.</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-3932933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y03-H6M1-JDH1-C1N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1216\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Clearwater Times (N.

Across Ontario, the Government of Canada has invested more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure under the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure. The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work. Central to Canada's Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank. On July 9, 2020, Ontario launched the $150-million Improving Connectivity for Ontario program to fund broadband and cellular infrastructure projects where there is a need for better service. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.</p><p>Related product</p><p>Backgrounder</p><p>Canada and Ontario invest in roads and an airport runway for rural communities in Northern Ontario</p><p>Joint federal, provincial, municipal and First Nations funding through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan will support six road projects and one airport runway project in Northern Ontario.

They're stopping by the grocery store on their way home from the airport. They're getting together with friends after being away for March break. This kind of conduct is not just disappointing, it's dangerous. Our focus right now is on recognizing that we are not in the recovery phase yet. We are not even fully into the restarting phase yet. We are still in the emergency phase where people need to get the support they need to they can continue to socially distance. We have said this from the very beginning that our government will be there to support Canadians in need, and people can be reassured that we will continue to be there.</p><p>NAPIER: To wrap up the season, we're dishing out the last of our report cards. Today, we're putting the prime minister in the hot seat. How has Justin Trudeau fared during the pandemic? Does his leadership warrant a passing or failing grade? Our Press Gallery judges return. CTV's Rachel Aiello is here as is CTV's Molly Thomas. And the Globe and Mail's Ian Bailey is also here. Sorry, Ian, I didn't mean for you to leave earlier. So we have to start and we've got to go through a lot. So I want to give, we want to start with the grade for economic response, that's the CERB, the wage subsidy, et cetera, all the economic response. Let's start with you, Molly.</p><p>MOLLY THOMAS (CTV News): Really, really loved it and held on to it. Listen, the government was hoping that people would wean onto that wage subsidy. It hasn't had the up tick that everyone had hoped. So I think that kind of weighs against it a little bit. It's like one program's working really well. The other one isn't. And then I would, you know, criticize the Trudeau government a bit on announcing too early some of the programs, right? We heard about the wage subsidy. We waited weeks for that. We heard about seniors. We waited months for that. We talked about students. We, you know, people that couldn't pay their bills were wondering when this program was actually going to roll out, when the money was going to start to rolling forward. So, for all of that I will give them a B. But lots of money out there, so it's still good.</p><p>NAPIER: A B. Ian, what's your grade?</p><p>IAN BAILEY (The Globe and Mail): Well, I'm going to, sort of, I'm not a teacher but this week it feels like we're in that period and sort of (inaudible) when the teacher says 30 minutes left to, before you have to put down your pens or finish the exam. Look, I want to see the financial update on July 8th before I can give these guys a grade. The money did go out the door for all these programs and (inaudible) Canadians. But I want to see the bill. I want to see the details before I can give a grade so I'm going to have to give them a bit of an incomplete at this point on this (inaudible).</p><p>NAPIER: Yeah, a work in progress for Ian. Rachel, do you have a grade or do you want to wait?</p><p>RACHEL AIELLO (CTV News): I do have a grade, although I think I've been a little bit more generous, but within the same critiques as my colleagues. My parents wanted me to be a teacher. So thank you for giving me this opportunity. A-minus would be my grade to the government on this, just from the sense of, it seems that they have tried to take an approach of putting out the fires wherever they came up. We saw things for small businesses, direct income for people outs of work and large companies, as well. Like Ian said, they need to, if I was a teacher, say, show their work. We haven't seen that yet and that's what we will get in this, hopefully, we will get in this fiscal snapshot. The other thing is something, again Molly touched on it, but the slow rollout of this. So, I would say that they were a little tardy handing in their homework. You can promise things, you know, (inaudible) the report's coming but we don't actually see it for months, weeks at least. So I think that's been one of their biggest downfalls here.</p><p>NAPIER: So let's move to health. So there was the lockdown, the borders, washing your hands, social distancing, masks, no masks. There was maybe, you know, a little bit of incoherence between the federal, the provinces, the regions. Ian, do you have a grade for the health response?</p><p>BAILEY: Rachel just used the analogy of fire and it feels like we are still in a forest fire. We don't get a lot of those here in BC, so that's a challenge. I know that here in BC, the government wanted that border lockdown early on. It took some time. So again, I think we have to wait and see how this, especially with the prospect of a second wave, how things get a bit further before giving the grade, so I'm going to give another incomplete here until we kind of get a little bit further through this pandemic (inaudible).</p><p>NAPIER: I sense that Ian doesn't want to make any enemies in this show. But I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It's sorts sort of like we're still in it, but we've got to grade them, or at least, you know, we can grade so far. Rachel, do you have a grade?</p><p>AIELLO: Yeah, I guess we could call it their mid-term. So here on the health file, I gave them a B. I think this has been where they've struggled more necessarily than responding economically. We saw they were slow to move on a lot of measures that a lot of people have said, well, that could've saved the initial spread from amplifying in the way it did. There was some miscommunication and, you know, changing messaging on masks, the fact that we didn't have PPE stocked up and ready to go. So I think there is a lot left to be desired. And I'm really curious to see when the bigger accountability conversation starts to happen on this, because do far, they've pretty much shelved off responsibility to the provinces, and said, you know, we're going to help them now because they were behind, but you're the federal government. And Joyce, I don't know if you remember, but probably the last time I was with you in studio, you were having a conversation about how the government was saying they had learned from SARS, and sure some of the things have been taken from those reports but I'm not sure exactly that they learned all the lessons that they reassured us so strongly that they had.</p><p>NAPIER: Well, I'm not sure that they learned the lessons from SARS seeing how few PPEs we had when we needed them at first, especially for our frontline workers. Molly, what's your grade?</p><p>THOMAS: I give them a C for confusion city. It was very confusing off the top. You know, lockdown, social distancing, bubbling, people were confused, masks (inaudible) like Aiello had pointed out, you know, it was so confusing. Do I wear a mask? Do I not? I think we're still asking that question in this country. And then my biggest point to that C is really long-term care. Listen, this is provincial jurisdiction. However, for years and decades there have been people raising the alarm in this country saying there's a problem in long-term care. The federal government has to pay attention and right now, the latest report I read that we are twice the rate of deaths in long-term care than other developed nations around the world. That is a shame on provincial governments and the federal government.</p><p>NAPIER: Well, now, it's overall grade but we don't have a lot of time so we're going to go real fast around the table. Ian, I'm going to go to you. Do you have a mid-term all around grade for Trudeau?</p><p>BAILEY: I'm going to stick with the incomplete at this point.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NAPIER: Okay. Molly?</p><p>THOMAS: I'll go B-minus. Trudeau rolled out some of the biggest programs in Canadian history. I'll give him credit for that. I'll give him credit for showing up every day, talking to journalists. He didn't always answer the questions. Canadians get a taste for what we go through every day. But at the end of the day, he did provide some of these big, huge programs. B-minus for Trudeau.</p><p>NAPIER: Rachel Aiello, your final grade for Justin Trudeau.</p><p>AIELLO: I would go with Molly, with a B-minus. The big question mark is still the second wave. I would say, overall, again, I would agree with Ian, this is an incomplete. We don't yet. This is probably the midway point. But how they respond to the second wave, if it should come, will be the real test because they could say this was unprecedented and nobody saw this coming, but we've all been talking about the second wave for months. So, if it happens, they better get every single response right. Otherwise there's going to be real serious questions.</p><p>NAPIER: And very bad grades, obviously. Ian Bailey, Molly Thomas and Rachel Aiello, thanks so much for joining us on our last show. Have a great weekend and have a great summer.</p><p>BAILEY: Thank you.</p><p>THOMAS: Bye-bye.</p><p>NAPIER: And that's your \"Power Play\" day in politics and our final show for the summer. Thank you for choosing to be here with us during these unprecedented times. I would like to take a moment to thank the team behind the camera that brings the show together every day. Our crews here in Ottawa and in Toronto and our producers, Rachel Swatek, Michael del Monte, Rachel Gilmore and Sarah Turnbull. Thank you guys, from the bottom of my heart. And to you, who are watching us, have a safe and happy summer, and we'll see you again in September.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B0-9JD1-DYX2-94BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTV Televisions, Inc.

W. Fitch was broken into and robbed of two suitcases, two five pound boxes of chocolates, several boxes of sardines and costlier groceries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The thief gained access to the building by breaking in one of the windows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As yet no direct evidence has been found that can be used to trace the guilty party. However, the police have discovered one of the suitcases and some other articles down at one of the ranches near here, so it is likely the hobo who left these things there will soon be traced down and brought to justice.</p><p>Our town has been infested with tramps of late and petty thieving has been carried on for some time past, so it is to be hoped that the police will be successful in their investigations.</p><p>On Friday night last the Kootenay hotel was robbed of some $17 in bank bills. It seems that. Mr. Bremner, the proprietor of the hotel, was uneasy, as he had given a room to a man of doubtless character, so he decided to beep a watch around until a late hour.</p><p>He and a number of other men sat in the office until about three a.m. the following morning. He then went into the bar room to empty the till and discovered that, he had been robbed of about $I7.00 in bills. The silver was left untouched.</p><p>The robbery must have taken place between 12 a.m. and 3 p.m. the following morning and in the room just adjoining the office, where Mr. Bremner and his friends were sitting.</p><p>Wolf/dog cross &amp;#x26;#8230; Frank Dunn has received the pelt of a wolf which was killed near Crows Nest. It is supposed to be half dog and reports state that there are a large number of these animals roaming in that district which are beginning to prove a menace to the stockmen and an effort is being made by the hunters to have them exterminated.</p><p>The pelt shows that the wolf was of a very large size with a true wolf's head but it is marked with white patches, which proves that it was crossed with a dog.</p><p>Basketball &amp;#x26;#8230; Cranbrook bankers proved themselves a strong aggregation of basketball players in the game with Wycliffe last Friday evening, winning the game 35&amp; -10. It was an interesting exhibition played in the new club house before a large crowd of spectators. The boys from this city motored up. Those representing Cranbrook were; McEwen and Mackersy, defense; Ashworth, center, Shatford and Mclllwaine, forwards.</p><p>Moyie typhoid &amp;amp; recovering &amp;#x26;#8230; Mrs. Nordine went to Cranbrook on Thursday last with her son Harold who has been ill for some time. Harold was left in the hospital for treatment and the doctor in charge of the case pronounced it typhoid fever. However, the treatment he had received here was just what he required, so the attack will not be as severe as might otherwise have been expected.</p><p>Mrs. Nordine returned on Saturday.</p><p>Mrs. Pearson, who has been in Cranbrook with her little son Oscar who is in the hospital there, returned home on Thursday. She returned to Cranbrook immediately, however, as the child was not expected to recover. The latest report is that Oscar, who is suffering from pneumonia, has taken a change for the better and is now slowly recovering.</p><p>City council &amp;#x26;#8230; City council met at the city hall in regular session on Monday afternoon at 2 p.m. Present Mayor Bowness, Aldermen Ward, Clapp, Carr and Kennedy, City Clerk T. M. Roberts, City Engineer F. O'Hara. Minutes of previous meetings were read and approved.</p><p>W. B. Bardgett appeared before the council with a complaint, regarding the dumping of sewerage water from the Cranbrook Steam Laundry into the creek, and on motion the city clerk was instructed to notify Mr. Davis, the proprietor, to connect with the sewer at once, on account of the many complaints heard in regard to this matter.</p><p>Post office bell &amp;#x26;#8230; Raworth Bros, have the new bell on the post office tower in working condition and it tolls the hours night and day and serves to remind the late sleeper in the early morning hours that it is time to be up and doing. The large clock in the tower is being made use of by the hurried citizen and the banks report that merchants are meeting their drafts better since the new clock was installed.</p><p>Fall clothing styles &amp;#x26;#8230; For morning wear the jumper is much in evidence. Fashion dictates that the stylish cut should be short sack effect with one button, a wire nail and a piece of twine.</p><p>The lapels should be soiled, as last season, and the grease spots are being worn larger and more irregular in shape.</p><p>If one elbow is to be worn through, it should be the left one, as the old style of having holes in both has practically disappeared.</p><p>The trousers should be of blue bedticking with one leg thirty inches long and the other thirty-four.</p><p>Bagging at the knees is a chic as ever and torn places should be V shaped.</p><p>Fringed at the bottom is very popular and trousers should be creased horizontally around and around the leg in irregular wrinkles.</p><p>Shoes should be soaked in cutting compound or any dirty oil and rubbed with iron rust or red lead in prominent spots. Holes should be bored in the uppers in order that the stocking foot may protrude and catch any drip oil from the lathes, automatics, etc.</p><p>Of course the modern shoe lace will still be made from rawhide belt lacing.</p><p>For headdress, straw hats will be very popular this winter. They should be spotted with any good grease or \"hair oil\" minus the band, and may be worn with or without the brim.</p><p>Neckties can be worn this season, but they are not necessary. If worn they may be used either as belt or suspenders.</p><p>Pocket handkerchiefs will be carried in the hip pocket with the monkey wrench, and should be of dark brown waste.</p><p>For evening wear (if you have a night shift) the fashionable dresser will wear one tan shoe and one black.</p><p>The oiled straw hat and jumper coat still remain popular, but all the grease spots and holes should be well rounded and rubbed with iron filings.</p><p>Own a herd &amp;#x26;#8230; Twenty-one head of Ayrshire grade cows, bred and due to calve before spring, and fourteen two-year-olds, are being sold today at public auction at the exhibition grounds by James Arnold, auctioneer. The sale is being conducted by the livestock branch of the department of agriculture and is the first sale of its kind to be conducted in this district. The sale is strictly bona fide without reservation and is for cash. The stock have all been carefully selected and are all tuberculin tested.</p><p>Feature attractions this week &amp;#x26;#8230; The Allen Players in \"The Dawn of a Tomorrow.\" Once in many theatrical moons there is produced a really great play, one that rises above the mere purpose of entertaining and sends forth a message thrilling with hope and inspiration &amp; - a play which ministers can recommend, as presenting with more vivid impressiveness than they can effect, some of those fundamental truths which form the basis of right living and thinking.</p><p>Such a play is \"The Dawn of a Tomorrow,\" with its message entrusted to a little waif of the London slums. \"Glad\" she is called, pathetic in her world-wisdom, wonderful in her philosophy of cheerfulness. She is a fiery young pagan, fighting for her very existence. But her soul is flooded with human love and understanding, that tinges the world about her and finally flames into the light of perfect faith.</p><p>The East End with its poverty of necessities, the West End with its poverty of happiness, are the two extremes pictured in the play. \"Glad\" bridges the gulf between them and opened up a vast field for mutual help and compensation.</p><p>\"The Dawn of a Tomorrow\" does not lecture, nor is it pedantic in treatment. It simply presents a powerful story with such realism that its purport can escape no one. Advocating as it does the doctrine of cheerfulness, its seriousness is often veiled with laughter.</p><p>Miss Felton may have \"greater\" roles in her repertoire than \"Glad\" but surely none more fascinating, nor farther reaching than this little cockney.</p><p>The full strength of the Allen Players is demanded by this production, and appreciating as they do the power of the play, none of their energy is misdirected.</p><p>\"The Dawn of a Tomorrow\" will be presented by the Allen Players at the Auditorium tomorrow night.</p><p>Married &amp;#x26;#8230; Frank Leslie Parks and Miss Josephine Harrison Rogers were quietly married at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Geo. B. Powell on Garden Avenue Wednesday, afternoon, November 12th, at 1.30 o'clock by Rev. W. K. Thomson, pastor of Knox Presbyterian church. Miss Florence Belau and Mr. G. B. Brown were the only invited guests.</p><p>The newly married couple left on the afternoon train for Spokane and from there will visit in Illinois, returning home by way of California, spending a month on their honeymoon.</p><p>The groom is the proprietor of the hardware store of F. Parks and Co. and is an old timer in Cranbrook. The bride came to Cranbrook about a year ago. They will reside on Pooley Avenue.</p><p>Dr. King recognized &amp;#x26;#8230; Dr. J. H. King departed last Friday for Chicago to attend a five day clinic of the surgeons of the United States and Canada.</p><p>About a year ago a meeting of the leading surgeons of the United States met in Washington, D.C., and decided to form an organization to be known as the College of American Surgeons and to confer their degrees upon representatives from every state in the union and each province in Canada.</p><p>Their degree will be equal to the F. C. S. of London and is an honor, not only to Dr. King, but one in which the city of Cranbrook may share.</p><p>The fact that this distinguished citizen has been called to share in this honor is a matter which should be a source of pride to every citizen of this town.</p><p>There were only six surgeons chosen from the province of British Columbia and as this year marks the beginning of this organization, Dr. King will be enrolled as one of the founders.</p><p>The Herald wishes to join his many friends in the city in congratulations for the well-deserved honors which have fallen to him.</p><p>Dr. King has been a successful practising physician in this city for the past several years and has set a high mark for his profession. There is probably no better known man in East Kootenay and many residents of the district today owe their lives to his knowledge and skill. He stands pre-eminently in the front rank of the surgeons of Western Canada.</p><p>Above and beyond any degree which he may secure, he possesses the confidence and esteem of those who know him as a man of sterling integrity of character, and a lasting mark more valuable than insignia of degree or rank built through years of toil and service, lives in the hearts of his Cranbrook friends.</p><p>Above: Dr. J.H. King</p><p>CPR ruling &amp;#x26;#8230; The Supreme Court of Canada has given judgment in the fire cases brought against the Canadian Pacific Railway company by James T.

Macdonald, of the firm Harvey, McCarter, Macdonald Nisbet, Cranbrook, appeared for the different plaintiffs.</p><p>Publicity is keynote &amp;#x26;#8230; As proud of Kootenay and as much delighted with every fresh evidence of growth as a young father with his son and heir, F. E. Simpson, former proprietor of the Cranbrook Herald and a pioneer newspaper man of the interior, reached Nelson last night on the coast train and registered at the Hume.</p><p>\"Dad\" Simpson would rather talk of Kootenay or of British Columbia as a whole than eat, and, he sees a new, greater and more wonderful future for this country every time he visits it. Two years ago he went to England and was so anxious to talk British Columbia that he used to stand outside the railway offices in Charing Cross and expound to the crowds of prospective settlers the possibilities and opportunities of this province.</p><p>He has recently returned from a six weeks' visit to the United States and while there found no difficulty in frequently getting together a crowd of men eager to learn of British Columbia. Nearly everyone seemed to be interested in the Dominion.</p><p>Mr. Simpson states that he has now retired from business and has settled down at Victoria, The capital city is recovering rapidly from the effects of the financial stringency, the large outlay on such works as the new breakwater, railway terminals, the $1,000,000 Hudson Bay building and other improvements doing much to keep the city in its normal condition of activity.</p><p>Baptists celebrate anniversary &amp;#x26;#8230; Special services were held at the Baptist Church last Sunday in commemoration of the anniversary of the church. A special anthem by the choir and a quartette were the features of the evening service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-4074614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618G-PBF1-JDH1-C3JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

Mr. Hanson's technical expertise is a key addition to the existing Universal technical team.</p><p>Clive Massey, Universal Copper's CEO, stated: \"As demonstrated, the Company had a very successful 2019 both project wise and corporately. I would like to extend our sincere thanks to our suppliers, contractors, partners and most importantly to our shareholders, for their cooperation and understanding in these unprecedented times. We look forward to getting back in the field and moving the Company forward.\"</p><p>The Year in Review:</p><p>Universal Copper Closes Ft and NFT Private Placements for Proceeds Of $690,325</p><p>As previously announced in April 15, 2019 news release, the Company closed its private placements of Non Flow Through Units (each \"NFT Unit\") and Flow Through Units (each a \"FT Unit\"), receiving subscriptions for aggregate gross proceeds of $690,325.</p><p>Universal Copper Appoints Wesley Hanson To Its Board of Directors</p><p>The Company announced on May 1, 2019 news release, the appointment of Wesley Hanson to its Board of Directors. Mr. Hanson has held several senior positions in the mining sector bringing to the Board over 32 years of industry experience in exploration, mine development, mine operations, project evaluation and financing including direct involvement in the engineering, construction and commissioning of numerous mining projects in Canada, the US, Brazil, Chile and Russia. Mr. Hanson is a Professional Geologist and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology from Mount Allison University in 1982. The Company intends to further strengthen the Board of Directors, in due course.</p><p>Universal Commences 2019 Exploration Poplar Copper Property</p><p>The Company announced on June 11, 2019 news release, the commencement of its 2019 exploration program at its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia. Prior to executing the 2019 drilling program, Universal undertook a ground survey to evaluate several peripheral gold targets identified during historic exploration programs and/or by the 2018 Long Wave InfraRed Survey. The program consisted of prospecting, mapping, soil and rock sampling concentrating in the western portion of the property where last year's forest fire should provide new outcrop exposure in a number of the target areas. The Company developed multiple drill targets as a result of this exploration program.</p><p>Universal Copper Receives TSX Venture Exchange Approval to Amend Poplar Property Agreement</p><p>The Company announced on July 22, 2019 news release, that the Company received TSX Venture Exchange approval to amend the Poplar Property Option to purchase agreement with the Vendor whereby the Company and the Vendor have agreed to extend the time in which the Company has to fulfill its obligations (the \"Poplar Agreement\"). As a result, the Company has the option to acquire a 100% ownership of 81 mineral titles (the \"Poplar Property\") from the Vendor whereby Universal Copper can earn a 100% interest, subject to legacy NSR interests ranging from 1% to 2%, in the Poplar Property by completing the share issuances, exploration expenditures and cash payments to the Vendor.</p><p>Universal Commences 2019 Drilling on Poplar Property</p><p>The Company announced on August 20, 2019 news release, the commencement of the 2019 drilling campaign at its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia. The purpose of this program will be to expand the known copper deposit to depth, and the initial drill campaign will encompass a 550 metre vertical hole. Additional holes are in the planning stages.</p><p>Universal Intersects 257.61 M Of 0.488% Copper Within 394.82 M At 0.413% Copper at Poplar Property</p><p>The Company announced on October 16, 2019 news release, release the results from Drill Hole (\"19-PC-129\") from its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia.</p><p>The purpose of 19-PC-129, drilled at an angle of -80o, was to test the main Poplar deposit to depth. The hole was successful with continuous copper mineralization from 48.8 metres through to a major shear zone fault at 538 metres.</p><p>The full interval averaged 0.362 % copper over 489.2 metres with a higher-grade interval of 0.488% copper between 230.36 metres and 487.97 metres within a larger interval of 0.413% copper between 143.18 and 538 metres. The hole was terminated at 551 metres on the other side of the shear zone fault. Further exploration needs to focus on locating the copper mineralization below the fault.</p><p>About the Poplar</p><p>The Poplar copper deposit hosts an historical indicated mineral resource of 131 million tonnes grading 0.31 per cent copper, 0.009 per cent molybdenum, 0.09 gram per tonne gold and 2.39 grams per tonne silver, and a historical inferred mineral resource of 132 million tonnes grading 0.27 per cent Cu, 0.005 per cent Mo, 0.07 g/t Au and 3.75 g/t Ag has been identified through the drilling of 147 historical holes.</p><p>These historical indicated and inferred resources were disclosed by Lions Gate Metals Inc. in its technical report dated March 30, 2012, prepared by Gary Giroux, PEng.</p><p>To determine the historical resource, a 3-D solid was constructed to constrain the mineralized area, using a 0.1-per-cent-copper-grade shell as a guide. Large internal waste zones were modelled as were some larger-post mineral dikes. Of the total database, 129 drill holes totalling 37,205 metres were within the mineralized zone and were used to estimate the resource. Drill holes were compared with the mineralized solid, and assays were tagged if inside. Copper, molybdenum, gold and silver assays within the mineralized solid were capped at 1.4 per cent Cu, 0.14 per cent Mo, 0.34 g/t Au and 41 g/t Ag, respectively. Five-metre composites were formed and used for variography.</p><p>For this estimate and to aid with some preliminary planning, the blocks were reduced to five by five by 10 metres in dimension and were estimated for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag by ordinary kriging. The historical resource is classified as indicated and inferred based on each block's proximity to data and the grade continuity. The historical indicated and historical inferred resource uses the categories set out in Section 1.2 of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>Universal will need to review and verify the historical drilling database and twin a number of the existing drill holes to bring the historical resources current. Investors are cautioned a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and therefore Universal is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>R. Tim Henneberry, P.Geo. (BC) and Universal Copper's geologist, is the Qualified Person who has reviewed and approved the technical content of this news release.</p><p>For additional information, please visit the Company's website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.universalcopper.com\">www.universalcopper.com</url></p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p><p>\"Clive Massey\"</p><p>Clive H.

(\"Universal Copper\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update for current and prospective Shareholders regarding the Company's 2019 exploration activities and milestones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2019 was a busy and successful year for Universal Copper with exploration efforts focussed on the Houston, B.C. Poplar copper-gold project and through its joint venture partner on the Princeton, B.C. gold project. In addition, the Company's technical team continued to review domestic and international projects with the aim of increasing the Company's copper and gold exposure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Universal also made a significant technical addition with Mr. Wesley Hansen joining the Board of Directors. All Universal employees and contractors are working at home during the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The health and safety of our personnel and the wellbeing of the public is always paramount.</p><p>Poplar</p><p>The Company continued to expand the copper deposit footprint with a deep 538 metre drill hole to compliment its 2018 drill program. These holes have confirmed the historic drilling data and expanded the mineralization at depth.</p><p>* 19-PC-129 intersected 257.61 metres at 0.488% copper within a 394.82 interval grading 0.413% copper. Complete details of the intersection can be found in the 16-Oct-2019 news release.</p><p>* 18-PC-126 intersected 380.97 metres at 0.365% copper, 18-PC-127 intersected 264.86 metres grading 0.421% copper and 18-PC-128 intersected intervals of 151.1 metres at 0.330% copper and 71.0 metres at 0.373% copper. Complete details of the intersection can be found in the 22-Jan-2019 news release.</p><p>The Company has also completed a Long Wave InfraRed (LWIR) survey over the entire 62,000 hectare claim block and follow up ground surveys on both historic occurrences and newly identified anomalies. Universal's technical team is commencing planning for the 2020 exploration season.</p><p>Princeton</p><p>Through its joint venture partner Canarc Resources Corp., exploration continued at the Princeton Gold project, where Universal's 2018 exploration returned 219 g/t gold over 0.9 metres and 99.7 g/t gold over 0.9 metres from bedrock trenching of quartz veins. (See UNV 10-Jan-2019 news release).</p><p>* The 2018 property wide airborne geophysical survey identified several linear trends</p><p>* 2019 trenching extended the known vein system to 235 metres before the veining trending under thick overburden. Highlights included 44.2 g/t Au over 1.6 metres. The trenching help better define priority targets for drilling.</p><p>Board of Directors</p><p>Mr. Wesley Hanson joined the Board of Directors 01-May-2019. A Professional Geoscientist, Mr. Hanson has over 32 years of domestic and international exploration, mine development and mine operations experience. Highlights include: Director Technical Services for Kinross Gold (2002 to 2006), President and CEO for Noront Resources (2009 to 2012). Mr. Hanson's technical expertise is a key addition to the existing Universal technical team.</p><p>Clive Massey, Universal Copper's CEO, stated: \"As demonstrated, the Company had a very successful 2019 both project wise and corporately. I would like to extend our sincere thanks to our suppliers, contractors, partners and most importantly to our shareholders, for their cooperation and understanding in these unprecedented times. We look forward to getting back in the field and moving the Company forward.\"</p><p>The Year in Review:</p><p>Universal Copper Closes Ft and NFT Private Placements for Proceeds Of $690,325</p><p>As previously announced in April 15, 2019 news release, the Company closed its private placements of Non Flow Through Units (each \"NFT Unit\") and Flow Through Units (each a \"FT Unit\"), receiving subscriptions for aggregate gross proceeds of $690,325.</p><p>Universal Copper Appoints Wesley Hanson To Its Board of Directors</p><p>The Company announced on May 1, 2019 news release, the appointment of Wesley Hanson to its Board of Directors. Mr. Hanson has held several senior positions in the mining sector bringing to the Board over 32 years of industry experience in exploration, mine development, mine operations, project evaluation and financing including direct involvement in the engineering, construction and commissioning of numerous mining projects in Canada, the US, Brazil, Chile and Russia. Mr. Hanson is a Professional Geologist and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology from Mount Allison University in 1982. The Company intends to further strengthen the Board of Directors, in due course.</p><p>Universal Commences 2019 Exploration Poplar Copper Property</p><p>The Company announced on June 11, 2019 news release, the commencement of its 2019 exploration program at its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia. Prior to executing the 2019 drilling program, Universal undertook a ground survey to evaluate several peripheral gold targets identified during historic exploration programs and/or by the 2018 Long Wave InfraRed Survey. The program consisted of prospecting, mapping, soil and rock sampling concentrating in the western portion of the property where last year's forest fire should provide new outcrop exposure in a number of the target areas. The Company developed multiple drill targets as a result of this exploration program.</p><p>Universal Copper Receives TSX Venture Exchange Approval to Amend Poplar Property Agreement</p><p>The Company announced on July 22, 2019 news release, that the Company received TSX Venture Exchange approval to amend the Poplar Property Option to purchase agreement with the Vendor whereby the Company and the Vendor have agreed to extend the time in which the Company has to fulfill its obligations (the \"Poplar Agreement\"). As a result, the Company has the option to acquire a 100% ownership of 81 mineral titles (the \"Poplar Property\") from the Vendor whereby Universal Copper can earn a 100% interest, subject to legacy NSR interests ranging from 1% to 2%, in the Poplar Property by completing the share issuances, exploration expenditures and cash payments to the Vendor.</p><p>Universal Commences 2019 Drilling on Poplar Property</p><p>The Company announced on August 20, 2019 news release, the commencement of the 2019 drilling campaign at its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia. The purpose of this program will be to expand the known copper deposit to depth, and the initial drill campaign will encompass a 550 metre vertical hole. Additional holes are in the planning stages.</p><p>Universal Intersects 257.61 M Of 0.488% Copper Within 394.82 M At 0.413% Copper at Poplar Property</p><p>The Company announced on October 16, 2019 news release, release the results from Drill Hole (\"19-PC-129\") from its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia.</p><p>The purpose of 19-PC-129, drilled at an angle of -80o, was to test the main Poplar deposit to depth. The hole was successful with continuous copper mineralization from 48.8 metres through to a major shear zone fault at 538 metres.</p><p>The full interval averaged 0.362 % copper over 489.2 metres with a higher-grade interval of 0.488% copper between 230.36 metres and 487.97 metres within a larger interval of 0.413% copper between 143.18 and 538 metres. The hole was terminated at 551 metres on the other side of the shear zone fault. Further exploration needs to focus on locating the copper mineralization below the fault.</p><p>About the Poplar</p><p>The Poplar copper deposit hosts an historical indicated mineral resource of 131 million tonnes grading 0.31 per cent copper, 0.009 per cent molybdenum, 0.09 gram per tonne gold and 2.39 grams per tonne silver, and a historical inferred mineral resource of 132 million tonnes grading 0.27 per cent Cu, 0.005 per cent Mo, 0.07 g/t Au and 3.75 g/t Ag has been identified through the drilling of 147 historical holes.</p><p>These historical indicated and inferred resources were disclosed by Lions Gate Metals Inc. in its technical report dated March 30, 2012, prepared by Gary Giroux, PEng.</p><p>To determine the historical resource, a 3-D solid was constructed to constrain the mineralized area, using a 0.1-per-cent-copper-grade shell as a guide. Large internal waste zones were modelled as were some larger-post mineral dikes. Of the total database, 129 drill holes totalling 37,205 metres were within the mineralized zone and were used to estimate the resource. Drill holes were compared with the mineralized solid, and assays were tagged if inside. Copper, molybdenum, gold and silver assays within the mineralized solid were capped at 1.4 per cent Cu, 0.14 per cent Mo, 0.34 g/t Au and 41 g/t Ag, respectively. Five-metre composites were formed and used for variography.</p><p>For this estimate and to aid with some preliminary planning, the blocks were reduced to five by five by 10 metres in dimension and were estimated for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag by ordinary kriging. The historical resource is classified as indicated and inferred based on each block's proximity to data and the grade continuity. The historical indicated and historical inferred resource uses the categories set out in Section 1.2 of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>Universal will need to review and verify the historical drilling database and twin a number of the existing drill holes to bring the historical resources current. Investors are cautioned a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and therefore Universal is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>R. Tim Henneberry, P.Geo. (BC) and Universal Copper's geologist, is the Qualified Person who has reviewed and approved the technical content of this news release.</p><p>For additional information, please visit the Company's website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.universalcopper.com\">www.universalcopper.com</url></p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p><p>\"Clive Massey\"</p><p>Clive H.

Following a pay-as-you-go policy that closely watched spending and transferred debts to provincial agencies, he claimed in 1959 that the province was free of debt. Bennett resigned in 1972 after losing to the NDP under David Barrett. Barrett was later succeeded by Bennett's son, Bill Bennett.</p><p>In 1957, the North American Air Defence Agreement was announced.

It's an expensive way to keep warm and comes with a hefty greenhouse gas footprint: heating accounts for nearly a quarter of the territory's total emissions and over half of the corporate emissions from the Yukon Government itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As part of Yukon's new climate strategy, released in September, that costly over-reliance on fossil fuels for heating will be reduced, in part, by turning to the burning of biomass, essentially wood and wood waste leftover from wildfires and logging operations. Heating with cordwood, bulk pellets or wood chips can cost 50 per cent less than using fossil fuels or electricity, according to Yukon's 2016 biomass energy strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet a reliance on wood for heating is raising concern for environmental advocates who say so-called 'clean' biofuels can threaten forests while contributing to air pollution and climate change.</p><p>The thought of turning forests into biofuel for heating sets alarm bells ringing in the mind of Donald Reid, a conservation zoologist with Wildlife Conservation Society Canada.</p><p>\"It's the traditional set of concerns that go along with logging mature forests in any jurisdiction,\" he said. Clearcut logging can threaten biodiversity and potentially damage moose, caribou and marten habitats, he added.</p><p>While the Yukon climate strategy states the territory will use \"local, sustainably harvested biomass,\" Reid said the government hasn't indicated where wood will be sourced to support an increase in the use of wood for heat. If new logging is going to be taking place near wildlife habitat, roadbuilding can open the gates to an increase in hunting, adding yet another stressor on wildlife, he said.</p><p>\"It has to be made clearer to the Yukon public that this is going to happen. We need more transparency on that wood supply.\"</p><p>Reid also said he is suspicious of the government's claims that the use of biomass will help support the wood products industry through Yukon's FireSmart program that removes fuel from forest floors.</p><p>Reid said positioning biomass use as a means of wildfire prevention is a \"red herring\" because the amount of wood gathered in those activities would be marginal.</p><p>As part of the climate strategy, the Yukon government plans to install 20 commercial and institutional biomass heating systems by 2030 and is supporting the increased development of biomass systems in First Nations communities.</p><p>\"The wood from fire smarting will never be sufficient,\" Reid said. \"They're not going to provide enough fuel supply for large-scale biomass.\" While dead wood salvaged from old forest fires could be used, Reid said he is concerned these burns are too far from towns that will become reliant on biomass.</p><p>\"Ultimately they're going to be going into the green wood [intact] forests and clear-cutting stands in order to burn them.\"</p><p>B.C. recently raised the ire of conservation groups after permitting the logging of old-growth forests for biomass products destined to be shipped overseas. Despite plans to use wood waste, B.C. biomass producers also use whole logs sourced from clearcuts located in caribou habitat, as The Narwhal reported in April.</p><p>Lisa Walker, the director of the Yukon forestry branch at Energy, Mines and Resources, said trees will continue to be harvested from intact forests, old burns and through FireSmart efforts, many of which will go hand-in-hand with a variety of land use activities, including clearing land for new development or roads.</p><p>Walker said that while wood from intact forests is already harvested in almost every region in Yukon - from Whitehorse to Dawson City - that material is used to create value-added products like furniture. But there's always material left over and that's what the Yukon government is going to use as a heat source for certain buildings, she said. She noted the majority of the wood that is used for heating is harvested as dead wood.</p><p>Reid's concerns about keeping forests intact hinge on an increase in demand for biomass products. But Walker said that the Yukon government has regulations that limit how much wood can be harvested any given year.</p><p>\"We can only harvest what is written into legislation,\" she said, adding that there are planning processes that indicate where trees can actually be cut down. And, if there's a dip in supply, the Yukon government will import wood for its biomass plans.</p><p>\"It will never get to a level that's unsustainable, because legally we're not allowed to get there.\"</p><p>Until regional management plans are in place, \"harvest levels in each forest region are capped by regulation,\" according to the 2016 biomass energy strategy.</p><p>The extent of harvesting is marginal, with only 0.1 per cent of all forests in Yukon - covering about 38 million hectares - dedicated to wood harvesting, the report states.</p><p>But the report also suggests \"industry can lead the development of new harvest areas through timber harvest planning, with assistance from government to ensure sustainability requirements are met.\"</p><p>Roughly 30,000 cubic metres of wood are harvested in Yukon annually to heat homes and buildings, accounting for about 17 per cent of the territory's total consumption of energy for heat, the report says.</p><p>Myles Thorp, executive director of the Yukon Wood Products Association, told The Narwhal that Yukon has untapped potential for fuel derived from wood that doesn't require felling more trees. That's part of the reason why he's been pressing the Yukon government for years to bolster its biomass plans.</p><p>Wood that doesn't meet firewood grade - the tops of trees or broken pieces - can be used as wood chips to fuel efficient boilers, he said. Instead, they're going to waste by being burned in the bush.</p><p>\"That material is what we're trying to find a market for,\" Thorp said.</p><p>The claim that more mature forests are going to be cut down is \"unfounded,\" he said.</p><p>That's because there isn't going to be much harvesting of trees beyond what's happening right now, especially when FireSmarting efforts are involved in the mix, Thorp said.</p><p>\"[Wildlife Conservation Society Canada] is equating our needs in the Yukon with an industry that doesn't exist here, and it will never exist here,\" he said. \"We're a high-cost producing area and we'll never have a sawmill that'll get into the commodity lumber industry.\"</p><p>Whitehorse and the surrounding area is sitting on a mature, conifer forest that hasn't been harvested in some areas for about 100 years, Thorp said, but warned that the city is also sitting on a tinder box.</p><p>\"We're ready for another major forest fire to run through this area. The FireSmart programs are starting to ramp up and we're saying that timber that's removed has commercial value and it should be converted into firewood, at a minimum, and some wood chips.\"</p><p>Most harvesting in Yukon is for the commercial sale of firewood. That wood typically comes from old burns or diseased trees, Thorp said.</p><p>\"We're actually doing forest renewal because we're taking the dead trees out and you have to replant, even where you logged,\" he said. \"In terms of sustainability, it's not an issue.\"</p><p>As part of its climate strategy, Yukon plans to prioritize biomass heating systems in buildings that have \"significant heating demand\" over the next decade.</p><p>Using large, efficient biomass systems will produce fewer air emissions, the strategy states.</p><p>Yet while the biomass industry claims wood is a form of clean, renewable energy, recent criticism points to the fuel source's overlooked impacts.</p><p>An April report from the environmental organization Stand.earth found that \"at the smokestack, burning wood pellets for power generation is worse than coal in terms of climate pollution.\"</p><p>And yet, the report documents, due to a loophole in the Paris climate accord \"biomass plants do not have to count emissions at the stack, under the premise that emissions are accounted for and offset on the supply side - which is not the case.\"</p><p>According to Shane Andre, the director of the energy branch of Energy, Mines and Resources, the Yukon government tracks emissions produced from biomass fuel sources but does not include them in the territory's total emissions.</p><p>\"We count those numbers, but we don't count them in our emissions totals, because that would be double dipping,\" Andre said. \"We do calculate them sometimes, but we wouldn't report on them.\"</p><p>Andre pointed to two facilities that are already heated with wood sources - the Whitehorse Correctional Centre, which has been heated by wood pellets since 2012, and a wastewater treatment plant in Dawson - where emissions are being tracked.</p><p>In March 2020, Yukon received $2.3 million in federal funds to connect the existing biomass system at the correctional centre in Whitehorse to a young offenders facility and a long term care facility, creating the largest biomass project in Whitehorse. According to a federal press release, the extended system will reduce emissions by 82 per cent, what the government estimates is the equivalent to removing 3,460 cars from the road for one year.</p><p>The Yukon climate strategy includes plans to beef up emissions monitoring efforts across the territory. By 2030, every community will be able to track emissions from biomass use, the strategy states.</p><p>There are also plans to compare the climate benefits of different kinds of biomass by 2021 in order to develop guidelines for \"sustainable and low-carbon biomass use,\" and plans to improve the Forest Resources Act to increase support for Yukon's biomass industry by 2022.</p><p>Air emissions regulations will also be amended to minimize harmful air pollution from commercial and institutional biomass burning systems by 2025.</p><p>A 2018 report from the U.S.-based Partnership for Policy Integrity found that biomass energy facilities are often the recipients of large subsidies but represent high energy costs for ratepayers that cannot beat out cheaper wind and solar options. The analysis also found biomass plants were often in violation of air quality limits and can be a significant source of dangerous sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution.</p><p>Mary Booth, director of the Partnership for Policy Integrity, who's been studying the wood pellet industry for years, said, on the face of it, the problem is simple: biomass generates high volumes of emissions through the process of combustion.</p><p>\"Wood is very comparable to coal, in terms of the amount of carbon attached to the energy,\" she said.</p><p>When wood is pulled from the forest, it can contain upward of 50 per cent water, Booth noted. This is bad news when trying to squeeze energy out of it.</p><p>\"It's hard to get a hot fire out of wet wood, and the reason for that is a lot of the energy is being expended to boil off the water before you can make useful energy,\" she said. \"That's why, per unit of energy, there's more CO2 emissions from burning wood than from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Wood is a very inefficient fuel.\"</p><p>How and where fuel wood is sourced from can mean higher or lower emissions. If wood from slash piles or dead wood is to be used, there will be fewer emissions, Booth said. Start using wood from intact forests, though, and emissions will climb, she said.</p><p>\"If they're burning residues or whatever, it's definitely less bad than if they're cutting more trees,\" she said. \"If your activity of fuel demand is driving additional logging that would not have otherwise happened, then that's going to be a net negative for the atmosphere.\"</p><p>\"Burning trees is something that happens quickly, and trees regrow slowly. There's going to be a net increase in emissions from burning more wood. That's just basic common sense.\"</p><p>The Yukon government's climate change strategy also emphasizes support for First Nations operating biomass systems.</p><p>Long before the territorial government's strategy was released, a number of Yukon First Nations were already turning to biomass to generate local power while also fostering Indigenous stewardship of land and resources.</p><p>The Teslin Tlingit First Nation has been operating biomass boilers to heat 10 of the community's buildings since 2018 and the program, funded with over $1 million from federal and territorial grants, has been seen as a success. A spokesperson with the First Nation wasn't immediately available for comment.</p><p>In September, the Yukon government announced an additional $5.4 million in funds from the federal government aimed at reducing emissions through electric thermal storage heating and biomass energy projects, especially in First Nations' communities</p><p>From that funding, an additional $800,000 will go to the Teslin Tlingit Council and $2.1 million will support a biomass heating system for the Carcross/Tagish First Nation.</p><p>Miles Dean, director of infrastructure for Carcross/Tagish First Nation, said four buildings will draw heat from biomass energy by next winter.</p><p>Wood will be harvested from dead trees primarily, but intact forests could eventually be logging in areas where the First Nation's land claims have been settled, Dean said, adding that there could be plans to make a new subdivision, with wood harvested there being used for biomass efforts.</p><p>\"We're going to move forward and determine what our needs are and will be development plans from here on to ensure we have our required supply of chips,\" he said.</p><p>There could be an additional three buildings heated with biomass in the future, Dean added.</p><p>The Kluane First Nation also received $346,000 from the federal government to create a forest management plan to support the community's existing biomass energy heating system, which was set up in 1999. Through the plan, wood harvesting areas - for both citizens and the First Nation's biomass needs - will be selected, Chief Bob Dickson said in an email to The Narwhal.</p><p>Dickson said the volume of wood that is harvested for biomass efforts represents a small fraction of the surrounding forest.</p><p>\"If forests are managed sustainably by way of maintaining a mix of different ages across the landscape, impacts will be mitigated,\" he said. \"This approach will also contribute to the resiliency of the forest ecosystem.\"</p><p>The First Nation primarily relies on diesel power generation and heating oil, so biomass represents a better solution to steer clear of fossil fuels, Dickson added.</p><p>A spruce beetle outbreak, which peaked in 2004, caused upward of 90 per cent of spruce trees to die in the Kluane region, leading to increased fire risk, he said. If a wildfire occurs in the area, the carbon emissions that would be released would be significant, he added.</p><p>\"An intense fire could negatively impact how the forest regenerates because it burns up the organic soil layer,\" Dickson said. \"For Kluane First Nation, it is really a case of use it or lose it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020102359214484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:614J-S0T1-F103-34Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

In areas such as SouthwestFinland, H\u00e4me and Satakunta, flight numbers were clearly below the long-term average,\u201d Mattila said.  The highest number of flights took place in North Karelia, South Savo, Ostrobothnia and the Sea Lapland region. The lowest were in Southwest Finland, Kanta-H\u00e4me, P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me and Northern Lapland.  The patrols are flown along 22 regular routes. They are launched when the Finnish Meteorological Institute\u2019s forest fire index rises above four. The flights aim to detect wildfires, grass fires and peat production area fires early enough to prevent large-scale spread.  Patrol flights are usually carried out by local aviation clubs or aviation companies under AVI\u2019s coordination. The system has been in place for decades and is considered an integral part of Finland\u2019s wildfire prevention strategy.  From 2026, responsibility for forest fire patrol operations will shift from the Regional State Administrative Agency to the Ministry of the Interior as part of a state administration reform. Officials said the change will not affect service continuity, and patrol flights will continue as before.

Medical officer of health Dr. Eileen de Villa used her legal powers to order new restrictions that would continue until late June, and the city cancelled events until June 30.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what happens next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody is scheduling a parade for July 1. Asked when life will return to normal, \"to give you an exact date, I just can't tell you right now,\" Premier Doug Ford said at Thursday's press briefing.</p><p>Whenever the date does arrive, it won't herald an instant return to pre-pandemic freedoms, warned Toronto Mayor John Tory.</p><p>\"It's not going to be like somebody is going to pull a switch (and) the medical officer of health or the mayor say everything is back to normal right away,\" Tory told CP24 on Thursday.</p><p>Experts acknowledge, however, that severe restrictions will be extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. Aside from the brutal economic costs - more than one million jobs were lost in March, according to Statistics Canada - they worry that compliance will dip as fatigue builds.</p><p>Neither the city nor the province has released a road map for returning to normalcy, for good reason. It's too early to say how close Ontario is to the epidemic peak, and leaders at all levels of government are still hammering home the risks of flouting life-saving restrictions on person-to-person contact.</p><p>Still, researchers here, and governments in other countries, are contemplating a suite of strategies that might allow those restrictions to ease. Here is what might help, what likely won't help, and the risks and pitfalls for each.</p><p>Hot weather</p><p>Let's clear the bad news first: Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's earlier assurances that the virus would just \"go away\" in April when \"the heat comes in,\" COVID-19 is unlikely to give us a summer break.</p><p>Like most of the natural world, infectious diseases do have seasonal cycles. Aside from the obvious winter flu peak, seasonality is a common feature of infectious diseases, including chickenpox (spring), polio (summer), and even sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea (summer).</p><p>Researchers say it's difficult to distinguish between human behaviours that drive up transmission - children packing into enclosed classrooms during the school year, or a summertime uptick in sexual activity - and the inherent biological cycles of a virus or other pathogen.</p><p>But lab experiments on influenza, one of the best-studied infectious diseases, have shown that flu viruses transmit less readily in warm, humid environments than in cold, less humid ones.</p><p>Tantalizingly, given the current crisis, the coronaviruses that cause colds also show a marked spike in wintertime transmission and a nose dive in summer. But a warm-weather decrease in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is unlikely to help us much, researchers say.</p><p>Unlike for flu and cold viruses, the vast majority of the population has no immunity to the novel coronavirus. This huge pool of susceptible people is kindling for the pandemic forest fire.</p><p>\"Seasonality is a main structuring element of our planet,\" says Micaela Martinez, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"We can expect that there will be some seasonal features to SARS-CoV-2. It's just that right now in this pandemic phase, we have such a high fraction of the world's population that is susceptible, that we can't expect that seasonal declines in transmission alone will be able to give us this huge drop.\"</p><p>Any decline we do see shouldn't dupe us into thinking we beat the pandemic. When Canadian researchers modelled the autumn uptick of swine flu in Alberta during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, they found that the reopening of schools in fall had a much larger effect on the surge than cold weather did.</p><p>\"This is a new virus, and we haven't seen it spread in the summer,\" said David Earn, a mathematics professor and member of the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, and a co-author of the Alberta study.</p><p>\"But based on experience with influenza, it seems very unlikely that weather changes could compensate for social distancing measures.\"</p><p>Immunity passports</p><p>Researchers at Sinai Health and the University of Toronto announced this week that a robotic laboratory platform at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI) has the potential to process 10,000 tests daily that can determine who has antibodies to COVID-19, and potentially some level of immune protection.</p><p>The tests are still being fine-tuned, but the ability to carry out antibody testing - also known as serology - on a massive scale is a necessary component for a strategy being contemplated in some European countries: \"immunity passports.\"</p><p>The idea is to identify people carrying antibodies to the novel coronavirus, evidence that their immune system already fought off COVID-19 and they have some level of protection from being reinfected. (These antibody blood tests are different from the typical tests to diagnose the illness, which search for viral genetic material in nose or throat swabs.)</p><p>People with protective antibodies might safely return to work, restoring some parts of the labour force.</p><p>Not surprisingly, a whack of scientific, policy and ethical questions remain.</p><p>Because the virus is still so new, lots of questions persist about immune protection from COVID-19. Are those who already had it completely immune, or merely protected from severe illness but potentially still contagious if reinfected? How long before that immunity wanes? Does everyone produce high levels of antibodies, or just some people?</p><p>Secondly, an antibody test that is 99 per cent accurate would still mean that one in 100 people would wrongly believe they are immune, risking their own health and that of others if they did get a \"pass\" to return to work.</p><p>Equity issues are also a challenge. Who gets the test? If it gives some people a \"passport\" to work and not others, testing would either have to be rolled out across the entire population, or reserved for front-line health workers or those in high-risk settings, like nursing homes and prisons.</p><p>Last week, the World Health Organization warned that rapid-result (non-laboratory) immune tests should only be used in research settings, and not for clinical decision-making until more evidence becomes available.</p><p>The Sinai-U of T research team is still hard at work, but hopes to tackle some of the big science questions first. The lab is certified for research and would need approval for clinical work, and to expand its industrial partners to massively scale up the production of test kits.</p><p>\"No test is perfect,\" notes Jim Woodgett, Koffler Director of Research at LTRI. But people who test positive for antibodies \"can be put into environments where you're not going to infect other people, and you're not going to get infected yourself ... that does open up possibilities,\" particularly for essential services, he said, adding that Germany is already discussing this.</p><p>Digital contact tracing</p><p>The bedrock public health tool kit is the same in any outbreak: test, trace, isolate, repeat. No matter how technologically advanced the country, every nation is engaged in confirming new cases through testing, tracing contacts of those cases to hunt down potential new infections, and isolating people to break chains of transmission.</p><p>Ontario has been justifiably focused on its failure so far to test widely, a lapse that has assured many cases of COVID-19 are going uncounted and untraced. To fight this pandemic to the bitter end, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's top public health official, said Friday that testing must be scaled up across the country.</p><p>Contact tracing has drawn less scrutiny, perhaps because it is more low-tech. Public health staff work phone lines and patients' memories to track down everyone who might have come in contact with known cases, informing those contacts of their risk and telling them to self-isolate.</p><p>A recent study in the prestigious journal Science suggested that manual contact tracing was too slow to catch up to the speed at which the virus is transmitted, and that digital contact tracing - using cellphone location data - would be necessary to stop the pandemic.</p><p>Countries in Asia have already used cellphone location data for digital contact tracing and to find patients who are breaking quarantine orders.</p><p>But in North America, those sensitive to privacy concerns are understandably queasy about sharing an entire population's real-time cellphone location data with the government: \"emergency\" powers are sometimes hard to unwind post-emergency.</p><p>Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, has proposed an artificial intelligence-based app that uses location information and test results to calculate an infectious risk score, but shares that data between phones rather than in a central database.</p><p>\"The problem is, you don't want governments or other, for-profit organizations to build a database knowing where everyone was ... because it could be abused,\" Bengio, a recipient of the Turing Prize and a leader of ethical AI movements, told the Star in March.</p><p>\"It can be done completely in a peer-to-peer way. You don't need to centralize information. If every person has locally the information about the risk they're carrying, and that information only gets shared with the people they cross,\" those concerns can be avoided, Bengio said.</p><p>On Friday, archrival tech giants Apple and Google announced the creation of an opt-in digital contact tracing tool that uses Bluetooth to notify users if they have been in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, raising a new round of questions about privacy, equity, access and much more.</p><p>On-and-off interventions</p><p>Epidemiological modellers - the surprise celebrities of this strange new pandemic world - have demonstrated that physical distancing interventions need to continue for months, not weeks, to bring the size of the COVID-19 outbreak down to a size where it won't sink our health-care system, hastening catastrophic outcomes.</p><p>But modellers in Canada and elsewhere have also examined \"dynamic\" cycling of interventions: pedalling restrictions on and off over an even longer period.</p><p>The goal would be to keep new cases, hospitalizations and deaths to a minimum, but give everyone intermittent psychological and financial breaks.</p><p>A study published this past week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) found that dynamically cycling interventions in Ontario over a 13-month period would reduce the median attack rate for COVID-19 (the percentage of the population infected) to two per cent, would keep ICU capacity from being overwhelmed, and would be more \"palatable,\" the authors suggested, than a single, fixed-duration intervention.</p><p>\"In the dynamic scenario, when you release the physical distancing measures, you're still going to get some amount of transmission in the community,\" says Amy Greer, Canada research chair in population disease modelling at the University of Guelph and a co-author on the CMAJ paper. \"You are, in more of a controlled way, still allowing some amount of immunity to build up in the population.\"</p><p>The model used a certain number of ICU admissions for the intervention \"on\" switch, and Greer said getting that trigger right is crucial - too slow, and we risk another onslaught.</p><p>And \"ultimately, you would still need to be very cognizant of protecting those at most high risk: individuals who are residents of long-term-care homes,\" for example.</p><p>The COVID-19 projections released by the Public Health Agency of Canada on Thursday acknowledged a scenario like this, showing a large first wave of the outbreak and subsequent smaller ones.</p><p>This strategy - and probably any strategy governments eventually adopt - will likely rely on all of the tools. Testing, contact tracing, and other traditional public health tools will need to be scaled up and sharpened to get a clearer view on exactly where disease hotspots are emerging, and contain them quickly. Immunity testing will help researchers calibrate who is still at risk, and how big the size of the first wave was. A hot weather break, even if it doesn't save us, can't hurt.</p><p>In the meantime, everybody has to stick with this new, difficult reality.</p><p>\"If we let up, new chains of transmission will take off in our highly susceptible population and the epidemic will reignite,\" Tam said Thursday.</p><p>\"If we are to not lose our hard-won progress, we must stay the course until we have reached a very low number of cases at the bottom of that first wave.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020041257723369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN2-2N91-JBTY-W1XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2107\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

Medical officer of health Dr. Eileen de Villa used her legal powers to order new restrictions that would continue until late June, and the city cancelled events until June 30.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what happens next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody is scheduling a parade for July 1. Asked when life will return to normal, \"to give you an exact date, I just can't tell you right now,\" Premier Doug Ford said at Thursday's press briefing.</p><p>Whenever the date does arrive, it won't herald an instant return to pre-pandemic freedoms, warned Toronto Mayor John Tory.</p><p>\"It's not going to be like somebody is going to pull a switch (and) the medical officer of health or the mayor say everything is back to normal right away,\" Tory told CP24 on Thursday.</p><p>Experts acknowledge, however, that severe restrictions will be extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. Aside from the brutal economic costs - more than one million jobs were lost in March, according to Statistics Canada - they worry that compliance will dip as fatigue builds.</p><p>Neither the city nor the province has released a road map for returning to normalcy, for good reason. It's too early to say how close Ontario is to the epidemic peak, and leaders at all levels of government are still hammering home the risks of flouting life-saving restrictions on person-to-person contact.</p><p>Still, researchers here, and governments in other countries, are contemplating a suite of strategies that might allow those restrictions to ease. Here is what might help, what likely won't help, and the risks and pitfalls for each.</p><p>Hot weather</p><p>Let's clear the bad news first: despite U.S. President Donald Trump's earlier assurances that the virus would just \"go away\" in April when \"the heat comes in,\" COVID-19 is unlikely to give us a summer break.</p><p>Like most of the natural world, infectious diseases do have seasonal cycles. Aside from the obvious winter flu peak, seasonality is a common feature of infectious diseases, including chickenpox (spring), polio (summer), and even sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea (summer).</p><p>Researchers say it's difficult to distinguish between human behaviours that drive up transmission - children packing into enclosed classrooms during the school year, or a summertime uptick in sexual activity - and the inherent biological cycles of a virus or other pathogen. But lab experiments on influenza, one of the best-studied infectious diseases, has shown that flu viruses transmit less readily in warm environments than cold ones.</p><p>Tantalizingly, given the current crisis, the coronaviruses that cause colds also show a marked spike in wintertime transmission and a nosedive in summer. But a warm-weather decrease in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is unlikely to help us much, researchers say.</p><p>Unlike for flu and cold viruses, the vast majority of the population has no immunity to the novel coronavirus. This huge pool of susceptible people is kindling for the pandemic forest fire.</p><p>\"Seasonality is a main structuring element of our planet,\" says Micaela Martinez, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"We can expect that there will be some seasonal features to SARS-CoV-2. It's just that right now in this pandemic phase, we have such a high fraction of the world's population that is susceptible, that we can't expect that seasonal declines in transmission alone will be able to give us this huge drop.\"</p><p>Any decline we do see shouldn't dupe us into thinking we beat the pandemic. When Canadian researchers modelled the autumn uptick of swine flu in Alberta during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, they found that the reopening of schools in fall had a much larger effect on the surge than cold weather did.</p><p>\"This is a new virus, and we haven't seen it spread in the summer,\" said David Earn, a mathematics professor and member of the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, and a co-author of the Alberta study.</p><p>\"But based on experience with influenza, it seems very unlikely that weather changes could compensate for social distancing measures.\"</p><p>Immunity passports</p><p>Researchers at Sinai Health and the University of Toronto announced this week that a robotic laboratory platform at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI) has the potential to process 10,000 tests daily that can determine who has immune protection from COVID-19.</p><p>The tests are still being fine-tuned, but the ability to carry out immunity testing - also known as serology - on a massive scale is a necessary component for a strategy being contemplated in some European countries: \"immunity passports.\"</p><p>The idea is to identify people carrying antibodies to the novel coronavirus, evidence that their immune system already fought off COVID-19 and they have some level of protection from being reinfected. (These antibody blood tests are different from the typical tests to diagnose the illness, which search for viral genetic material in nose or throat swabs).</p><p>People with protective antibodies might safely return to work, restoring some parts of the labour force.</p><p>Not surprisingly, a whack of scientific, policy and ethical questions remain.</p><p>Because the virus is still so new, lots of questions persist about immune protection from COVID-19. Are those who already had it completely immune, or merely protected from severe illness but potentially still contagious if reinfected? How long before that immunity wanes? Does everyone produce high levels of antibodies, or just some people?</p><p>Secondly, an antibody test that is 99 per cent accurate would still mean that one in 100 people would wrongly believe they are immune, risking their own health and that of others if they did get a \"pass\" to return to work.</p><p>Equity issues are also a challenge. Who gets the test? If it gives some people a \"passport\" to work and not others, testing would either have to be rolled out across the entire population, or reserved for front-line health workers or those in high-risk settings, like nursing homes and prisons.</p><p>Last week, the World Health Organization warned that rapid-result (non-laboratory) immune tests should only be used in research settings, and not for clinical decision-making until more evidence becomes available.</p><p>The Sinai-U of T research team is still hard at work, but hopes to tackle some of the big science questions first. The lab is certified for research and would need approval for clinical work, and to expand its industrial partners to massively scale up the production of test kits.</p><p>\"No test is perfect,\" notes Jim Woodgett, Koffler Director of Research at LTRI. But people who test positive for antibodies \"can be put into environments where you're not going to infect other people, and you're not going to get infected yourself ... that does open up possibilities,\" particularly for essential services, he said, adding that Germany is already discussing this.</p><p>Digital contact tracing</p><p>The bedrock public health tool kit is the same in any outbreak: test, trace, isolate, repeat. No matter how technologically advanced the country, every nation is engaged in confirming new cases through testing, tracing contacts of those cases to hunt down potential new infections, and isolating people to break chains of transmission.</p><p>Ontario has been justifiably focused on its failure so far to test widely, a lapse that has assured many cases of COVID-19 are going uncounted and untraced. To fight this pandemic to the bitter end, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's top public health official, said Friday that testing must be scaled up across the country.</p><p>Contact tracing has drawn less scrutiny, perhaps because it is more low-tech. Public health staff work phone lines and patients' memories to track down everyone who might have come in contact with known cases, informing those contacts of their risk and telling them to self-isolate.</p><p>A recent study in the prestigious journal Science suggested that manual contact tracing was too slow to catch up to the speed at which the virus is transmitted, and that digital contact tracing - using cellphone location data - would be necessary to stop the pandemic.</p><p>Countries in Asia have already used cellphone location data for digital contact tracing and to find patients who are breaking quarantine orders. But in North America, those sensitive to privacy concerns are understandably queasy about sharing an entire population's real-time cellphone location data with the government: \"emergency\" powers are sometimes hard to unwind post-emergency.</p><p>Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the Universit&amp;#233; de Montr&amp;#233;al, has proposed an artificial intelligence-based app that uses location information and test results to calculate an infectious risk score, but shares that data between phones rather than in a central database.</p><p>\"The problem is, you don't want governments or other, for-profit organizations to build a database knowing where everyone was ... because it could be abused,\" Bengio, a recipient of the Turing Prize and a leader of ethical AI movements, told the Star in March.</p><p>\"It can be done completely in a peer-to-peer way.

The buildings had been abandoned and derelict for 60 years, when the Friends of Wells Gray Park and BC Parks co-funded a restoration project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Stillwater Road turns right off the Clearwater Valley Road at km 35.7, just south of the Park entrance. The road descends to Blackwater Creek, then climbs up the other side of the valley. The trailhead to the Bee Farm is signed at km 3.5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A hike of less than 10 minutes leads to Smith Lake which is 400 m long at an elevation of 750 m. The trail skirts the lake on the right or south side, then goes over undulating terrain with a gradual descent to the next junction. Here, follow the left fork which soon reaches a collapsed bridge over Hemp Creek.</p><p>Continue upstream along Hemp Creek for about 30 minutes to reach the Bee Farm. The three main structures are the cabin, bee shed, and outhouse.</p><p>The Bee Farm is the story of two remarkable sisters, Jessie and Frances Emery. Jessie was born on Aug. 16, 1910 and Frances on May 23, 1913. Eventually, the family had nine children and they moved from Alberta to East Blackpool near Clearwater in 1922. The girls' father, Ernest, had invested in some bees and Jessie gradually took over his beekeeping tasks as she got older.</p><p>In the summer of 1926, life in Upper Clearwater took a dramatic change when a huge forest fire swept through the valley. Large burned tracts of land created by the fire were soon covered in fireweed, willow and other deciduous shrubs. Ernest died in 1928 and, by 1930, the Great Depression was taking hold on western Canada.</p><p>Jessie still managed to earn a small income from her six beehives on the Blackpool farm. The bee inspector told her about the vast fields of fireweed growing in the Hemp Creek Valley, thanks to the fire of 1926. In Upper North Thompson Reflections, Frances described how she and Jessie, assisted by older brother Norman and younger brother Ralph, relocated their beekeeping operation:</p><p>Jessie filed for a homestead there in 1930 when we were 20 and 17, and we moved the bees to the Upper Clearwater Valley. Norman and Jessie built the cabin while Ralph and I split shakes and helped any way we could. There were beautiful cedar trees that had been killed by the fire but not really burned. What lumber we needed was split from them ...</p><p>Any other materials needed had to be packed to the Bee Farm, as the end of the road in 1930 was near Trout Creek.</p><p>The Canadian Association of Palynologists estimates that, to produce one pound of honey, bees must visit two million flowers, fly about 80,000 km and carry about 37,000 loads of nectar back to the hive. During peak flower blooming periods, bees from a single hive may visit up to 250,000 flowers in a single day. With such activity, a beekeeper's job continues year-round and, in the case of the Emery sisters, they had to hike quite a distance into the wilderness to tend their bees.</p><p>In spring, the hives' winter insulation was unwrapped, food supplies checked and dead colonies removed. If the queen was productive, the hive filled quickly with brood and honey and could run out of space, causing swarming. This was prevented by adding extra shelves (or supers), giving more space for honey production. In summer, honey was removed, processed and packed. During fall, the colony's health and strength had to be checked again because weak or diseased hives would be unlikely to survive the winter.</p><p>The sisters also had to protect their hives from invading animals because bee larvae and honey were a delicacy for bears, skunks and raccoons. In winter, the girls also had to check the hives regularly because the bees could suffocate if the entrance to the hives was blocked by a heavy snowfall. Charlie Ludtke recalled that his brother Fred had a trapline near the Bee Farm and he cleared away the snow from the hives when he went by.</p><p>After they had set up their beekeeping operation among the fields of fireweed, the Bee Girls realized they needed to expand, so they doubled their hives to 12 and began to enjoy even more plentiful honey harvests. They sold their honey for up to 18 cents per pound locally. With each of the 12 hives producing 200 to 250 pounds of honey, the girls could make as much as $540 per year.</p><p>Their business was flourishing.</p><p>The Shook family arrived in the Clearwater Valley in 1934 with nine children and homesteaded near Grouse Creek. Two of the boys were Floyd and Roy. Frances Emery recalled, \"On March 1, 1934, Jessie and I headed for the Bee Farm to clean up the bee supers. On the way, we picked up the mail for the valley settlers and, while we were delivering it, we met Floyd and Roy Shook.\"</p><p>Soon the brothers arrived at the Bee Farm where they helped the girls finish some of the buildings and built a bee house for the hives. The romance developed from there. Frances married Floyd in 1936 and Jessie married Roy the following year. Two weeks after that wedding, Roy and Floyd's sister Freda married Frances and Jessie's brother Ralph, creating a triple relationship between two families of nine children.</p><p>Jessie and Frances kept the Bee Farm operating until about 1940. They did most of the work themselves because Roy and Floyd were busy on the homesteads and not too interested in bees after all. Both had young children and trips to the Bee Farm entailed packing children along too. In addition, the forest was gradually growing again after the fire and replacing the once-abundant fireweed with other plants. The hives were brought out from the Bee Farm about 1945. Jessie kept a few hives at home until she was in her sixties.</p><p>Roy Shook owned several small sawmills and the family moved frequently between mill sites. Jessie was kept busy with their five children, her wonderful gardens, and her beehives. They retired in Barnhartvale, a suburb of Kamloops. Jessie died in 1991 and Roy in 1999. Frances and Floyd raised four children and moved to Vavenby in 1947, then to Barriere, Louis Creek and back to Vavenby in 1960. Frances returned to the Bee Farm only once, with her brother-in-law Charlie, when she was 80. Charlie wrote about this event:</p><p>Fifty-four years after leaving the Bee Farm, Frances Shook came back... Frances' greatest fear was that her old home would be dilapidated, but she was pleasantly surprised at what she saw. The lilac bush still grows strongly and blooms well, a big reward for backpacking in its first beginnings and giving it loving care 60 years ago.</p><p>Floyd died in 1981 and Frances in 2001, just before her 88th birthday.</p><p>Seventy years after the Emery sisters established their Bee Farm, an examination of the buildings revealed their deteriorating condition. Comprehensive restoration was completed in 2001, co-funded by B.C. Parks and the Friends of Wells Gray Park. The project was partly finished when the Friends organized an interpretive hike to the Bee Farm in July 2001. Joining the group were all four of Frances' children (the first time they had been there as adults) and two of Jessie's children, a remarkable family reunion.</p><p>A journalist, Nigel Pooley, visited the Bee Girls in 1938 and wrote a story about them which was published in the Family Herald &amp;amp; Weekly Star on January 18, 1939. It gives some slightly different facts about the amazing story of Jessie and Frances Shook, but is reproduced here in its entirety.</p><p>CUPID IN THE APIARY</p><p>By Nigel Pooley</p><p>Jessie Emery was not doing well with her bees. She lived at Blackpool, 70 miles north of Kamloops on the North Thompson with her mother and brothers and sisters. But Blackpool is a poor bee district - not enough wild raspberries, clover and fireweed. The government bee inspector told Jessie that 40 miles from her home up the Clearwater River and five miles by packhorse beyond the last settlement were thousands of acres of fireweed. Bees should do well there. That was in 1932.</p><p>Jessie loaded up a packhorse and tramped the 40 miles to the end of the road at Upper Clearwater to see this bee Eden for herself. Yes, it was true. Four or five miles beyond the last homestead, she came on valleys choked with fireweed shoulder high.</p><p>Being a girl of action, she did not say, \"Well this would be a fine place for bees if it were a little more accessible.\" She selected a likely piece of ground, filed on a homestead, bought six packages of bees, had six hives made, and packed in the equipment.</p><p>The bees did well, so well in fact that she got her younger sister, Frances, to come and help her look after them. In the following year, the hives averaged over 200 pounds of honey to a hive, some of them producing as much as 250 pounds. The Bee Girls, as they became known in Upper Clearwater, made more money off their bees than the homesteaders did off their quarter sections.</p><p>They sold their honey for 10 cents to 15 cents a pound locally, the average being 12.5 cents. The honey was of fine flavour and density and the demand unlimited.</p><p>The original six hives increased to twelve. The girls built a fine cabin, cleared a little land, built fences and tended their bees. Every ounce of equipment had to be packed in by horses over four miles of trail from the end of the wagon road and very often over the full 24 miles from the nearest store at Clearwater. In winter, the girls lived at home, but after every heavy snowfall Jessie tied on her snowshoes and hiked into the Bee Ranch to clear the snow away from the hives lest the bees suffocate.</p><p>No doubt the Bee Girls would still be on their lonely Bee Ranch among the burned snags and fireweed had not Cupid taken a hand. The boys in Upper Clearwater somehow became \"bee conscious\" all at once. You can find out about bees from government bulletins, but with the Bee Girls right there only four miles from the end of the road, it was much easier to just walk up there and get some firsthand knowledge. And while there, it was just too bad to let the girls do all that wood-chopping and stake-splitting and fence-building.</p><p>Learning about bees soon broke into romance. Two brothers finally won the day and Jessie and Frances Emery became Mrs. Roy Shook and Mrs. Floyd Shook respectively.</p><p>I went with Roy Shook out to the Bee Ranch. He is setting up a fine home on his homestead and his wife has a full-time job looking after their five-month-old son down in \"civilization\". Roy makes trips once a week out to the apiary to see that all is well. Since they were married, he has taken over the bee-keeping and is finding it no easy task. Last winter, he was unable to get to the hives soon enough after a heavy snowstorm and lost a strong hive through suffocation.</p><p>On one trip to the hives this spring, he discovered a swarm on a nearby bush. In cajoling it into a new hive, the greater part of the swarm escaped. This summer, he had trouble again with a hive of strong bees robbing a weaker hive. He is learning fast, however, and soon hopes to get as high production as his enterprising wife had.</p><p>There is plenty of room for more bee keepers in the valleys beyond Upper Clearwater. It took two enterprising girls to show that bee-keeping can be profitable out in the wilds. The truth is, the bees barely made an impression on the sea of fireweed that chokes the valleys of this district.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-3932834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYW-HYH1-JDH1-C547-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Barriere Star Journal (N.

Conditions are misty in the Tongariro National Park on Monday morning, which has helped limit the growth of the fire overnight. However, all aircraft are grounded because of the mist. Eight teams of Fire and Emergency firefighters from Wellington and Hawkes Bay will be boosting the ground attack, alongside seven teams from the Department of Conservation, and additional volunteer firefighters from nearby brigades. There are 15 helicopters and five fixed wing planes on standby to resume operations when the weather clears, said the Fire and Emergency New Zealand. Established in 1887, Tongariro National Park is New Zealand\u2019s first national park. It has an area of around 80,000 hectares. The park is a dual UNESCO World Heritage for both its cultural significance to Maori, as well as its outstanding natural features. The forest fire was reported to the Fire and Emergency New Zealand on Saturday afternoon. There was no report of casualty or structure damage yet. However, operations have been carried out to evacuate hikers in the national park and people in the nearby facilities. The Tongariro Crossing and associated areas, which is a world-famous tourist attraction, is closed due to the fire. A section of State Highway 47 leading to the national park is closed. The cause of the fire has not been established yet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58138825916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H5K-H3X3-SCNC-0209-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Central Chronicle</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>November 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>First National Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>FXNC</className><className>NAS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

When it comes to COVID-19, what happens in Vegas doesn't stay in Vegas. Las Vegas casinos reopened June 4, and they have become a likely hotbed for the spread of the novel coronavirus, public health experts said. </p><p>But if tourists return home and then test positive for COVID-19, the limitations of contact tracing in the midst of a pandemic make it unlikely such an outbreak would be identified. Contact tracing[3], one of the pillars of stopping the pandemic, is a labor-intensive process where a health official tracks down[4] anyone who's been in contact with an infected person and takes steps to prevent the disease's spread. But there is no national system in place for contact tracing, said Joshua Michaud, an epidemiologist and associate director of global health policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. It's decentralized and performed by local health agencies that may not communicate with one another, especially given their caseloads. So, if a casino had a 'cluster outbreak' or 'superspreading event' among visitors, it's unlikely contact tracing would catch it, Michaud said. 'The way it's set up right now, contact tracers are not looking for clusters that might identify outbreaks tied to traveling to a casino or other specific locations,' Michaud said. 'You're not actively looking for it, so you might miss that event. Contact tracing is not set up to answer those questions, so you'll still be in the dark.' A new analysis of smartphone data[5], conducted at ProPublica's request, shows how interconnected the country is with visitors to Las Vegas \u2014 which heightens concerns about the limitations of interstate contact tracing. The companies X-Mode[6] and Tectonix[7] analyzed travel to and from Las Vegas during four days, a Friday to Monday, in mid-July. In compliance with privacy laws, X-Mode collects data from smartphone users, mainly those using fitness and weather apps that track their location. The data represents about 5% of the smartphone users in the United States. Tectonix analyzed the data and visualized it on a map. During the four-day period, about 26,000 devices were identified on the Las Vegas Strip. Some of those same smartphones also showed up in every state on the mainland except Maine in those same four days. About 3,700 of the devices were spotted in Southern California in the same four days; about 2,700 in Arizona, with 740 in Phoenix; around 1,000 in Texas; more than 800 in Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago and Cleveland; and more than 100 in the New York area. The cellphone analysis highlights a reason the virus keeps spreading, said Oscar Alleyne, an epidemiologist and chief program officer with the National Association of County and City Health Officials. 'People have been highly mobile, and as a result, it makes sense why we see the continuation of the surge.' Typically public health agencies talk to one another at the state level, said Kimberly Hertin, disease surveillance supervisor in the Office of Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance for the Southern Nevada Health District, which includes Las Vegas in its territory. During the pandemic, local agencies have reached out directly to one another, she said, but the data isn't tracked in a way that can show how often that happens with visitors to the Las Vegas resorts. COVID-19 has made it impossible to get a complete picture in real time, she said. In the five weeks after Las Vegas reopened, the number of daily COVID-19 cases rose tenfold. Clark County has now had more than 50,000 cases. The number of new cases per day has declined since then, but the tally in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, remains high enough that the Harvard Global Health Institute recommends[8] stay-at-home orders. (There are no such orders in place.) Hertin said the virus presents an overwhelming contact tracing challenge. Its incubation period is up to two weeks, so by the time it's discovered in a tourist who came to Las Vegas, the person would probably be home. It's 'pretty much impossible' to identify the source of the cases, Hertin said. Contact tracing efforts are focused on the person with a confirmed case to make sure they don't spread it to others, not identifying the source of that person's infection, Hertin said. 'Once you've reached the point of community spread with this virus, it's hard to jump to that conclusion of any clusters or outbreaks,' she said. Beyond that, with the numbers as high as they are, local health departments can barely keep up with cases of people who live in their jurisdiction. 'Our systems are in place for doing this when diseases are not highly prevalent,' like an E. coli or salmonella outbreak traced to lettuce or onions, Alleyne said. But COVID-19 is affecting hundreds of thousands of people, he said. 'That magnifies and overwhelms the system.' Public health experts say there are several keys to containing COVID-19: social distancing and wearing masks around others, having abundant and timely testing to see who has the virus, contract tracing to encourage those who had contact with infected people to isolate, and isolation for those infected. Reducing unnecessary travel and outings also helps stifle the virus. In some cases, casinos say they are doing their part to identify situations in which their guests may have been infected during their stays. MGM Resorts International, which owns the Bellagio, Aria, Mandalay Bay and other properties, says in its safety plan that guests should email the company if they test positive. MGM provided ProPublica with a statement[9] about its safety efforts. But the company would not share how many times it has received emails. MGM also declined to say how many times it had notified the Southern Nevada Health District about possible transmission of COVID-19 on one of its properties. MGM's policy of having guests email the company and then referring them to the health district is 'a lot of steps in a chain where you could miss a connection,' Michaud said. 'If someone gets tested when they get back home and don't email them back, it's a piece of information they would never get.' Hertin said the Southern Nevada Health District has received reports from the casinos about cases. But the available data doesn't allow for an easy way to show which resorts or how many cases, she said. That may be possible to say in retrospect after the virus has subsided, she said. The number of visitors to Las Vegas has steadily increased since it reopened. Many drive from neighboring states, and more than a million passengers came through the airport in June, which is about a quarter as many as the same month in 2019. Air travel nationwide is down more, 80% in June compared with the previous year. The cellphone data analysis shows how travel to Las Vegas could be fueling the pandemic, Alleyne said. 'In this rush to reopen and reposition the economic activities, all we've been doing is spreading and amplifying the reach of this disease.''Gambling With Lives'ProPublica spoke to six public health experts who called casinos a high-risk environment for COVID-19. They are indoors, potentially crowded and filled with people prone to taking risks. It's almost certain, the experts said, that casinos are a feeding ground for COVID-19. 'There is a serious opportunity for spreading the virus, especially for people who are mildly sick or don't know they're sick,' said Crystal Watson, senior scholar at The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Up to 40% of those infected with COVID-19 show no symptoms. 'We've seen big outbreaks kicked off by these types of situations.' Workers in Las Vegas worry about the spread of the virus, too. Ralph McIver calls the kitchen at Binion's Caf, where he works, a 'melting pot' of employees. The caf is located in Binion's Gambling Hall on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. During his shifts, McIver works 'almost elbow-to-elbow' with two colleagues on the cook's line, grilling up ham and eggs, Hangover Burgers and Cowboy Cheesesteak sandwiches. 'It's difficult to stay socially distanced,' he said. McIver is diabetic, which puts him at higher risk of a severe case of COVID-19. He also lives near his elderly mother, who is also at high risk. Binion's didn't require employees to be tested for COVID-19 before returning to work, which made McIver uneasy. He would feel better if he and his colleagues had initial and follow-up tests, he said. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more worried he feels. 'My concern has only gotten worse.' Binion's officials did not return requests for comment. Nevada regulators set minimum standards for COVID-19 protections but allowed the casinos to choose many of their own safety measures \u2014 to the dismay of many workers. That's not a surprise, because gaming companies have significant sway over policymakers in Nevada. Las Vegas could almost be called a company town, and its economy depends on tourism \u2014 even in the pandemic. In a rambling and contentious interview[10] with CNN's Anderson Cooper during the shutdown, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman advocated for reopening despite the virus and appeared to offer the city as a sort of 'control group' in an experiment. 'How do you know until we have a control group?' she asked. 'We offered to be a control group.' When it comes to regulation in Nevada, Michael Green, a historian at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, put it this way: 'The casino industry is the tail that wags the dog. It may also just be the dog.' The casinos do operate in a much different way since the start of COVID-19. Capacity is limited. Workers are checked for symptoms every day. Slot machines and seats at gaming tables are spread apart. Plexiglas barriers separate dealers and players, and hand-washing and sanitizing stations are located throughout the properties. But in other ways, the regulators allowed the casinos to take the same varied response to the coronavirus as has taken place from state to state. At first, guests were not required to wear masks, even when indoors, which is one of the main protections recommended by public health experts. After COVID-19 cases started rising, Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, ordered face coverings for everyone in public spaces, particularly indoors. He also ordered the closure of bars in certain counties, including Clark. The companies' reopening plans varied in significant ways. Wynn Resorts required every employee to be tested, for instance, but MGM did not. And the standards that have been set have been unevenly enforced, workers told ProPublica. They said that even now visitors can go without masks by saying they're smoking or drinking. The biggest push for improved safety has come from the workforce. Officials from Culinary Union, the largest union representing the hospitality employees in Las Vegas, said in the initial weeks after reopening, they documented scores of cases where guests did not wear masks or failed to stay distanced, or casinos ran out of hand sanitizer or protective equipment for workers. The union filed a lawsuit in late June against several properties, accusing them of failing to protect workers. It's now been resolved, with the union and companies working together to pass legislation that was signed by the governor that establishes protections for workers, including standards for cleaning, social distancing and hand-washing; notification within 24 hours if they may have been exposed to the virus; and inspections to ensure compliance. Workers have also questioned the casinos' efforts at contact tracing. Jessica Bremer's experience became part of Culinary Union's now-resolved lawsuit. In mid-June, Bremer said she heard from colleagues \u2014 not her employer \u2014 that one of her co-workers at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen &amp;#38; Bar tested positive for COVID-19. Bremer, a specialty cook, said her employer, The LINQ, which is owned by Harrah's, part of casino giant Caesars Entertainment, did not handle the situation in a way that she believed protected her and other workers. Bremer showed up for her shift after hearing her colleague had tested positive. But she told her supervisors she didn't feel comfortable working. Bremer, 35, suffers from multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that makes her more susceptible to a severe case of COVID-19. According to the lawsuit, one supervisor told her she would 'have to deal with it' and another told her she should continue working. The company's security team was determining which employees could be at risk because of contact with the infected worker, she was told. That didn't sit well with Bremer. 'Security officers don't have a medical degree,' Bremer said. 'If someone is going to deem what's safe and what's not safe, it should be a medical professional or someone with COVID training.' Even after finding out Bremer had been on a recent shift with the infected employee, the company told her and other colleagues to work that day, she said. The employees pushed back, and so many refused to come to work the next day they closed the restaurant for 10 days, she said. Employees were paid during the closure, she said. Employees at other casinos made similar allegations in the lawsuit. ProPublica asked officials from Caesars about Bremer's account of the restaurant closing. They declined to talk about what she said, but they provided a statement[11] saying their properties, 'have deployed an extensive contact tracing program that leverages our sophisticated surveillance, security, and Human Resources tools.' The properties have also put 'extensive' safety precautions in place, the statement said, and employees who are at high risk or do not want to come back to work are allowed to defer their return. A spokesperson from the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services said 337 non-Nevada residents tested positive for COVID-19 in the state in June and most of July. The state agency could identify 10 out-of-state residents who were believed to be infectious while visiting Nevada and who tested positive for COVID-19 when they returned home. Public health experts said those numbers fall far short of quantifying the problem. The state numbers are certainly a 'significant undercount,' said Alleyne, the epidemiologist with the association of county and city health officials. Reopening Las Vegas is 'gambling with lives,' said Michelle Follette Turk, an occupational health historian at UNLV. The government gambled by letting the casino owners create their own health and safety plans and failing to require masks until after the COVID-19 numbers were rising, she said. 'The employers are gambling with employee life because they want to make a profit,' Turk added. 'But employees are gambling with their lives \u2014 they need a paycheck.'A Forest FirePinar Keskinocak, a Georgia Institute of Technology professor who specializes in infectious disease modeling, compared the COVID-19 cases coming out of Las Vegas to a forest fire. Imagine if a group of trees was on fire and then some of the flames jumped to another area, where they ignited other trees, she said. That's the kind of spread that can occur nationwide because of people gathering in Las Vegas, she said. The risk is much more significant than the risk posed by schools reopening, Keskinocak said. At schools, the same group of students and teachers interact with one another every day, and they're likely to live in the same geographic area. So any infection transmission will be contained within the group and perhaps their families. But in a casino, people from all over the country gather, and they get together in new groups every day. Then they return to places all over the country. In this way, she said, Las Vegas 'could significantly fuel the disease spread.' Discrepancies in how policymakers protect the public magnify the problem, Keskinocak said. One county or state might have strict interventions, like sheltering in place, or mask wearing, but a neighboring area might not, she said. 'It's important to have a concerted effort nationwide,' Keskinocak said. 'If you are doing these interventions in a haphazard way and not coordinating, then we make progress and we regress again.' Michaud, the Kaiser Family Foundation epidemiologist, said there are countries that were able to suppress the virus early on, and now they are returning to almost normal. But that's not what happened in the United States. So now policymakers are trying to strike a balance between preventing the spread of the virus and resuming normal activity. And in many locations, like Las Vegas, decision-makers have sided with opening the economy. 'I don't expect a major lockdown occurring anytime in the near future,' he said. 'That means there's likely to be continued transmission. It's horrifying, but it's true.' Loyal visitors to Vegas say they will keep coming. Michele Heil and her husband take three trips a year to Las Vegas, where they are regulars at El Cortez Hotel and Casino on Fremont Street. The couple lives in central Illinois, where Heil said she is a social worker who does health care administration. Their June trip was planned before the pandemic hit, and they had no concerns about going. Things went smoothly. She said she was more worried about COVID-19 on the plane than in the casinos. Their temperature was taken when they entered each property, people stayed socially distanced and the cleaning crews were active. 'Before we left we already had our next trip planned,' Heil said. 'We're going back in September.'
