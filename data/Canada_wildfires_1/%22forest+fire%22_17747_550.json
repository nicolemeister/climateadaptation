(NAM or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labradors Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. This support will enable NAM to advance exploration at its Newfoundland Gold-Antimony Division project in the St. Albans region of south-central Newfoundland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In July, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador's Mineral Incentive Program officially approved NAMs application as filed, designating it as a Critical Minerals as a Primary Exploration Target project. This prioritization ensures eligibility for CMA and PCMA funding.</p><p>Application Highlights //st * The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975. * Total exploration budget of approximately $225,000, with potential rebate support of up to 40% of eligible costs, capped at $150,000 for island-based projects; * The Antimony Ridge property hosts the Antimony Ridge Showing, the Golden Grit Showing, and the Southwest Brook Ag Showing; * Eligible exploration activities include geological mapping, prospecting, soil, till, and lake sediment sampling, and targeted channel sampling and backpack drilling; * The prerequisite exploration permits have been approved and received; * Located close to hydroelectric power and communities, with skilled workforce and reliable road/trail access; and * Area historically explored for gold and base metals (copper, lead, zinc).</p><p>Harry Barr, NAM Chairman and CEO comments, NAM is very grateful for the support of the Provincial JEA by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and for CMA financial support by the Government of Canada, for NAM's antimony and gold exploration program in the Province. The generous support further strengthens NAM's ability to hire local personnel and quickly advance its goal of discovering new critical metal deposits in underexplored areas of Newfoundland in 2025 and beyond. We are preparing for our upcoming Phase 2 exploration program, which will follow-up on the results of the very successful Phase 1 exploration program completed in May-June 2025.</p><p>Phase 2 Field Program Plan</p><p>In follow-up to the Phase 1 results1, a focused field program is ongoing and will include: //st * Additional detailed geological mapping and mineral prospecting, rock sampling, and structural analysis of mineralized trends; * Channel sampling and backpack drilling of Antimony Ridge and any promising discoveries; and * Geochemical surveys (soil, till, and lake sediment sampling), with approximately 250 to 1000 samples across prospective zones and areas with limited bedrock exposure.</p><p>The budget for these exploration activities is $225,000.</p><p>On June 19, 2025, NAM. entered into an Option Agreement with Mr. Ross Collier to acquire a 100% interest in the mineral rights to the Antimony Ridge Property (Mineral Licence #035215M)2. This newly acquired ground directly adjoins NAM Licence #038953M (NAMs 100% owned Citadel Property Figure 1) and covers highly prospective terrain with documented antimony, base metal, and gold occurrences. NAM plans to fully integrate the Antimony Ridge Property into its 2025 Field Exploration Program, with targeted activities including backpack drilling and in-fill soil sampling over and around the main Antimony Ridge occurrence. The inclusion of Antimony Ridge significantly enhances the geological potential of NAM's property portfolio and strengthens its alignment with Newfoundland and Labrador's critical mineral exploration priorities.</p><p>Figure 1. Location of NAM's Antimony Ridge and Citadel Property in the St Alban's area of south-central Newfoundland. The total area of the two properties is 3775 hectares.</p><p>About the JEA Program</p><p>The JEA Program is designed to expand the mineral inventory of Newfoundland and Labrador by supporting discovery of new mineral deposits. The program also aims to advance known deposits toward NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources, in order to strengthen the Provinces position as a mineral exploration space of choice. The JEA is funded through a combination of $1.3M in Provincial Grant Funds, $1.3M from Critical Mineral Assistance (\"CMA\"), and $1.3M in Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (\"PCMA\"). Funding is provided to junior companies as rebates for eligible exploration activities. Junior companies conducting critical mineral exploration may qualify for larger rebates through the CMA and PCMA streams. Subject to budget approval for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, JEA rebates 40% of eligible exploration costs up to a maximum (including any CMA and PCMA) of $150,000 per project in Newfoundland.</p><p>At this point, the amount of the potential JEA program rebate is $71,974.69. The rebate is paid when all the final exploration reports have been received, reviewed and accepted by the Newfoundland Department of Industry, Energy and Technology.</p><p>Press Release References</p><p>1.

Nevertheless, the Qualified Person considers that drilling and analytical results were completed to industry standard practices. The reader is cautioned that mineral occurrences, prospects and deposits on neighbouring properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Companys properties. This information may provide an indication of the exploration potential of the Properties, but might not be representative of exploration results.</p><p>About NAMs PGE Division</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of green metal projects in North America. The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>About NAMs Lithium Division</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and mid-tier mining companies through to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for its River Valley Palladium Project and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are welcome to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

Joslynn Theodorf and her 11-year-old daughter Hayleigh are living in an SUV in Prince Albert, after fleeing La Ronge because of an approaching wildfire. And that would be a pretty small living space even if it were just them -- but their four dogs are living in there with them as well. Here are Josylnn and Hayleigh talking to CBC Saskatchewan reporter Alexandre Silberman.</p><p><br/><br/>JOSLYNN THEODORF: Well, it makes you happy for the simple things. We have shampoo today. [laughing] You know, like, it's just the little things. You had a meal. Well, we hadn't slept until last night, finally, since we came down. It was quite a ride. We had people sitting on top of people, four dogs in this car. So, we've been sleeping in our car outside the vac centre, but we put our seats down. As you can see, it's kind of cozy. [chuckling] But it's a place to be and we're safe.<br/><br/>ALEXANDRE SILBERMAN: What's it been like for you?<br/><br/>HAYLELGH THEODORF: It's been very crazy with four dogs inside the car.<br/><br/>AS: I bet. What was the drive like? What did things look like outside the window?<br/><br/>HT: Fire.<br/><br/>JT: She was scared the whole way. But I've been through the first forest fire, so I knew what to expect. But you were a little creeped, eh? You'd see the fire things burning on the side of the road. They had fun taking pictures, and then you'd see the northern lights. It was kind of interesting.<br/><br/>AS: How does it feel to see all of those photos and those videos that are coming out now of the damage?<br/><br/>JT: We cry, hey? That's our home. I'm originally from Ontario, but I've lived out here for more than half of my life, so this is home. We're told at one point our house was gone, but then I found out from our dog sitter that she checked our house and it's still standing, but there's lots that are not. We lost a lot of our downtown, apparently. Rona's gone, Robertson's trading. There's lots gone, hey?

He figured if it came to it, he could put 10 people in the boat and his small 40-horsepower motor would get them across the lake in about 10 minutes. Then he'd come back and do it again and again until everyone was safe.</p><p> \"I had fuel. I had my oars. I even had my fishing rods ready and stuff. It was all set up and ready to go,\" he said.</p><p> Fortunately, a water bomber was on the scene within hours, arriving when the fire was spreading aggressively, going from two to 200 hectares in only an hour and a half, Meekis said. </p><p> Dropping more than 6,000 litres of water in a single load, the \"super scooper\" was able to cool down the area around the airport enough so that ground crews could beat back the flames and the runway was reopened.</p><p> With more than 40 Ontario fire rangers on the ground deploying hoses and sprinklers, the town's essential infrastructure has been saved. At one point, the fire was raging less than 100 metres from the nursing station; the band office came within 60 metres of going up in smoke.</p><p> The people of Deer Lake are still worried about the fire, which had burned more than 17,000 hectares when Meekis got on that plane in early June and has since exploded to over 183,000 hectares. If it flares back up around town, it could destroy their homes. But after witnessing Ontario's forest firefighters in action, Meekis was hopeful they have escaped the worst.</p><p> \"They're good people who have been through this before and are very knowledgeable and know how to fight the fire. I'm grateful there's people like that.\"</p><p> But with this new breed of fire, \"we're going to need a lot more of them,\" he said.</p><p>'It's just not a livable job anymore'</p><p>It's hard to predict how bad a fire season will be because the weather can turn on a dime. But this year in Ontario is shaping up to be a doozy.</p><p>The wildfire that forced the evacuation of Deer Lake - dubbed Red Lake 12 - is alone more than twice as large as all the forest fires that burned last year provincewide.</p><p>And while the town is safe for now and everyone has been safely evacuated, some people are questioning how the fire got so out of hand so quickly - and whether that would have happened if there were more fire rangers available.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were 732 fire rangers. Now there are 630.</p><p>At a time when the threat of forest fires is greater than it has ever been, our front line of defence is understaffed by more than 100 firefighters.</p><p>With fewer fire rangers, reaction time to new fires is slower, and more of them are escaping containment. </p><p>\"Would these fires have become as big as they are if we just had the same resources as we've had in the past?\" said Noah Freedman, a crew leader and vice-president of the fire rangers union, OPSEU Local 703.</p><p>The problem, according to government reports, the union as well as more than a dozen interviews with current and former firefighters, is staff retention. What used to be a career for people across Ontario's north has turned into a summer job for most.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch (AFFES) \"is losing their experienced staff at an alarming rate,\" states an internal Ministry of Natural Resources report obtained by the Star.</p><p>The report, published nearly a decade ago, identified a turnover rate of 45 per cent - a rate that has not improved.</p><p>\"Because of this turnover, the organization has been forced to promote employees despite them possessing only minimal practical experience and limited fire line expertise,\" the report states.</p><p>It's not just fire rangers that are short-staffed. At least three of the province's nine water bombers have been grounded this season due to a lack of pilots, according to OPSEU. </p><p>\"Just weeks ago, crews in northwestern Ontario worked tirelessly battling wildfires to save people's homes and property,\" the union said in a statement. \"All the while, an aircraft sat unused, calling into question whether that grounded aircraft and a skilled crew could have made a difference.\"</p><p>In a dangerous job like forest firefighting, a lack of experience can be deadly.</p><p>\"Say you have a guy that has 10 years of experience leading a crew. They can see things and read things that somebody who has become a crew leader after three years just won't notice or won't even think of,\" said Dean Rosen, a former Ontario fire ranger who worked for five seasons out of Pickle Lake, more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. \"Lots of those little mistakes can have big consequences when you just don't have the right amount of experience.\"</p><p>Rosen, who wrote his master's thesis in 2021 on turnover in the Ontario FireRanger program, says there are many issues affecting retention, ranging from the remote, isolated work conditions to the physical difficulty and danger of the work itself. The fact that forest firefighters aren't employed year-round means that everyone is effectively laid off every year and has months to think about whether they want to go back.</p><p>But ultimately, it comes down to pay.</p><p>While entry-level pay recently went up to $25.38 an hour, it hasn't kept up with inflation. Today, crew members are only making one-and-a-half times minimum wage. Fifteen years ago, their wages were more than double minimum wage.</p><p>\"It's just not a livable job anymore, really. Unless fire seasons are crazy and you're working your ass off,\" said Rosen. \"Because the money's in the overtime.\"</p><p>In 2021, the last big wildfire season in Ontario, Rosen said fire rangers were able to work 500 hours overtime, adding 50 per cent to their take-home earnings.</p><p>In the quiet seasons since, there hasn't been much action. Not only is this discouraging people from returning, but those who do are not building up much on-the-ground experience.</p><p>\"You get somebody who comes into the program and they're all excited and amped up and ready to go, and then they're just kind of sitting all summer. And that really deters them from coming back the next year,\" he said. \"If you're not giving them incentive to stay in the program and to develop their skills and experience and move up the ranks, why would they?\"</p><p>The budget is not enough </p><p>- even in slow years</p><p>The bottleneck is a lack of crew leaders. No matter how many rookies are brought in, the province cannot hire additional crew members if there are no crew leaders to supervise them.</p><p>According to a 2024 ministerial briefing document obtained by the Star, the optimal number of fire rangers is 756, organized into 189 four-person crews. But in order to achieve this level of coverage, the province needs 189 crew leaders - and it has been coming up far short.</p><p>This year, there are only 144 crew leaders and, as a result, the FireRangers are limited to fielding that number of crews. Even though one-third of these crews were assigned an extra member - adopting a five-person model that had been discontinued years ago after it was found to be inefficient - the province is still 45 crews and more than 100 fire rangers short.</p><p>With fewer people on the front line, the FireRangers' response time is suffering. Over the past 10 years, the province's preferred performance metric, called \"wildfire containment effectiveness\" or \"initial attack success rate,\" has dropped markedly.</p><p>The percentage of significant fires that were \"being held\" by noon the day after they were reported was nearly 98 per cent in 2014. In 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, that had dropped to 92 per cent - well short of the 96 per cent target.</p><p>Getting to a fire quickly is important because only two per cent of fires account for 98 per cent of the forest area burned each year, according to a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation prepared for the auditor general and obtained by the Star. In other words, 98 per cent of fires are put out when they're small and it's the handful of fires that escape early containment that cause virtually all the damage.</p><p>In Deer Lake, so many resources were focused on saving the town that the fire was never contained and it grew rapidly in the opposite direction. A week later, it had become the second biggest fire on record in Ontario, and had burned 60 kilometres north until it reached the doorstep of the next town, Sandy Lake, which also had to be evacuated.</p><p>With more fires and fewer fire rangers to fight them, the pressure on the small number of experienced leaders increases.</p><p>Ten years ago, according to the ministry report on recruitment and retention, more than half the crew leaders had one year of experience or less in the position, and the vast majority of the initial attacks on fires were led by the more experienced crew leaders. At the fire base in Sioux Lookout, for example, only one of the 17 crew leaders had led more than 10 initial attacks, and he had 48 to his name.</p><p>While the AFFES has produced two followup reports over the last decade, it declined to provide them to the Star. The Ministry of Natural Resources did not respond to questions for this story, instead sending a statement that read: \"Ontario remains an internationally recognized leader in wildfire fire management.\"</p><p>Over the last two years, the province has added 100 year-round \"support\" positions, and paid out a one-time \"retention incentive payment\" of up to $5,000 to fire rangers last year, the statement read. There's also been a pay bump, a bonus introduced for days spent camping while fighting fires and as much as $500 in reimbursement for eligible expenses related to training, including the cost of safety boots.</p><p>At the FireRangers base in Haliburton, supervisor Bob Hurley said the real difference maker has been the introduction of nine-month \"tech\" contracts for crew leaders, which allows some of them to start earlier in the spring and stay later in the fall.</p><p>\"I think we've turned the corner. We're starting to see the positive recruitment come back in, and we're starting to see people come back. They want to be here,\" he said. </p><p>According to the union that represents fire rangers, however, these retention measures haven't been enough to address the problem.</p><p>\"We are having an enormously difficult time keeping people because the job is extremely demanding and we aren't being recognized in terms of compensation for how hard we work and the risk that we put on ourselves in the same way that structural firefighters are,\" said Freedman, who has nine years of front-line experience.</p><p>It's not just a question of the number of rangers, he said, but a lack of crews means they can fight fewer fires at once, take longer to respond to new fires, and run the risk of letting them grow out of control.</p><p>\"They only have seven crews in Red Lake, when they're supposed to have 15. In Geraldton, they've got six crews, and they're supposed to have 18,\" he said. \"It's bad.\"</p><p>While Ontario's emergency wildfire suppression budget has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, the cost of actually fighting the fires is almost always more - a lot more. The AFFES has blown past its budget every year but one over the past decade. It happens in big fire years as expected, but also in quiet years, when little forest burns.</p><p>Asked about these budget overruns, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesperson Mike Fenn explained that the budget \"ensures the resources are in place to respond immediately at the onset of fire season.\"</p><p>\"Once the total costs for the fire season can be accurately predicted, the ministry will request the balance of the total funding requirements from the contingency fund,\" he said.</p><p>This is not a good way to plan, Freedman said, because it leaves fire rangers scrambling to find helicopters and planes in the middle of a busy fire season instead of leasing them in advance. The approach is indicative of a service stretched to its limits, one that scrambles to fulfil its duties with fewer staff and aircraft than needed, he added.</p><p>\"We are not anywhere near what they call the 'ideal capacity,' and that's saying nothing about the capacity we'll need in the future,\" said Freedman.</p><p>The number of fires and forest area burned across Canada, which has doubled over the past 60 years, is projected to double again by the end of this century. It stands to reason that the cost of forest fire fighting will also rise, but by how much remains the focus of debate.</p><p>Studies have pegged the rise as low as 45 per cent and as high as 145 per cent.</p><p>Research carried out by the Canadian Forest Service found that in order to adequately contain the bigger fires and prevent them from entering towns and cities, the cost could be far greater. The study found a 15 per cent increase in the number and size of forest fires would require a doubling of resources needed to contain them at the same rate as today.</p><p>So if fire activity doubles as expected, Ontario would need six times more firefighting resources - fire rangers, water bombers, helicopters and support staff - or risk losing control of many more massive runaway fires.</p><p>How to prepare for the next</p><p> fire disaster</p><p>If you want to see a vision of a future racked by climate change, you need only look across the country to British Columbia.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, Canada's westernmost province has suffered repeated natural disasters: wildfires that have levelled towns, torrential rains that have washed out highways, floods that have turned entire communities into islands and heat waves that have killed hundreds. The provincial government has spent a lot of time reviewing the damage and preparing for the next disaster, and the ways it has beefed up its wildfire service are instructive for Ontario.</p><p>Despite having a smaller land mass to cover and fewer people to protect, B.C. now employs twice as many wildfire fighters as Ontario. It also has three times as many water bombers and more helicopters.</p><p>In 2022, B.C. announced it would convert the service from seasonal to year-round, pledging more than $200 million in new funding. In the three years since, the number of year-round jobs has risen by 56 per cent, according to figures provided to the Star, and the wildfire service now employs more than 600 year-round staff - nearly the same number of people as the entire fire ranger force in Ontario.</p><p>\"Historically, wildfires were really seen as just  a summer situation. The core wildfire season would be July and August and that was what we were prepared for,\" said BC Wildfire Service information officer Sarah Budd. \"This is a year-round problem. The climate that we're working in is changing, and we need to be ready for a much longer response season.\"</p><p>Not only are the forest firefighters in B.C. on the ground earlier in the spring and staying later in the fall, but many of them are now involved in risk reduction activities in the winter, in hopes of improving the next season's response.</p><p>This means doing more prescribed burns that consume fuel on the forest floor that would otherwise feed summer fires. It also means improving access roads to get fire crews into high-risk areas, proactively creating firebreaks with heavy equipment in the winter when the machines won't bog down, and working with nearby communities to develop partnerships with local fire departments and emergency evacuation plans.</p><p>While Ontario's response mirrors some of these initiatives, it falls short of the massive effort underway in B.C. If the predictions of bigger fire seasons are to be believed, and the erosion of the fire rangers' ranks is to be turned around, a fully year-round service is the formula B.C. considers best.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty intense focus on the human resources side of it, making this into a place where people can build a career, so that you can come up through the crews and then continue to contribute that expertise. That way, we're not losing that knowledge when people peel off year after year,\" said Budd. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025062275888238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3J-VS63-RTM6-90GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

We are learning more tonight about the victims of a punishing wildfire in Manitoba who could not outrun the fast-moving flames. CTV's Alex Karpa leads us off with the shock and grief, and the real risk that remains.</p><p>ALEX KARPA (Reporter): A tragedy in the community of Lac du Bonnet, where two people have died in the clutches of a wildfire. Now CTV News is learning the victims are Richard and Sue Noel.</p><p>CINDY EMBER: Very friendly, would talk to anyone. Very creative.</p><p>KARPA: Cindy Ember works right next door where Sue reportedly worked.</p><p>EMBERTON: She was a big part of the community. Everybody knew Sue.</p><p>KARPA: Manitoba RCMP told CTV News Thursday they would not be identifying the victims until an autopsy is complete. Ember says losing both Richard and Sue if having big impact on the community.</p><p>EMBERTON: She was a, she was a very, very big part of the community, just with working at the rink. She did the rink cafe.</p><p>KARPA: The province says over a thousand people have been forced to evacuate due to the wildfires, including many here in the Lac du Bonnet region. I spoke to one resident who said it's been a hard time for him and his family.</p><p>DAN GUILLOU (Evacuee): This is home.</p><p>KARPA: Dan Guillou was forced to evacuate his home on Tuesday, and has been living out of his trailer ever since.</p><p>GUILLOU: This is where I live, and all our stuff was, is there, all our valuables, passports, pictures, kids graduation stuff.</p><p>KARPA: Video from Guillou shows the devastation left in the wake of the fire. The Reeve of Lac du Bonnet says at least 28 cottages and houses have been destroyed by the flames. Guillou says it's hard to witness.</p><p>GUILLOU: Crazy winds, fast winds, there's white caps on the water where there normally isn't. And obviously wind is the, is the worst, worst enemy. We want, we want rain.</p><p>KARPA: There are 21 active fires in the province, with at least five out of control. In a press conference earlier today, Premier Wab Kinew says he is urging Manitobans to change their plans for the upcoming long weekend.</p><p>WAB KINEW (Manitoba Premier): Any fire that goes out of control, even in an area that's not dealing with wildfire, could potentially pull resources away from the front lines where we urgently need help.</p><p>KARPA: The Manitoba government has requested an additional 80 firefighters through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre to help fight the flames burning right across the province.

The private placement will be comprised of 670,000 Flow-Through Shares at a price of $0.30 per Flow-Through Share representing proceeds of $201,000 and 250,000 Units at a price of $0.20 per Unit, representing proceeds of $50,000 for an aggregate total raised of $251,000. The Units shall consist of, and separate immediately upon closing into, one(1) common share of the Issuer (a \"Common Share\") and one (1) Warrant, each entitling the holder to purchase one (1) Common Share at a purchase price of $0.20 cents per Warrant for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date of closing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. All securities to be issued under the Offering will be subject to a four-month statutory hold period in Canada.</p><p>The funds will be utilized for general working capital purposes and ongoing work on the Fay Lake and Melgurd Lake properties.</p><p>Properties</p><p>The Fay Lake Property consists of 17 contiguous claims comprising of 2719 ha. lies 25km Northeast of Flin Flon, Manitoba. It is contiguous to the south with Hudbay Minerals Vamp Lake Cu-Zn-Au VMS property and also contiguous to the northeast, with the former Puffy Lake Gold mine. Fay Lake contains approximately 5 km of mapped VMS horizons similar to Vamp Lake. Separately, west of the rail line, a 9 km shear structure, presently known to contain similar mineralization as the Puffy Lake Gold deposit with samples assaying up to 14.33 g/t Au.</p><p>The Melgurd property consisting of 11 mineral claims totalling 7411 ha., lies Northwest of Flin Fon Manitoba just north of the Shotts Lake copper-zinc VMS deposit in Saskatchewan. Boreal's airborne magnetic and EM survey shows both EM conductors and gradient magnetic trends of the Shott Lake horizon continuing north onto the Melgurd property in the area of a felsic volcanic package. Prospecting and mapping in the summer and fall of 2023 and 2024 have outlined an area of significant garnet and anthophyllite alteration, locally this alteration is associated with gossans.</p><p>The North Star Group property, consisting of 2922 Ha in 21 contiguous claims and two mining leases is located 50 kilometres west of Snow Lake Manitoba. The Property consist of three contiguous properties which are: the North Star Gold Property; the Gold Rock Mining Lease and the Sewell Lake Critical Metals Property which is contiguous and within the same stratigraphy as HudBay Minerals Rail Zone Copper Deposit to the south and the former Dickstone Copper Zinc Mine to the North.</p><p>Going forward based on recent work on the Fay Lake (in Manitoba) and the Melgurd Lake (in Saskatchewan) properties and the recently acquired North Star Property (in Manitoba) (see April 17, 2025 News Release)</p><p>Planned Exploration and Drill Targets</p><p>In 2025 a rigorous exploration program is planned on the Fay Lake property, the North Star property and the Melgurd Lake property. Target development follows up airborne targets, which have been verified by detailed analysis, ground geophysics as well as geological mapping, sampling and prospecting in 2023 and 2024. These targets will be tested by drilling subject to the required funds being raised this year. Further ground geophysics is planned for the western portion of the Fay Lake Grid, not previously covered, prior to drilling.</p><p>Use of Proceeds</p><p>Fay Lake</p><p>Boreal Gold intends to use the proceeds from this financing to perform ground geophysical surveys over the western portion of the Fay Lake grid (not previously covered) as well as the north eastern portion of the Fay Lake grid that will be cut and surveyed to follow the strike extension of the Sunrise conductor to the eastern shore of Fay Lake. Drill testing of designed targets will follow up confirmation of Airborne conductors by ground geophysics on the Fay Lake property subject to a successful financing and direct consultation with Kiciwapa Cree Nation. Also planned is detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting on the Fay Lake Property on a small portion of the Redwin volcanogenic massive sulphide horizon that remains unmapped but contains conductors.</p><p>Separate to the VMS exploration at Fay Lake above, gold exploration through mapping and prospecting of the western portion of the Puffy Lake Mine style gold mineralization trend, east of the Railroad. Approximately 10-line kilometers is planned on this trend where samples assayed up to 14.33 g/t Au, to evaluate its on strike continuity. The gold potential at Koscielny Lake located at the eastern end of the property south of the Puffy Lake Gold Mine will also be assessed. Here mineralization contained values of up to 11.81 g/t Au (0.38 oz/ton Au) over one meter (J. Pearson, Sept. 4, 2024, National Instrument 43-101 Fay Lake technical report).</p><p>North Star</p><p>Planned Program</p><p>Line cutting and refurbishing old Grids</p><p>Refurbish and recut the Grid from South of the North Star deposit on Line 46 N to Line 59 N between Baselines 46 E and Tie Line 59 E for both mapping and drilling purposes. This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes that the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Melgurd Lake</p><p>On the Melgurd Lake property, following up detailed analysis of Airborne Geophysical conductors on strike with the Shotts Lake deposit and the encouragement found in the felsic volcanic package with VMS style alteration in the 2023-2024 field work, further work is planned to ground truth these conductors. Detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting will be carried out over these conductors on the Keep Lake grid with follow up reports. Funds will also be used for corporate purposes.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

The private placement will be comprised of 670,000 Flow-Through Shares at a price of $0.30 per Flow-Through Share representing proceeds of $201,000 and 250,000 Units at a price of $0.20 per Unit, representing proceeds of $50,000 for an aggregate total raised of $251,000. The Units shall consist of, and separate immediately upon closing into, one(1) common share of the Issuer (a \"Common Share\") and one (1) Warrant, each entitling the holder to purchase one (1) Common Share at a purchase price of $0.20 cents per Warrant for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date of closing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. All securities to be issued under the Offering will be subject to a four-month statutory hold period in Canada.</p><p>The funds will be utilized for general working capital purposes and ongoing work on the Fay Lake and Melgurd Lake properties.</p><p>Properties</p><p>The Fay Lake Property consists of 17 contiguous claims comprising of 2719 ha. lies 25km Northeast of Flin Flon, Manitoba. It is contiguous to the south with Hudbay Minerals Vamp Lake Cu-Zn-Au VMS property and also contiguous to the northeast, with the former Puffy Lake Gold mine. Fay Lake contains approximately 5 km of mapped VMS horizons similar to Vamp Lake. Separately, west of the rail line, a 9 km shear structure, presently known to contain similar mineralization as the Puffy Lake Gold deposit with samples assaying up to 14.33 g/t Au.</p><p>The Melgurd property consisting of 11 mineral claims totalling 7411 ha., lies Northwest of Flin Fon Manitoba just north of the Shotts Lake copper-zinc VMS deposit in Saskatchewan. Boreal's airborne magnetic and EM survey shows both EM conductors and gradient magnetic trends of the Shott Lake horizon continuing north onto the Melgurd property in the area of a felsic volcanic package. Prospecting and mapping in the summer and fall of 2023 and 2024 have outlined an area of significant garnet and anthophyllite alteration, locally this alteration is associated with gossans.</p><p>The North Star Group property, consisting of 2922 Ha in 21 contiguous claims and two mining leases is located 50 kilometres west of Snow Lake Manitoba. The Property consist of three contiguous properties which are: the North Star Gold Property; the Gold Rock Mining Lease and the Sewell Lake Critical Metals Property which is contiguous and within the same stratigraphy as HudBay Minerals Rail Zone Copper Deposit to the south and the former Dickstone Copper Zinc Mine to the North.</p><p>Going forward based on recent work on the Fay Lake (in Manitoba) and the Melgurd Lake (in Saskatchewan) properties and the recently acquired North Star Property (in Manitoba) (see April 17, 2025 News Release)</p><p>Planned Exploration and Drill Targets</p><p>In 2025 a rigorous exploration program is planned on the Fay Lake property, the North Star property and the Melgurd Lake property. Target development follows up airborne targets, which have been verified by detailed analysis, ground geophysics as well as geological mapping, sampling and prospecting in 2023 and 2024. These targets will be tested by drilling subject to the required funds being raised this year. Further ground geophysics is planned for the western portion of the Fay Lake Grid, not previously covered, prior to drilling.</p><p>Use of Proceeds</p><p>Fay Lake</p><p>Boreal Gold intends to use the proceeds from this financing to perform ground geophysical surveys over the western portion of the Fay Lake grid (not previously covered) as well as the north eastern portion of the Fay Lake grid that will be cut and surveyed to follow the strike extension of the Sunrise conductor to the eastern shore of Fay Lake. Drill testing of designed targets will follow up confirmation of Airborne conductors by ground geophysics on the Fay Lake property subject to a successful financing and direct consultation with Kiciwapa Cree Nation. Also planned is detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting on the Fay Lake Property on a small portion of the Redwin volcanogenic massive sulphide horizon that remains unmapped but contains conductors.</p><p>Separate to the VMS exploration at Fay Lake above, gold exploration through mapping and prospecting of the western portion of the Puffy Lake Mine style gold mineralization trend, east of the Railroad. Approximately 10-line kilometers is planned on this trend where samples assayed up to 14.33 g/t Au, to evaluate its on strike continuity. The gold potential at Koscielny Lake located at the eastern end of the property south of the Puffy Lake Gold Mine will also be assessed. Here mineralization contained values of up to 11.81 g/t Au (0.38 oz/ton Au) over one meter (J. Pearson, Sept. 4, 2024, National Instrument 43-101 Fay Lake technical report).</p><p>North Star</p><p>Planned Program</p><p>Line cutting and refurbishing old Grids</p><p>Refurbish and recut the Grid from South of the North Star deposit on Line 46 N to Line 59 N between Baselines 46 E and Tie Line 59 E for both mapping and drilling purposes. This portion of the grid is almost 25 years old and overgrown to obliterated as it was cut a few years (12) after a forest fire.</p><p>Geological Mapping, Prospecting and Sampling</p><p>The Grids from Lines 59+50 N south to L 46 N will require geological remapping and detailed sampling to bring it up to the standard and detail of the northern grids that cover the Gold Rock and Richard Veins, with special emphasis on the section in between the North Star and Gold Rock deposits.</p><p>Drilling</p><p>Selective infill drilling, as well as down plunge drilling on the Gold Rock Vein with a view of completing a resource estimate and NI 43-101 compliant technical report (never undertaken). Ultimately the plan is to drill off enough tonnes that the combined resource of the North Star and Gold Rock Vein Structures, with sufficient grade, will warrant to bring it to a prefeasibility study. Even if successful on the first pass, this objective will require a few additional drill programs.</p><p>Melgurd Lake</p><p>On the Melgurd Lake property, following up detailed analysis of Airborne Geophysical conductors on strike with the Shotts Lake deposit and the encouragement found in the felsic volcanic package with VMS style alteration in the 2023-2024 field work, further work is planned to ground truth these conductors. Detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting will be carried out over these conductors on the Keep Lake grid with follow up reports. Funds will also be used for corporate purposes.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Stephen L.

As if to illustrate the point, firefighters were confronted with a hair-raising scene on Wednesday afternoon as a grass fire at a Gillies residential property burned several hay bales, damaged vehicles and nearly crossed a local highway. </p><p>\"Upon arrival it was determined the fire had spread to multiple fronts, threatening the highway, the bush line, several structures, and an abundance of vehicles and farm implements in the yard,\" Nolalu fire Chief Sarah Shoemaker said. \"With the multitude of hay bales involved, we had to spend significant time having to tear those apart to be able to extinguish them, and that took an additional four hours,\" Shoemaker added. Nobody was injured in the Highway 595 blaze, which is believed to have been sparked by a grinding device. \"The working theory is that a spark from the grinder likely smoldered until the winds picked up over lunch time,\" Shoemaker said. She added: \"We cannot say that this is definitely the cause, but (it is) probable.\" Firefighters were able to save a home on the property located in the area of Neva Road and Highway 608. Gillies and Neebing fire departments also responded to the scene. \"We'd like to remind everyone that especially at this time of year, even the smallest spark can have unintended consequences\" Shoemaker said. \"Please take care if using tools like grinders (and) if you must use them, do so on a surface that is non-combustible,\" she added. Meanwhile, there was no word Thursday whether the Ministry of Natural Resources is contemplating any restricted fire zones in parts of NorthwesternOntario. The risk for fires ranged from high to moderate. \"The wildland fire hazard ranges from high in the Red Lake, Kenora and Fort Frances sectors to mainly moderate throughout the Dryden, Sioux Lookout, Thunder Bay and Nipigon sectors,\" an Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services agency bulletin said late on Wednesday. According to Environment Canada, the mercury in Thunder Bay is set to soar to 25 C by Monday, about 10 degrees warmer than normal in the city for this time of year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ff2317da0bd746d4adc8abe8ebc1b2b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FSD-1613-RRVW-P45S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"409\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 9, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fire Chief Brad Hutton, Deputy Chief Doug Bennett, plus firefighters Brendan Gaudet and Chance Joanette answered the call, pitching in equipment and human resources from May 31 to June 10.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAt first, we were on property control, and then we ended up putting out fires around little areas and villages, attacking forest fires,\u201d Hutton explained. \u201cWe took our tanker truck up\u2014we have a 2,000-gallon tanker truck\u2014so we did lots of nursing ponds, running sprinkler systems to maintain keeping buildings cool. We did that for the first couple of days intensely.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Redvers firefighters began their duties in Weyakwin, then ventured to other areas such as Nelson Bay, Ramsey Bay, Malanosa, Timber Bay, and various areas along Montreal Lake.</p><p>\u201cThe forest fires were burning real hard and hot, but you didn\u2019t see quite as much flame over top of the trees, as we have noticed before, but the amount of hectares that were burnt was huge,\u201d Hutton recalled. \u201cSometimes, going down cut lines and trails, some of the roads we went down, it was like driving in like a blizzard or in extremely foggy conditions. But when you\u2019re up close, kind of right in the area where the fires are burning, the heat and the smoke pretty much goes up high and for the most part, it\u2019s a little cleaner air down below than what you would think it is. Obviously, we wore masks because there\u2019s definitely stuff burning. The other thing too that we had to be cautious of was of lots of wildlife being displaced, we saw numerous amounts of bears.\u201d</p><p>Helicopters and small spray bombers dropping water from above was also a common sight. While firefighters do train constantly for the unexpected, fighting a forest fire brought a whole different strategy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an entirely different plan of attack, and a lot of times it\u2019s more a case of just control and slow it down, because you\u2019re not really going to get it out, for the most part,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cThey rely on the cut lines and bulldozers to stop it, but you\u2019re not 100 per cent getting the fire out. It\u2019s more just controlling it so it doesn\u2019t carry on into villages and towns.\u201d</p><p>The number of wildfires has been well above the five year average in Saskatchewan with 267 documented this year as compared to average of 166. More than $4 million has been given directly to residents in the areas affected, plus the provincial government is distributing $500 in financial assistance to individuals impacted. As of June 24, the Canadian Red Cross has also raised $2.5 million for their 2025 Saskatchewan Wildfires Appeal, which does not include the matching federal dollars for donations made between May 30 to June 29.</p><p>Mixed emotions\u00a0</p><p>Uncontrolled wildfires are a dangerous situation, but Hutton said it felt good to be able to help.</p><p>\u201cI do enjoy it because I\u2019m that kind of a person that likes helping people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a good sight. Like I said, we didn\u2019t run into any loss of life or anything, just loss of properties and then obviously, the good side of it is all the sprinklers and stuff we maintained and operated\u2014a lot of properties were saved.\u201d</p><p>So how did a small crew from Redvers end up fighting forest fires hundreds of kilometres away in northern Saskatchewan? According to Hutton, it was an answer to a call.</p><p>\u201cThe SPSA (Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency) did put a call out, there were some emails that went out asking and requesting if you had equipment, what you had for equipment, what you had for manpower,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen you basically applied by an email stating what you had. We put that we had a tanker truck and two members. I did work a little bit with the Carlyle Fire Chief as well, they said they\u2019d take their wildland truck, so we put it together as a package\u2014go with a tanker and a wildland truck with four members between the two departments.\u201d</p><p>The pumpers and smaller trucks were much sought after, with the key part of the operation being how exactly they are utilized.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s demand for little trucks to get in and out, and then tanker trucks are always a value to get lots of volume to where they need it,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cYou started looking at how they operate, with the bulldozers and flattening down like swaths of trees to put fire breaks up. Sometimes they\u2019d send the little wildland trucks down there. You\u2019re definitely not going down there with a 2,000 gallon tank or truck. You\u2019d never get in or out of there with the sand up there.\u201d</p><p>Another hazard to be ever-mindful of is falling trees as the smouldering trunks in the soft soil can easily give way to gravity.</p><p>\u201cThe trees don\u2019t root real deep either, so you got to be pretty cautious, too, because it\u2019s smouldering and burning in the bottom the tree stumps,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cOften, there will just be random trees tipping over and falling over, so they\u2019re a concern, too. You always had to be cautious. If there was any wind at all, you really didn\u2019t want to be in the forest because there\u2019s toppling trees everywhere. Even when you look down cut lines and alongside of the road, lots of times there will be trees that just randomly fall over. The bottoms will burn out and they just topple over.\u201d</p><p>Home safe</p><p>The firefighters from Redvers went up in groups of two, switching out partway through the 11 long days, ranging from 12 to 19 hours. In total, they posted 146 hours, but also came home with new insights. One idea in particular was about obtaining a protective gel the crew prepared and used to slow down the fires.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was a gel protective coating we sprayed on power poles at properties so they were more flame retardant,\u201d Hutton explained. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t burn or heat up as quick. We were discussing getting some of that gel to have at our department because say you have a house fire in Redvers, you could be mixing that up in your little wildland truck and spray the house down beside that would help prevent siding and shingles from melting.\u201d</p><p>Redvers Fire and Rescue is also in the midst of fundraising for a new truck, anticipated to arrive in the first quarter of 2026.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe new truck is going to be a 2026 model,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cThey did say 18 month delivery, so I think they\u2019re going to be about on track with their 18 month delivery.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-28c35fc806734828ad926d488098bea2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G70-8WJ3-RT5F-T2MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><timeReceived>12:43 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 7, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(TSX.V: NAM | OTCQB: NMTLF | FSE: P7J) (\"NAM\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. This support will enable NAM to advance exploration at its Newfoundland Gold-Antimony Division project in the St. Alban's region of south-central Newfoundland.</p><p>In July, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador's Mineral Incentive Program officially approved NAM's application as filed, designating it as a \"Critical Minerals as a Primary Exploration Target\" project. This prioritization ensures eligibility for CMA and PCMA funding.</p><p>Application Highlights</p><p>The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>Total exploration budget of approximately$225,000, with potential rebate support of up to 40% of eligible costs, capped at $150,000 for island-based projects;</p><p>The Antimony Ridge property hosts the Antimony Ridge Showing, the Golden Grit Showing, and the Southwest Brook Ag Showing;</p><p>Eligible exploration activities include geological mapping, prospecting, soil, till, and lake sediment sampling, and targeted channel sampling and backpack drilling;</p><p>The prerequisite exploration permits have been approved and received;</p><p>Located close to hydroelectric power and communities, with skilled workforce and reliable road/trail access; and</p><p>Area historically explored for gold and base metals (copper, lead, zinc).</p><p>Harry Barr, NAM Chairman and CEO comments, \"NAM is very grateful for the support of the Provincial JEA by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and for CMA financial support by the Government of Canada, for NAM's antimony and gold exploration program in the Province. The generous support further strengthens NAM's ability to hire local personnel and quickly advance its goal of discovering new critical metal deposits in underexplored areas of Newfoundland in 2025 and beyond. We are preparing for our upcoming Phase 2 exploration program, which will follow-up on the results of the very successful Phase 1 exploration program completed in May-June 2025.\"</p><p>Phase 2 Field Program Plan</p><p>In follow-up to the Phase 1 results1, a focused field program is ongoing and will include:</p><p>Additional detailed geological mapping and mineral prospecting, rock sampling, and structural analysis of mineralized trends;</p><p>Channel sampling and backpack drilling of Antimony Ridge and any promising discoveries; and</p><p>Geochemical surveys (soil, till, and lake sediment sampling), with approximately 250 to 1000 samples across prospective zones and areas with limited bedrock exposure.</p><p>The budget for these exploration activities is $225,000.</p><p>On June 19, 2025, NAM. entered into an Option Agreement with Mr. Ross Collier to acquire a 100% interest in the mineral rights to the Antimony Ridge Property (Mineral Licence #035215M)2. This newly acquired ground directly adjoins NAM Licence #038953M (NAM's 100% owned Citadel Property - Figure 1) and covers highly prospective terrain with documented antimony, base metal, and gold occurrences. NAM plans to fully integrate the Antimony Ridge Property into its 2025 Field Exploration Program, with targeted activities including backpack drilling and in-fill soil sampling over and around the main Antimony Ridge occurrence. The inclusion of Antimony Ridge significantly enhances the geological potential of NAM's property portfolio and strengthens its alignment with Newfoundland and Labrador's critical mineral exploration priorities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/9f82acf32a23f6355be8bce9714c435b.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/9f82acf32a23f6355be8bce9714c435b.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Figure 1. Location of NAM's Antimony Ridge and Citadel Property in the St Alban's area of south-central Newfoundland. The total area of the two properties is 3775 hectares.</p><p>About the JEA Program</p><p>The JEA Program is designed to expand the mineral inventory of Newfoundland and Labrador by supporting discovery of new mineral deposits. The program also aims to advance known deposits toward NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources, in order to strengthen the Province's position as a mineral exploration space of choice. The JEA is funded through a combination of $1.3M in Provincial Grant Funds, $1.3M from Critical Mineral Assistance (\"CMA\"), and $1.3M in Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (\"PCMA\"). Funding is provided to junior companies as rebates for eligible exploration activities. Junior companies conducting critical mineral exploration may qualify for larger rebates through the CMA and PCMA streams. Subject to budget approval for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, JEA rebates 40% of eligible exploration costs up to a maximum (including any CMA and PCMA) of $150,000 per project in Newfoundland.</p><p>At this point, the amount of the potential JEA program rebate is $71,974.69. The rebate is paid when all the final exploration reports have been received, reviewed and accepted by the Newfoundland Department of Industry, Energy and Technology.</p><p>Press Release References</p><p>1.

Nevertheless, the Qualified Person considers that drilling and analytical results were completed to industry standard practices. The reader is cautioned that mineral occurrences, prospects and deposits on neighbouring properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Company's properties. This information may provide an indication of the exploration potential of the Properties, but might not be representative of exploration results.</p><p>About NAM's PGE Division</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of green metal projects in North America.The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>About NAM's Lithium Division</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026.The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB.This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities.Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and mid-tier mining companies through to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for its River Valley Palladium Project and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are welcome to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

Albert\u2019s son Gerald, who had just turned 15, was the only other person with him. The two were living in a large tent and were busy building a small cabin of which they had the walls up and openings cut out.

Lately, people are reluctant to do so, with all the bear activity, Alderliesten added.</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what the adjacent River\u2019s Edge Community has been trying to prevent \u2013 bears and vulnerable people caught in a dangerous situation beside a park meant to protect wildlife, not serve as an unmanaged, unmitigated encampment,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWe feel stuck in a multi-jurisdictional whack-a-mole while the forest fire danger keeps getting worse year after year. It\u2019s past time for co-ordinated action.\u201d</p><p>Oceanside RCMP received two complaints about the camp in May, according to Sgt. Shane Worth. Unless people are committing a criminal offence, police officers generally tell the campers to move along, he added. RCMP also engage with bylaw officers and other agencies such as MOTT to discourage future camping.</p><p>Residents like Alderliesten want the government to put up barriers to prevent RVs and campers from entering, and place \u2018No overnight camping\u2019 signs. \u201cThey have to do something, it\u2019s just getting worse every year,\u201d she said. In late April, local outreach workers connected with homeless individuals as part of the provincial Point in Time Count, according to Susanna Newton, executive director of the Society of Organized Services. In previous years, the count results have been released by the provincial government in August.</p><p>The 2021 count identified 103 people experiencing homelessness, up from 87 people in 2021.</p><p>MOTT is aware of the concerns about bear activity, saying wildlife concerns should be reported directly to the Conservation Officer Service through the RAPP (Report All Poachers and Polluters) line at 1-877-952-7277 or online at gov.bc.ca/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TPAQBN-news20250528PTBA0004767964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TPAQBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX9-D3C3-RS55-G1N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484151</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

There's a chance of rain over the weekend in the region, where officials said fires also burned uncontained in Pennsylvania on Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its most recent update, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said about 60% of the fire spread over nearly 24 square miles (62 square kilometers) in the southern part of the state was contained. No injuries or deaths have been reported, but buildings have burned along with cars.</p><p>Suspect is arrested in connection with wildfire</p><p>Officials have charged a 19-year-old man from the area with starting the blaze that led to the wildfire.</p><p>Prosecutors on Thursday said Joseph Kling, 19, from Waretown, New Jersey, was arrested and charged with arson and aggravated arson, saying he lit wooden pallets on fire and left the area before they were fully put out.</p><p>A public defender representing him during the hearing said she had \u201cnothing further\u201d when asked by a judge.</p><p>\u201cThe New Jersey Office of the Public Defender cannot comment on pending cases at this early stage of the legal process, other than to remind everyone that individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise in a court of law,\" said Cristina LiBassi a spokesperson with the Office of the Public Defender in an email Friday.</p><p>Attempts to reach Kling by phone were not successful.</p><p>Blaze first spotted when smoke appears amid the pines</p><p>Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn\u2019t been put out.</p><p>Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said \u201cwe can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d He declined further comment on why authorities believe the man they arrested was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing.</p><p>It's forest fire season in the pinelands, a wilderness that encompasses more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon. Firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a monthslong drought in the region.</p><p>New Jersey is most densely populated state</p><p>New Jersey is the nation\u2019s most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby, although parts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles (about 62 square kilometers) on Thursday.</p><p>Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years in New Jersey, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).</p><p>Jim and Lenore Thoms, who own a business in an industrial park near the blaze, called the fire \u201ca very scary experience\u201d and praised the efforts of firefighters.</p><p>\u201cThe firefighters were phenomenal, they saved this whole park,\u201d Jim Thoms said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the way things were going on, you might not have seen any buildings at all.\u201d</p><p>The fire is roughly 54 miles (87 kilometers) south of New York City. It\u2019s about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Philadelphia.</p><p>Firefighters also battle blazes in Pennsylvania</p><p>Some 115 miles (186 kilometers) to the west of Philadelphia in south-central Pennsylvania, firefighters battled two fires around Michaux State Forest covering a combined 2.1 square miles (5.4 square kilometers), authorities said.</p><p>A spokesman for Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said warm, dry conditions and winds made the fires difficult to contain, although no structures had yet been consumed by midday Friday.</p><p>On Thursday, New York officials warned of higher-than-normal pollution levels were possible in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island\u2019s Nassau and Suffolk counties.</p><p>Officials said New Jersey's fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).</p><p>Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.</p><p>The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. In the region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists Tassanee Vejpongsa in Waretown, New Jersey, and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-aa6c4f3f328b5cfdc535ec455c53b2d3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FND-DPT3-RVM5-W4HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><timeReceived>03:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He promised before the election to move forward with a \"one project, one review\" approach by recognizing assessments conducted by the provinces and territories.\u00a0</p><p>The federal government unveiled its proposed emissions cap regulations late last year. They would compel upstream oil and gas operations to reduce emissions to 35 per cent below where they were in 2019 by sometime between 2030 and 2032.\u00a0</p><p>\"Partnership is a theme for our discussion this morning,\" Carney said, accompanied by Energy Minister Tim Hodgson, Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada and U.S. trade and Emergency Management Minister Eleanor Olszewski.</p><p>\"It's a critical time for our country. The world's certainly more divided and dangerous and the imperative of making Canada an energy superpower in all respects has never been greater. We will do everything we can at the federal government level to support those partnerships.\"</p><p>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith was asked on her weekend radio show if she was concerned that the federal throne speech didn't include a mention of pipelines.</p><p>\"He may not have said the words 'oil and gas' and he may not have said the word 'pipeline,' but conventional energy means oil and gas, and the only way to get it to market efficiently is through pipelines,\" said Smith, who says she's hoping for a one-on-one with Carney at Monday's First Ministers conference in Saskatoon.</p><p>Smith also praised Carney for being more willing to engage with the premiers on issues of national importance than his predecessor Justin Trudeau. She was coy when asked about consequences if Carney doesn't deliver, saying she prefers to be optimistic.\u00a0</p><p>Carney also took a moment on Sunday to thank the Department of National Defence, the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and volunteers involved in fighting extensive wildfires and co-ordinating large-scale evacuations.</p><p>\"The good news is those are proceeding well at this stage but of course it's not over until it's over and we're at the start of the forest fire season across the country,\" he said. \"So we'll stay committed to doing everything that we can with partners.\"</p><p>_With files from Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 1, 2025.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-73f33430735d4ec5b063b1b3a5280ef0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FY9-B7T3-RYT7-V22P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><timeReceived>10:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 1, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

You could actually hear the roar of the fire from across the river.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m glad that we were able to get everyone out within three or four days, versus the 2021 evacuation that took us five or six days to get everyone out.\u201d</p><p>Scott said this is Wabaseemoong\u2019s third evacuation since he became chief in 2019.</p><p>Having to evacuate repeatedly \u201ctakes a toll on everyone,\u201d he remarked, saying it\u2019s like post-traumatic stress disorder for some community members.</p><p>People are \u201con the edge of their seats\u201d every spring as the fire season starts, he said.</p><p>Kenora Chiefs Advisory communications manager Abbie Siroishka said Wabaseemoong members have shown \u201cstrength and resilience\u201d in the face of the wildlands fires and the evacuation.</p><p>As of Sunday morning there are \u201c17 or 18\u201d Wabaseemoong members on the reserve, Scott said, adding that some of them are staff maintaining infrastructure.</p><p>There has been no property damage and no medical incident directly related to the fires, the chief said.</p><p>He said a Kenora non-profit group has taken some dogs out of the community, and some of the community members still in Wabaseemoong are feeding dogs that remain there.</p><p>A news release from the First Nation said it \u201chas established teams at each evacuation site\u201d to provide services to members while the evacuation is ongoing.</p><p>An update from Ontario\u2019s Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services on Saturday evening said the wildfire dubbed Kenora 20, west of Wabaseemoong, was 31,000 hectares in size at the time and not under control.</p><p>The Kenora 14 fire north of Wabseemoong was sized at 1,600 hectares and also considered not under control.</p><p>Scott said a three-hectare breakaway blaze from the Kenora 20 fire was about 1.3 kilometres from his community as of Sunday morning.</p><p>\u201cThere remains no access to the community, and we cannot stress enough how dangerous it is to try and go to Wabaseemoong currently,\u201d the First Nation\u2019s news release said.</p><p>\u201cThere are barriers established at the community side access roads, so anyone trying to enter will be asked to turn around.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3cfc3934ccc14707b8eb481afc244dd6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FV9-RMH3-RRRJ-G07D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><timeReceived>09:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 18, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This event was possibly the first mountain rescue by helicopter in Canada. It made news across Canada, but was soon forgotten and lost to history, until The Forest History Association of BC recently published an in-depth story about this interesting event.</p><p>In September of 1950, Albert David Flowers (who had served in the First and Second World Wars) was working at a remote Forestry lookout on the top of Azure Mountain in Wells Gray Park where his job was to send out daily fire and weather reports. Albert's son Gerald, who had just turned 15, was the only other person with him. The two were living in a large tent and were busy building a small cabin of which they had the walls up and openings cut out. Unexpectedly, Albert was hit in the leg by a falling rock while clearing a trail. When the leg got progressively worse they realized he needed medical treatment and radioed for help.</p><p>A helicopter from Okanagan Air Services was then called away from a job moving equipment and personnel up to what is now called the Lucky Four Mine south of Hope, B.C., to pick up the injured Albert and quickly transport him to medical attention in Kamloops.</p><p>The helicopter was an open cockpit Bell 47B-3 (CF-FZX) which had been lightened so it could reach high elevations. It's pilot was D.K. \u2018Deke' Orr, who had been trained by the famous pilot Carl Agar (winner of the Trans-Canada (McKee) Trophy in 1950).</p><p>Deke had to fly his helicopter to a 6,200 ft. elevation, and then bring the helicopter down on the virtual top of the mountain in strong winds. An impressive feat to be sure, and possibly the first mountain rescue by helicopter in Canada.</p><p>When the helicopter arrived Gerald had to cut down a number of small trees to clear enough of an area so the helicopter could land safely. Albert was then loaded into the helicopter and they departed.</p><p>Gerald took several photographs as they prepared to leave and also when Deke lifted off to fly Albert to the Kamloops Hospital for treatment.</p><p>Since the helicopter only had two seats and no space for another person, Gerald was left to his own devices to provide a mode of transportation off the mountain.</p><p>Gerald says the next day he walked down the mountain, took a short boat ride and then walked out of Wells Gray Park, a distance of about 40-45 km in two days. He took a gun to fend off black bears, etc., but tells he soon found out that the ammunition he brought turned out to be duds!</p><p>Gerald Flowers would later write this story down, and he also added a number of the photographs that he had taken and saved for seven decades. The story is now in a 26 page PDF document Canada's First Mountain Helicopter Rescue \u2013 1950, by Gerald and Ken Flowers (2020) and is downloadable at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fhabc.org\">www.fhabc.org</url>.</p><p>Gerald later experienced many other adventures growing up and living in British Columbia, and he has written many down, but not yet published.</p><p>The Forest History Association of BC have published a number of other interesting articles available on their website at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fhabc.org\">www.fhabc.org</url> and also through their Facebook Group <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/fhabc\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/fhabc</url></p><p>Source: Barriere History, an article posted by Ken Millar on the BC Forest Fire Lookouts Facebook page, and The Forest History Association of BC: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fhabc.org\">www.fhabc.org</url></p><p>Copyright 2025 Clearwater Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20250524PNT4728214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FWK-KDW3-S0HC-62CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Our thoughts are with the people of this Webequie First Nation and other Nishnawbe Aski Nation communities across the province being threatened by Ontario wildfires,\" the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service posted on Facebook Wednesday.</p><p>\"We would also like to take a moment to thank our NAPS officers who have stepped up during this time of crisis and provided their communities with the services they expect and deserve.</p><p>\"We've dispatched additional officers to Webequie, who are now also helping to ensure community safety is maintained and that evacuated residents receive the help they need during this stressful time,\" the post says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fires 'gaining size very fast'</emphasis></p><p>Chris Marchand, a fire information officer with Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services who is based in Dryden, said the 2025 wildfire season can already be characterized as a busy year.</p><p>\"We had a very early start in May and several weeks with rather minimal precipitation across the northwest,\" Marchand told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-84-up-north/clip/16150482-the-latest-northwestern-ontarios-wildfires\">CBC's Up North on Wednesday.</url></p><p/><p>\"One real concern is how receptive our landscape is becoming to fires caused by lightning - not only are our forest fuels extremely dry, but so is the ground. And then that really makes it easier for lightning fires to get started, for fires in general to burn deeper and require more effort and resources to extinguish.\"</p><p>Marchand said firefighters from British Columbia have been lending their support in the region, but one challenge is that \"the fires that we're finding are gaining size very fast.\"</p><p>\"In a lot of situations, air attack has been required with water bombers to really reduce the intensity of these fires when they're initially discovered, to allow crews to get in quickly and to make sure that they don't become larger problems,\" Marchand said.</p><p>Though there has been scattered rainfall over the past few days, the region remains dry, said Marchand, which is why it's important for people to continue obeying the rules of the restricted fire zone in place - namely, not lighting campfires, burn barrels or burn piles.</p><p>Drones have also become an issue since they can hinder\u00a0aerial operations around wildfires, he added.</p><p>\"The presence of a drone presents a danger to air crews and can result in the cancellation of an air attack mission that is usually being sent to protect lives or property - so please, no drones within nine kilometres of a wildland fire,\" said Marchand.</p><p>More information about rules within restricted fire zones <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires\">can be found on the province's website.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadathunderbaywebequiefirstnationevacuationcontinues17552603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYX-0K73-RXCS-032T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><timeReceived>10:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

We can move out the animals we already have and make space to help if the call is made.\u201d</p><p>TDHS is part of the Ontario Animal Welfare Network (OAWN), a collaborative group of humane societies and SPCAs across the province. When word spread about animals at risk in Sandy Lake due to the fires, several members, including Timmins, committed to helping.</p><p>\u201cThey reached out to me and some of the OAWN members, and we determined that we would all try and help out as best we could, to support through these really scary times for the people up there and for the animals,\u201d said Lynn Michaud, executive director for TDHS,</p><p>TDHS has responded to similar crises before, including the annual spring evacuations from Kashechewan due to flooding. Years ago, they even came close to evacuating their own shelter because of an approaching wildfire.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe were almost victims of one ourselves several years back, where we had to reach out to our sister shelters to help us empty our shelter as the fire creeped closer,\u201d Romain said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd we were lucky that nothing happened, but we're very grateful for the help and assistance we received from other shelters to make sure animals are safe.\u201d</p><p>SEE: 'We understand': Creemergency supporting forest fire evacuees RELATED: 'Our hearts are big': Town steps up for Northern fire evacuees         </p><p>The animals that will be placed in foster homes are those currently in the shelter, who have already been vetted and behaviourally assessed.</p><p>\u201cWe've had a lot of people reaching out and wonderfully offering to take the animals that are coming from up north. The issue is that we need to ensure the safety of people and the safety of the animals, so we are not prepared or comfortable to take animals that are unknown to us and place them in foster homes,\u201d Michaud said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, the plan is to move our current animals into those foster homes.\u201d</p><p>The application process includes a home visit, a criminal record check, and matching the right animal with the right foster environment. TDHS provides food, supplies, and covers veterinary costs for all fostered pets.</p><p>\u201cAll they really need to do is open up their home,\u201d said Romain. \u201cBut they always have our support in whatever they need or any questions they have.\u201d</p><p>While the number of animals from Sandy Lake remains uncertain, Romain highlighted the ongoing need for foster homes, even beyond emergencies.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of animals who need temporary homes \u2026 This is a program we\u2019d love to see continue,\u201d she said.</p><p>In addition to foster homes, TDHS is in urgent need of donations.\u00a0</p><p>Michaud said the shelter is always short on wet food for cats, kittens, puppies and dogs, as well as laundry detergent, dish soap, leashes, collars, and crates. Monetary donations are also welcome.</p><p>Most of the animals expected from Sandy Lake are surrendered pets, animals whose owners made the difficult decision not to reclaim them, Michaud said. Those animals will be re-homed through TDHS. Pets whose families hope to be reunited with them will remain in the north, closer to their owners.</p><p>Michaud said having an emergency preparedness plan in place \u201cis vital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving those emergency supplies and having those emergency backups and having those in place, I think really makes a huge difference when you have pets, because we have a lot of people resources, but the animal part always kind of comes up as a bit of surprise for people,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it's so stressful for people when they're dealing with that, right?

It's past time for co-ordinated action.\"</p><p>Oceanside RCMP received two complaints about the camp in May, according to Sgt. Shane Worth. Unless people are committing a criminal offence, police officers generally tell the campers to move along, he added. RCMP also engage with bylaw officers and other agencies such as MOTT to discourage future camping.</p><p>Residents like Alderliesten want the government to put up barriers to prevent RVs and campers from entering, and place \u2018No overnight camping' signs.</p><p>\"They have to do something, it's just getting worse every year,\" she said.</p><p>In late April, local outreach workers connected with homeless individuals as part of the provincial Point in Time Count, according to Susanna Newton, executive director of the Society of Organized Services.

of northwestern Ontario due to the continuing threat of wildfires in the area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chris Marchand, a fire information officer in the northwest region for the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services Branch, said Kenora 20 \"remains a significant fire of concern\" in the northwest region.</p><p>The fire, which originated in Ingolf on Monday afternoon, has since travelled approximately 43 kilometres to the north and has now approached to within 2.5 kilometres of the community of Wabaseemoong, Marchand told CBC News Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\"The community underwent an evacuation yesterday and at the moment there's just a few key personnel and firefighting staff remaining in the town,\" Marchand said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Today we're seeing CL-415 waterbombers providing air attack on the parts of the fire that are closest to the community, and crews on the ground are setting up sprinkler systems on the town's critical infrastructure and other priority structures.\"</p><p/><p>Marchand said Ingolf is a cottage subdivision that is in Ontario but is usually accessed via Highway 321 from Manitoba.</p><p>On Tuesday the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry [MNRF] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires\">established an evacuation order and travel access restrictions</url> to areas near the Kenora 20 and Kenora 14 fires to ensure public safety and effective firefighting.\u00a0</p><p>Also on Tuesday, the leadership of Wabaseemoong Independent Nation issued an evacuation notice urging people to leave.</p><p>\"Kenora Fire 14 is approximately 1,379 hectares and burning roughly 12 kilometres north of Wabaseemoong,\" the notice reads. \"Kenora Fire 20 is now over 8,000 hectares, increasing rapidly and causing significant smoke and fire risk to Wabaseemoong and its members.\"</p><p>The notice from Wabaseemoong chief and council said they want to assure the community that people's safety and health is their top priority.</p><p>\"Leadership is working diligently with multiple levels of government,\u00a0MNRF, as well as community partners to establish all levels of support we can for members,\" the notice continues.</p><p>'Extreme fire behaviour and really fast rates of spread'</p><p>Meanwhile, Marchand said \"extreme fire behaviour and really fast rates of spread have seen this fire grow to approximately 23,281 hectares since Monday afternoon and it remains not under control.\"</p><p>He said officials still do not know what caused the fire, but FireRanger crews and bucketing helicopters are currently working in the Ingolf area where it originated, maintaining sprinkler systems on the local structures and looking to where they can establish hose lines in that area.</p><p>Marchand said while he can confirm that there have been structures lost in the fire, specific information about those losses were not immediately available.</p><p>Looking ahead, Marchand said there is the prospect of some meaningful rainfall in the fire area, approximately 15 to 20 mm from Thursday into Friday, \"which we're hoping will materialize,\" adding that \"a rainfall event like that would help to moderate the extreme fire behavior we're observing and and buy us a little bit of time to get FireRanger crews established on some of these fires.\"</p><p>New fires</p><p>The\u00a0MNRF said six new fires were confirmed in the Northwest Region as of the evening of May 13:\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Several communities were evacuated as a precaution as the smoke turned the skies over Jerusalem gray.</p><p>The fire has burned about 5,000 acres (20 square kilometers) and is the most significant fire Israel has had in the past decade, according to Tal Volvovitch, a spokesperson for Israel\u2019s fire and rescue authority. She said the fire has \u201cmiraculously\u201d not damaged any homes.</p><p>Israel\u2019s fire and rescue authority warned the public to stay away from parks or forests, and to be exceptionally careful while lighting barbecues. Thursday is Israel\u2019s Independence Day, which is typically marked with large family cookouts in parks and forests.</p><p>At least 12 people were treated in hospitals on Wednesday, mainly due to smoke inhalation, while another 10 people were treated in the field, Magen David Adom Ambulance services said.</p><p>Italy, Croatia, Spain, France, Ukraine, and Romania were sending planes to help battle the flames, while several other countries, including North Macedonia and Cyprus, were also sending water-dropping aircraft. Israeli authorities said 10 firefighting planes were operating on Thursday morning, with another eight aircraft to arrive during the course of the day.</p><p>Israel's fire and rescue authority lifted the evacuation order on approximately a dozen towns in the Jerusalem hills on Thursday.</p><p>Three Catholic religious communities who were forced to evacuate from their properties on Wednesday were also able to return on Thursday, said Farid Jubran, the spokesperson for the Latin Patriarchate. He said their agricultural lands, including vineyards and olive trees, suffered heavy damage, and some of the buildings were damaged. But there were no injuries, and historic churches were not affected.</p><p>The main highway linking Jerusalem to Tel Aviv was opened again on Thursday, a day after the flames had encroached on the road, forcing drivers to abandon their cars and flee in terror. On Thursday morning, broad swathes of burned areas were visible from the highway, while pink anti-flame retardant dusted the top of burned trees and bushes.
