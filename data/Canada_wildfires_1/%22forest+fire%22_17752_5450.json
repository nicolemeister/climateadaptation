It was fuelled by dry conditions in grass, bushes and trees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">''We had consistent 20 kilometre per hour winds, very high temperatures and low humidities. We had what we would consider rank five, which is the highest severity of fire behaviour all day (Wednesday),'' said Steve Roberts, the province's executive director of wildfire management.</p><p>The northern flank of the fire was burning at the southernmost edge of the communities _ the high school property. That was the control point where firefighters were holding the line, said Roberts.</p><p>''Our focus is around the town _ a small point on a big fire, but it's also our critical priority.''</p><p>Roberts said the fire was expanding eastward, away from the communities, and wind was keeping smoke out.</p><p>It was good news for Ed Benoanie, acting chief of Hatchet Lake. He was one of about 15 residents who stayed to help with firefighting efforts after everyone else was airlifted out.</p><p>''The worst has pretty much passed us now, I think,'' said Benoanie. ''The fire was kind of around us on the reserve and it continued to the north. It's still blazing in the north, but right now the smoke is almost clear.''</p><p>Benoanie said there had been fears that homes would be lost.</p><p>''(Wednesday) was like a war zone here. It was ground zero just about, but ... right now we're much safer. It's much better ... that's for sure.''</p><p>Wollaston Lake is about 840 kilometres north of Saskatoon and can only be reached by air at this time of year.</p><p>The fire was first reported to Saskatchewan Environment early Monday evening and was about one square kilometre in size.</p><p>Fifteen aircraft lifted out about 240 people Tuesday after an evacuation order came down. But smoke at the airport Wednesday hampered efforts to remove everyone. Those left behind hunkered down in two schools until military aircraft arrived to help.</p><p>Provincial fire commissioner Duane McKay said almost everyone _ nearly 1,200 people _ had been airlifted out by Thursday morning.</p><p>''The decision to call the military is because this was a very high risk situation, very dynamic and posed serious threat,'' said McKay.</p><p>Four Griffon helicopters ferried residents to Points North, on the other side of the lake, on flights that took about 20 minutes. By sunrise, evacuees were being taken to shelters in Saskatoon on the bigger Hercules aircraft, which hold 96 people each.</p><p>''They seemed tired for the most part,'' said Capt. Chris Jacobson, who piloted one of the Hercules aircraft. ''I think a lot of them had been up for a lot of hours, but they seemed thankful, grateful and in generally good spirits.''</p><p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall thanked everyone involved in the ''difficult and often dangerous task.''</p><p>It's not unusual for the province to move people when there are forest fires in northern areas, but it's usually those considered vulnerable to breathing problems from smoke, such as children and elders. McKay said he believed the last time a community was completely evacuated was in 2005 when fire threatened Stoney Rapids.</p><p>Lightning has been ruled out as the cause of the fire near Wollaston Lake.</p><p>Roberts said the fire was started by human activity, but it's not clear if the action was accidental or intentional. A team of investigators was flown in Thursday afternoon to look at the fire origin site in a forested area near the end of the airstrip, he said.</p><p>The Wollaston Lake fire is still considered out of control.</p><p>''The worst case scenario was we ended up with fire right in the town site, so that was our goal to prevent that. Most of the active fire component actually bypassed the town, went to the east, while we were working that southern flank,'' said Roberts.</p><p>Roberts said the perspective from people on the ground is that fire activity is ''much reduced'' but the threat remains.</p><p>''There is still a fire on the edge of town. We still have a fair bit of work to do to secure those lines, but again we're now looking at things like the cooler weather and lower winds to assist us in doing that.''</p><p>_ By Jennifer Graham in Regina, with files from CJWW in Saskatoon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20110602CPCPG0863</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5310-CSX1-JCBG-908F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31601\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>June 2, 2011 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(CP) - Cool weather Friday put a damper on a brush fire that had threatened a sawmill and pulp mill in northwestern Saskatchewan. Hot, dry winds Thursday sent flames roaring into the yard of the NorSask sawmill, about eight kilometres east of Meadow Lake, where they engulfed about $2 million worth of wood. There were fears the blaze would spread to the $350-million Millar Western pulp mill less than two kilometres down the road. But Duncan Campbell, spokesman for the Saskatchewan forest fire management centre, said Friday cooler weather and overcast skies helped save the day. \"It's being held today,'' Campbell said. \"The mill is in very little danger now.'' Friday morning, the blaze was burning about 200 metres from the sawmill. The day before, the flames had jumped a firebreak and ignited the log pile at the mill. \"It started some miles away and the wind just jumped it right in,'' said Ian Buchanan, the sawmill's sales manager. \"It ignited the logs stacked in the yard \u2026 they've pretty much been consumed.'' RCMP closed part of the highway leading into Meadow Lake Thursday and evacuated several homes near the fire, which burned a total of about 400 hectares of private land. Campbell said the fire was caused by a someone clearing stubble and was spread by winds gusting up to 70 kilometres an hour. Firefighters, assisted by six provincial air tankers, bombarded the fire with retardant to contain the blaze.</p><p>Campbell said the flames will likely take some time to douse completely in the huge piles of logs near the sawmill. \"It's just like charcoal. \"There's about 50,000 cubic metres of logs in there - it'll be smouldering and burning for a while.'' The weekend forecast for the area called for rain. Campbell said the northern Saskatchewan forest will be a tinderbox this summer, the result of below-average rain and snow and five years of low water levels. \"It's very dry - as dry as it's been since 1911,'' he said. \"We're in pretty tough shape.'' He said there have already been 136 fires in the northern half of the province this year, nearly double the usual number. Another fire that broke out Wednesday near Dillon, Sask., 200 kilometres further north, has destroyed about 170 hectares of forest. About 25 people were evacuated from the nearby Indian reserve Thursday, until the blaze was brought under control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199305070319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1993</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4713-26F0-01G6-8114-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"408\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1993 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"1993\"><dateText>May 7, 1993 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DSII</classCode><className>PRIVATE LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N321113MM</classCode><className>SAW MILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001438</classCode><className>PULP INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N322110MM</classCode><className>PULP MILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009WVQ</classCode></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the Forest Fire Danger Rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018061946969495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SX4-MMD1-JDH3-G0WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Six bulldozers and 50 firefighters defended the hamlet's southern limits Saturday as water bombers hammered back the flames enough for the evacuation order to be lifted later in the afternoon.</p><p>Rick Strickland, provincial fire information officer, said several of the residents returned after the winds died down and scattered showers drifted over the fire.</p><p>A fireguard has been established around the perimeter of the town and a municipal fire truck waited on standby to protect the buildings in the community.</p><p>Firefighters are also working to protect another 12 unoccupied summer cottages in the area.</p><p>Chisholm is on the northern boundary of the 120 square kilometre fire that is now under attack from 200 firefighters and a fleet of helicopters, planes and heavy equipment.</p><p>Thirteen residents of Flatbush, about 20 km to the south, remain on evacuation alert, but winds blowing out of the east Saturday have given them some respite.</p><p>\"The wind is going southwest,'' said Strickland. \"It is moving the fire away from Chisholm and the Flatbush area, but who knows what is going to happen tomorrow.''</p><p>About 30 people evacuated from farms north of Flatbush Friday had earlier been allowed to return to their homes, but remain on evacuation alert.</p><p>\"We're dealing with a fire and conditions that could change at a moment's notice,'' said Barb Toker, an Alberta fire spokeswoman at the scene. \"While we're doing good work out here right now, we're taking every precaution.''</p><p>She said the Chisholm fire was the largest fire in Alberta this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Transport Canada investigators were able to return on Saturday to the scene of a plane crash that killed two people who had been helping fight another fire Friday.</p><p>RCMP removed the bodies of the pilot and passenger of a forest fire spotter plane that crashed on the edge of fire burning northeast of Red Earth Creek, but had to evacuate the area when the fire came within a half kilometre.</p><p>RCMP Cst. Cliff Brennan said investigators are still having difficulty assessing the crash site due to adverse weather conditions. Police said smoke had reduced visibility in the area.</p><p>The names of the victims haven't been released.</p><p>The Cessna went down in dense forest in a hilly area.</p><p>Strickland said the passenger in the aircraft was a veteran air attack officer who was mapping out a strategy for water bombers to attack the lightning-caused fire.</p><p>\"He went up there to do an initial attack on that fire,'' he said. \"It is an unfortunate situation.''</p><p>Strickland said grief counsellors have been sent in to help employees and family deal with the situation.</p><p>\"Certainly there's a number of individuals that are affected by this,'' he said.</p><p>Strickland said the deaths are the first involving Alberta firefighters since a firefighter died fighting a blaze near Mariana Lake, south of Fort McMurray, in May, 1995.</p><p>Meanwhile, 488 firefighters continued to fight 18 fires in the province after one of the driest winters in Alberta history. Five fires, including the Chisholm fire, continued to burn out of control Saturday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-200105260064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YX-VM30-01G6-82FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>May 26, 2001 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000061</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000008</classCode><className>ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000061</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A7R6</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT PILOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Looking south along the street a blue curtain closed the far end, and on both the north and east sides a blue tinge obscured the mountains.</p><p>For a moment I debated whether or not to continue our walk, after all the advisories warning seniors or others with breathing problems to stay indoors and above all not over exert themselves in physical activity.</p><p>But I kept walking, knowing how much our daily outing means to both the dogs and myself. They look forward to coming home to a cold drink of water followed by a three or four hour nap in a shady spot. My plan in this hot weather, with or without forest fire smoke, is to loaf the day away watching TV newscasts and commentaries.</p><p>As a concession, I chose a slightly shorter route just in case. By the time we had gone less than three blocks I began to feel slightly dizzy. My eyesight grew fuzzy. Stepping between two trees to leave the open path for a narrow way through bush I hugged one tree to steady myself so I wouldn't scrape my arm on rough bark.</p><p>The atmosphere became slightly less smoky as we turned north, the mountains ahead more sharply outlined. Nonetheless when we reached our regular rest stop &amp;#8212; a low pile of 3 x 12 planks Highways uses to shore up bridges during heavy spring runoff &amp;#8212; roughly one third of the total trail distance, I was eager to sit down as were the dogs. During normal weather, we walk half that 60 minute trail with only two sit-downs. Not today. We took several extra rests including one where we sprawled on the grass of Copper Mountain's upper playing field. The clipped grass felt cool, and the ridge offered a breeze absent on the remainder of the trail where it is enclosed by tall trees, low shrubbery, and hip high grasses and tansy.</p><p>Vegetation of all kinds show signs of prolonged stress whether from strictly water deprivation and too much heat or smoke as well. Underfoot dry curled leaves crackle. Alder are as naked as they usually become only in late September. Tansy looks wizened, blossoms shrunken. I'd venture not a single wild strawberry grew this summer. And everywhere bush is silent &amp;#8211; no little birds singing, even few crows or ravens since their fledglings graduated to unpopulated crown land.</p><p>By some fluke, the two crows who hatched close by are hanging around as though this is their preferred home turf. I call them The Twins. They sit side by side on the hydro wire, sidle along the shed ridgepole one after the other, together invade my yard to ream any tidbits my dogs have left on their beef bones, and generally stay near each other. They say little. Come winter, I can see feeding them for the pleasure of observing their behaviour.</p><p>How much wildlife have we lost to our forest fires?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-3649335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T49-TVW1-F105-652V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Terrace Standard</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 25, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001543</classCode><className>WALKING &amp; JOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000671</classCode><className>EXERCISE &amp; FITNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000575</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D0L8</classCode><className>TELEVISION NEWS SHOWS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Reporter Lexi Bainas has been c ombing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake...</p><p>10 years ago:</p><p>The dream of bringing a frequent and affordable commuter rail service to the Cowichan Valley has hardly hit the end of the tracks, readers of the Lake Cowichan Gazette read on April 11, 2007.</p><p>\"Even though the Malahat Corridor Study eliminated rail as an option to improve the stretch of highway, the ghost is not gone,\" the main story said. \"Jack Peake, Cowichan Valley Regional District board chair [and Island Corridor Foundation co-chair], is very optimistic that a reliable and affordable rail service will be brought to the Valley in the foreseeable future. Right now, members of the Island Corridor Foundation are looking at ways to provide a rail service that would run from Nanaimo to Victoria several times a day.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, if both organizations like what we see, we'll be implementing that service within the next year,\" said Peake.</p><p>For him, \"a rail service would be the \"simplest, easiest\" way to address the issue. Almost every day, he hears from people interested in seeing a rail service here. 'It's an incremental service,' he said. 'This isn't a big cost.'\"</p><p>25 years ago:</p><p>\"Keep your eyes on the sky\" warned The Lake News of April 8, 1992.</p><p>The fear was that \"Fire season could be early this year\".</p><p>There was reason for concern, too, according to the story.</p><p>\"'We need a good rainfall to combat the hazard,'\" said D. J. Eastman, operations manager of the Duncan Forest District...\" Last Friday, the Duncan office had already responded to the 'prescribed' slash fire carried out the previous week by Macmillan Bloedel, which had re-ignited.</p><p>\"According to Eastman, charcoal had caused further burning in the 80 hectare area, fanned by strong winds. At about the same time, a water bomber had been dispatched to a fire on Canadian Forest Products property. A Lake News reader reported that a water bomber had scooped up water in front of her house to douse the fire.\"</p><p>40 years ago:</p><p>\"Youbou vigilantes confront bikers, shotgun blast wounds man\" was the eye-catching headline in the April 13, 1977 issue of The Lake News .</p><p>According to reporter Tony Kant, \"A police spokesman said the man was shot in the foot during an alteraction about 5:30 a.m. Sunday. The shooting victim was with a group of 12 members of a bike club attending a party... The Lake News learned from an observer who wished to remain anonymous, a vigilante group entered the house at the request of someone who feared the gang was assaulting and attempting to rape a local female resident who had gone into the house earlier. The observer said a group of five 'concerned citizens' went to the house with shotguns and rifles to confront the motorcycle gang. By the time the vigilante group got to the house, members of the motorcycle club were the only remaining occupants. According to the spokesman, an altercation developed between one of the vigilantes and a motorcycle gang member and a gun discharged.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-3355468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NBV-2X31-F105-6332-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Cowichan Gazette</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 12, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Motorcycle Clubs</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRGQTQ5QUQ4QTE2NDhEOTk4MzA4RjNGNzJCRTA0NDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Rjc3OTVCRDA5M0U3NEM5NTk1MjkxQzk3Qjg5Q0Y3RDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000C40Z</classCode><className>GUNSHOT WOUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001566</classCode><className>SHOOTINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMP4</classCode><className>VIGILANTISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp; ARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DIDA</classCode><className>COMMUTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002177</classCode><className>RAIL TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>N485112MM</classCode><className>URBAN RAIL SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Forest Fires and its Operations</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pinnacle Renewable Holdings Inc. (\"Pinnacle\" or the \"Company\") today provided an update on its operations in British Columbia amid the current high level of forest fire activity in the province. B.C. Wildfire Services estimates there are currently approximately 600 active wildfires in the province, versus approximately 150 at this time last year. The Company reports that none of its facilities are currently under immediate threat of encroachment from wildfires, however there are wildfires burning in the proximity of some of its production facilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With its long operating history in British Columbia, Pinnacle has extensive experience in managing its operations during seasonal forest fire periods and puts the safety of its employees first and foremost. The Company is closely monitoring the current wildfires in the proximity of its facilities and will provide timely updates on any developments that could impact its operations. In the event of an evacuation or required temporary closure of a facility due to forest fire encroachment, Pinnacle is experienced in managing its network of facilities to ensure customer shipments.</p><p>\"We are adept at managing our network of facilities to adjust for potential temporary operational disruptions. We had to close our Williams Lake production facility for 24 days last year during July and August due to a forest fire and no customer shipments were missed. Our network of facilities was able to absorb this temporary closure and make up the production elsewhere,\" said Vaughan Bassett, Senior Vice President, Sales and Logistics.</p><p>About Pinnacle</p><p>Pinnacle is a rapidly growing industrial wood pellet manufacturer and distributor and the third largest producer in the world. The Company produces renewable fuel for electricity generation in the form of industrial wood pellets, which are used by global utilities and large-scale power generators to produce renewable and reliable baseload power. Pinnacle is a trusted supplier to its customers, who require reliable, high quality fuel supply to maximize utilization of their facilities.

But two and a half months into their trip tested their strength and the trip had to be cut short.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We were close to Cumberland House, past [Prince Albert]. We spent ten days in the smoke,\" Celine said. \"We waited five days for evacuation.\"</p><p>The Mattawa natives were camping in Fort Carlton, in Saskatchewan, when they woke up one morning and noticed a disturbance in the atmosphere.</p><p>\"The first morning, when we woke up, the sun was red,\" Celine said. \"We thought it was just fog. Then we were told that 100 kilometres north of [Prince Albert] were forest fires but all safe.\"</p><p>\"Every day, it got worse and worse to the point where we could not navigate anymore,\" she said. \"We could not see which way the river was going, we could not see around the islands, and that got us into a lot of trouble. We were taking the wrong way, we would end up in a closed channel. We would have to portage, and we have like 500 pounds of gear.\"</p><p>\"It just keep getting worse and worse and worse,\" she said. \"We would have breathing issues. It started effecting our health big time, and not to mention the scariness of it.\"</p><p>\"We were feeling sick, we were feeling afraid, we were feeling trapped,\" she said. \"And it was so hot and humid, and where we were camped, we couldn't really move to somewhere else. It was incredibly hot, it was tick infested.\"</p><p>Everyday proved to be a guessing game, Celine said.</p><p>\"It was like an emergency but it was an emergency waiting to happen,\" she said. \"From one day to the next, you didn't know which way the wind would blow and the minute the wind changed directions, the smoke would come in again.\"</p><p>\"We were in extreme fire zones until Ontario,\" she said. \"So it just wasn't prudent. Safety first, always. As much as we wanted to continue, it was a really heartbreaking decision for us.\"</p><p>The two officially ended their trip on July 14. Their son, Jesse, picked them up and drove them 13 hours to Whitecourt, Alberta, where they will stay until they resume their trip next year.</p><p>Celine said while planning the trip, forest fires wasn't something she had thought of.</p><p>\"The whole time I was planning this trip, forest fires never dawned on me,\" she said. \"It never crossed my mind, and what an oversight.\"</p><p>And forest fires aren't the only tragedy the pair has endured. Throughout their journey, they have suffered two serious and costly dental emergencies and even had a pack stolen from them one night. Although it hasn't been all good, Celine said the trip has changed her life.</p><p>\"It's been an amazing experience,\" she said. \"Some people are saying 'well if it wasn't for bad luck, you guys wouldn't have had any luck at all,' and I totally don't see it that way. Stuff happens, it's life. You just go with the flow and you adapt and you persevere and you come out stronger on the other end.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2015072434172770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GJ0-MDN1-F197-537K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

A few late-season snowflakes flutter over Fort McMurray, their whiteness contrasting against surrounding forests blackened one year ago by the most destructive wildfire in Canadian history.\"You don't know how it feels until you lose it all\", says Steven Menard, 53, holding up a charred pair of his grandson's first ice skates, plucked from the rubble of his home.On May 1, 2016, a brushfire in the Canadian oil patch erupted into a huge blaze that over the following two months would engulf nearly 600,000 hectares of the boreal forest and force the evacuation of an entire city of 100,000 people.Menard arrived in Fort McMurray as a teenager four decades ago. Little remains of the Abasand neighborhood where his house once stood.\"I still cry every day,\" Menard told AFP, confessing that he worries his nightmarish memories of the wildfires will forever haunt him. </p><p>\"But,\" he adds, \"Fort McMurray needs builders, not whiners.\" \"We have to keep a positive attitude,\" he says. With the help of his son-in-law, he has been working day and night since November, rain or shine, to rebuild his house.With a smile, the former industrial equipment salesman says he has lost 42 pounds (19 kg) working on the house. He shows photos of himself on his smartphone with a pudgier face. \"It's therapeutic,\" he says.Leaving the city and relocating was not an option, he said. \"I wasn't going to finish the story this way. We'll leave on our terms, not on Mother Nature's terms.\"That said, he still has no idea what the future holds for him.As winter tiptoes away and yields to spring, several of his former neighbors stop by to check on his progress, and on the rebuilding of their own homes.\"We're putting back together our neighborhood,\" Menard says. \"This devastated land is going to turn green again.\"- Hammers and saws - Elsewhere in Fort McMurray, the buzz of electric saws and the blows of hammers ring out, blending into a din hinting at renewal.Despite the best efforts of government officials and residents, however, one year has not been enough to wipe away the sorrow and erase the scars left by the disaster.Oil company employee Bilal Abbas, 38, saw his home destroyed in the side-view mirror of his car as he fled with his daughter and pregnant wife.\"I would have liked my second daughter to be born here, just like me,\" he says with a smile.Nearly 100,000 people hastily evacuated the city as it was quickly engulfed in flames, grabbing whatever they could as they fled, embers splashing on the hoods of their vehicles.Melissa Blake, the mayor of Fort McMurray, estimates that one year later 15,000 people have still not returned. Many destroyed homes have not been rebuilt. Oil prices plunged prior to the fire and several companies have since then cut back investment in the oil sands, or quit altogether. Without the promise of a job and a better future, many people are hesitant to return.\"Many people prefer to take the payout from the insurance, sell their land and resettle elsewhere to avoid the uncertainty in Fort McMurray,\" said Abbas.All around in the hard-hit Waterways district there are vacant lots that have been cleared of debris. Eight out of 10 homes here were destroyed in the fire.Here and there, wooden frames of new homes under construction point to a rebound. However, it is slow to take off. \"These are all for sale,\" Abbas says of the empty lots. \"But nobody is buying.\"Despite all the uncertainty, he said he returned and is staying in a rented home until he can settle with his insurance company and arrange to have his home rebuilt -- a goal for many that remains up in the air.\"I want to build my new home. I would like to continue being here in this community. But if I'm going to suffer as a result financially, it's going to be tough for me to rebuild,\" he said.\"Even if I'd wanted to go somewhere else, my wife would have never allowed it,\" he quipped, glancing over at Lina who is playing with their two daughters, aged six years and 10 months.\"We love this place too much to leave it.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031493528689256251764500208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NFN-1911-JCMN-Y1H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><timeReceived>5:04 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 30, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001366</classCode><className>PREGNANCY &amp; CHILDBIRTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We are also in the Anthropocene extinction, the current and ongoing extinction of species as a result of human activity. If we continue to do business as usual we will become extinct. I am not willing to let that happen without a fight, so we need to embrace the Green New Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate scientists (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are sounding the alarm. We must keep global warming below 1.5 C. We are seeing the results of global warming all across the globe, including here in Canada. There were devastating forest fires in B.C. in 2017 and 2018, the forest fire that wiped out parts of Fort McMurray, the flooding in Calgary and much more. Those events will continue to escalate, happening with greater frequency and intensity.</p><p>I recently visited a friend in Prince George. She suffered terribly from inhaling forest fire smoke. She is one of many.</p><p>Last year I visited Tombstone Territorial Park in the Yukon. We walked beside the North Klondike River. There was ice on the far side that is millions of years old. We watched parts of it calve off into the river. The temperature was 31C. The Arctic is heating up. Researchers describe how warming in the Arctic, which is heating up 2.4 times faster than the Northern Hemisphere average, is triggering a cascade of changes in everything from when plants flower to where fish and other animal populations can be found.</p><p>Warmer temperatures have shifted forest and tundra growing seasons, boosted rain and snowfall, increased melting, accelerated glaciers and possibly even increased the number of lightning strikes that could increase the risk of Arctic wildfires in the tundra and boreal forest, clearly a signal of climate warming.</p><p>Governments and individuals need to take action. There is plenty we can do.</p><p>-invest in and subsidize renewable energy.</p><p>-retrofit automobile plants to make electric vehicles (which happily I am seeing more and more of on our roads).</p><p>-build more and better public transportation.</p><p>All of the jobs created by these can be filled by many people including people who currently work in the oil and gas industry. The government should provide funding and education for them to transition.</p><p>Indigenous people have important knowledge about mitigating climate change, and their rights should be upheld as stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), including the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), and the 94 Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p><p>Affordable housing is another area that can help to mitigate climate change. There is an excellent example, Nanaimo Aboriginal Centre, that is Passive House Certified, which incorporates initiatives and technologies that reduce energy use and operational costs over conventional building standards. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/media-newsroom/news-releases/2018/affordable-homes-indigenous-people-open-nanaimo\">https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/media-newsroom/news-releases/2018/affordable-homes-indigenous-people-open-nanaimo</url></p><p>The service sector in Canada supports a great number of jobs that are low carbon. The Green New Deal recognizes them and would provide increased funding after years of cuts. Our communities would become stronger and more caring.</p><p>The Green New Deal not only tackles the climate crisis. It includes implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and stopping the rise of racism. Now is the time for us to come together as one and give it everything we've got. Thank you in advance for embracing the Green New Deal.</p><p>Diana Hardacker,</p><p>Chemainus</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHEMVC-3852838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHEMVC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV3-PH81-JDH1-C3HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459601</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chemainus Valley Courier</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Six bulldozers and 50 firefighters defended the hamlet's southern limits Saturday as water bombers hammered back the flames enough for the evacuation order to be lifted later in the afternoon.</p><p>\"The fire has been contained to a safe perimeter,'' said Susan Mcmanus, a spokeswoman for Alberta Sustainable Resource Development. \"Residents are not at immediate risk.''</p><p>She was hopeful those residents who opted to return would get a more restful sleep Saturday night because the winds that had been fueling the fire Friday night had died down to 5 km/h and some rain had fallen.</p><p>\"The fire is generally quiet,'' she said. \"We did have scattered brief showers over the fire that were quite helpful.''</p><p>A fireguard has been established around the perimeter of the town and a municipal fire truck waited on standby to protect the buildings in the community.

''They're definitely going to be working as hard as they can.''</p><p>Three houses were incinerated.</p><p>Forestry crews were using six helicopters and eight water bombers to attack the fire from the air, but the aircraft were forced to suspend operations due to darkness, Riedlinger said.</p><p>There were 45 provincial firefighters on the ground, backed by the resources of local fire departments in the Kelowna-area. The fire was about two square kilometres before midnight.</p><p>''The wind is so bad, you know,'' said Bettyann Barton. You just don't know where it's going to go.''</p><p>''Very scary, very scary.''</p><p>She said everyone is holding their breath in hopes the devastating fires of 2003 don't repeat themselves.</p><p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day represents the west Kelowna constituency where the fire is raging and he was getting briefings from emergency crews on Saturday.</p><p>Day said the highway leading out of the area was jammed with people taking pictures and trying to leave.</p><p>Hotels in Kelowna and the surrounding area were fully booked.</p><p>The large Gorman Brothers sawmill, with stacks of stored lumber, is also threatened and the local Holiday Inn has been evacuated.</p><p>''I can see the flames, and the winds are very strong,'' Day said. ''The sun was blotted out for quite a while earlier in the afternoon. It was just a red ball.''</p><p>Day said there was a wisp of smoke at 3 p.m. and within 20 minutes, the fire was spreading rapidly.</p><p>''The helicopters and bomber crews responded in an incredibly fast time but the winds are so strong it's pushing this fire along. It's jumped the highway and caused another neighbourhood to be evacuated.''</p><p>Joe Ryan lives across Okanagan Lake from the fire scene, and he said ash was falling onto his deck and the air was choked with smoke.</p><p>Ryan said his family was coming home from a vacation in the Vancouver area when his daughter saw the fire.</p><p>''My daughter yelled out, 'Daddy, Daddy, there's smoke,' and I could see flames.''</p><p>It's unclear how the fire started Saturday afternoon near the residential subdivision of Glenrosa in the B.C. Interior city.</p><p>''We've been expecting this, but there's been no lightening so we don't know what started this,'' Barton said.</p><p>''Probably humans. We've had no storms, no lightening. What else could it be?''</p><p>B.C.'s Okanagan region, with its dry climate, is no stranger to forest fires and Kelowna has felt their wrath before.</p><p>In 2003, lightening strikes triggered a fire that scorched 250 square kilometres, destroyed more than 200 homes and caused millions of dollars in property damage.</p><p>An evacuation order affected up to 45,000 people and it took two weeks for firefighters to conquer what was the most costly fire the area has ever seen.</p><p>''For all of us who lived through the last one, this is just a very sick feeling of deja vu in the pits of our stomachs,'' Day said.</p><p>''This one, from its beginning, has moved much faster than the one in 2003.''</p><p>Ryan said his home was evacuated during the 2003 fires.</p><p>''Having gone through it, it's just a very, very surreal feeling and your heart just goes out to these people.''</p><p>Kelowna resident Merl Fichtner said his father is one of the many people who must leave the area.</p><p>''He's pretty shook up,'' Fichtner said.</p><p>''He was looking immediately west and he could see and hear houses exploding on the hillside.''</p><p>Although only a small percentage of the 4,000 homes under evacuation were directly threatened by the fire, memories of the 2003 blaze prompted officials to take every precaution, Jones said.</p><p>''It is such an unpredictable fire at this point that we're not taking any chances,'' she said.</p><p>''Anyone who was in 2003, it's a very familiar sight.''</p><p>An arena about 10 kilometres away has been converted into a reception centre for those affected by the evacuation.</p><p>There was no way to predict how long people will be away from their homes, Jones said.</p><p>''A few people will be sleeping on a gym floor (Saturday night).''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090719CPCPG9308</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W65-52M1-2R6R-524Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 19, 2009 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(TSX:LSG)(NYSE MKT:LSG)(NYSEAmex:LSG) (\"Lake Shore Gold\" or the \"Company\") today announced that as a result of high winds and smoke from a forest fire approximately 15 kilometres southwest of the Timmins West Mine, operations at the mine have been temporarily suspended. The Company also announced that it has suspended all surface exploration work. Production from the Company's milling facility and mining operations at the Bell Creek Mine, both located on the east side of Timmins, are not affected by the forest fire. The Company currently has a stockpile of 16,000 tonnes of ore available for processing at the mill, representing approximately eight days of production, with another 6,000 tonnes of ore on surface at the Timmins West Mine and 35,000 tonnes of low-grade material also stockpiled at the mill. </p><p>    Tony Makuch, President and CEO of Lake Shore Gold, commented: \"Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people and with the temporary suspension of operations at Timmins West Mine we have taken the steps necessary to ensure that no one is at risk. In terms of production, with the large stockpile we have at the mill we expect there to be no impact on our processing activities. Our production guidance for the second quarter and full year 2012 remain unchanged. We are very pleased with the level of professionalism and cooperation we are receiving from the Ontario Provincial Police, City of Timmins and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and believe that everything is being done to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible.\" </p><p>    About Lake Shore Gold </p><p>Lake Shore Gold is a gold mining company that is in production and pursuing rapid growth through the successful exploration, development and operation of three wholly owned, multi-million ounce gold complexes in the Timmins Gold Camp. The Company is in commercial production at both the Timmins West and Bell Creek mines, with material being delivered for processing to the Bell Creek Mill. A 50% mill expansion, to 3,000 tonnes per day is progressing and is targeted for completion by late 2012. The Company continues to have an active drilling program aimed at supporting current operations and evaluating high-priority exploration targets around the Timmins Camp.

Another person was fatally struck by an object blown over by the high winds fanning the flames.</p><p>The Ministry of the Interior and Safety said fires in in the county of Goseong and nearby coastal city of Sokcho were fully extinguished. Strong winds also carried the blaze to the towns of Gangneung and Inje, but the ministry said fires in those areas were 70 to 80% extinguished.</p><p>The fire likely started Thursday night from a transformer spark near a resort in Goseong and then spread to the mountains, according to Choi Jin-ho, a fire captain at Gangwon Fire Headquarters. Gangwon province governs the Olympic host city of Pyeongchang and is about 210 kilometres (130 miles) northeast of Seoul.</p><p>Videos posted to social media in South Korea showed tall flames rising from large areas of forest, the air filled with embers and debris as cars drove by the raging fire. News photos showed a burnt-out bus, fire engulfing a hill, and residents evacuating apartment complexes and filing into gyms.</p><p>The region is close to the border with North Korea. South Korea's Unification Ministry said Friday it plans to inform North Korea of details about the forest fires.</p><p>The ministry said 135 homes and more than 100 other buildings were burned. About 525 hectares (2 square miles) of forest was estimated to have been destroyed.</p><p>About 60 helicopters, 300 vehicles and 17,700 firefighting personnel were being deployed, the ministry said. The fire also caused blackouts in Goseong, disruptions in telecommunications and internet services, a temporary shutdown of a highway, and delays in train services from Gangneung to Seoul.</p><p>Authorities said a 60-year-old man died because of the fire, and a woman in her 70s died after being hit by wide-angle mirror on a road that fell because of strong winds. Eleven people were treated for injuries. The government didn't comment on the nature of the injuries or how many were serious.</p><p>The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he called for all available resources to be deployed.</p><p>The fire hasn't threatened the Olympic sports facilities, including the main venues in Pyeongchang, the alpine centre in Jeongseon, and the skating centres in seaside Gangneung.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0a7e0c1c20354451aec018f0870429b8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTH-V8F1-DY9S-T0RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"438\"/><timeReceived>04:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, it is recommended that no burning should occur. Forest fuels are very dry and the fire risk is serious. New fires may start easily, burn vigorously, and challenge fire suppression efforts. Extreme caution must be used in any forest activities.</p><p>Gravenhurst Fire Department also reminds anyone in the Muskoka area that they will receive a bill if they are burning in contravention of bylaws and their fire gets out of control.</p><p>A couple of people were in 2day to complain about the bill they received from us.

For more information, check the bylaws for your municipality: Bracebridge, Gravenhurst, Huntsville, Muskoka Lakes, Lake of Bays, Georgian Bay.</p><p>The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the Forest Fire Danger Rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018061246415581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJS-13R1-JDH3-G103-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"372\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Above them the house was burned to the ground.''</p><p>A little further down the road there's a beautiful gazebo sitting on the side of one property and a garage with a shiny new truck and a street hockey net undamaged on the other.</p><p>In between there's nothing more than a pile of charred rubble, all that's left of the house that musician and recording artist Brett Ryan and his family fled on Thursday afternoon, just as flames were reaching their back porch.</p><p>Ryan said although they've lost almost everything the fire has helped he and his wife Lara understand what's important.</p><p>''This is all just stuff. We don't need it. In the end the most important thing is our family. It sounds hokey but in the end it rings pretty true.''</p><p>Ryan lost a couple of antique cars that he and his father were working on and many of his guitars.</p><p>But the one that matters most, a 1956 Gibson Jumbo that he got from his Dad, was spared.</p><p>''Lennie Gallant is doing a record at our studio right now and he asked if he could borrow it so I said 'Sure, no problem.'''</p><p>Ryan and his family have moved into his parents' home until they figure out what the future holds.</p><p>For now he said it's a matter of making sure that life is as normal as possible for his three children.</p><p>''My son loves hockey and we're heading out to one of his spring league games this afternoon,'' he said.</p><p>His son's hockey gear, a wedding ring and family photos were all he was able to grab before fleeing the house.</p><p>In all, the fire destroyed eight homes and damaged several others to varying degrees after it grew from a small brush fire to an inferno stretching over hundreds of hectares and fanned by strong winds late Thursday.</p><p>The more than 100 firefighters and five helicopters enlisted to battle the blaze were pulled out Friday afternoon as light rain became a deluge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090502CPCPG9525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VKR-D890-Y9NS-W4SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 2, 2009 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0009VC1</classCode><className>STRINGED INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0009VC1</classCode><className>STRINGED INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GX059</classCode><className>HALIFAX, NS, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS173</classCode><className>NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As many as 500 people have been forced<br/>from their homes overnight as a wall of flames advances on a<br/>heavily populated subdivision. Firefighters are scrambling to<br/>contain the fire, but shifting winds and tinder dry conditions are<br/>fuelling the danger. CTV's Tom Walters has the latest.</p><p>TOM WALTERS [Reporter]: Summer begins with a fire in the forest.<br/>A five kilometer wall of flame in the woods near Halifax.  Greg<br/>Richardson and Ron Falkehnam watch as it creeps toward their<br/>street.</p><p>RON FALKENHAM [Resident]: It's close to home.</p><p>WALTERS: Where is your house.</p><p>FALKENHAM: Just down the hill here.</p><p>GREG RICHARDSON [Resident]: It's moving pretty quickly right now.</p><p>WALTERS: Have you been asked to leave?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Yeah. We're just packed up here and we're just about<br/>ready to leave.</p><p>WALTERS: And then it's time. In this neighbourhood people take<br/>just what is most precious and head out leaving empty streets and<br/>empty driveways and empty homes in the shadow of the blaze. In the<br/>smoky haze that hangs over nearby lakes, helicopters pick up<br/>buckets of water to drop on the fire. The battle from the air<br/>matched by the work of ,2500 firefighters on the ground. And they<br/>are making a dent.</p><p>TERRY BOURGEOIS [Halifax Fire Department]: It's getting smaller.<br/>but it's kind of looped around on itself a couple of times.</p><p>WALTERS: As the day ends, the fire has been pressed back enough<br/>that authorities can let some people return to their homes. They<br/>must make plans for the others.</p><p>JOHN O'BRIEN [Halifax City Official]: Well we're looking for a<br/>center that will accommodate over 500 people.</p><p>WALTERS: And as a few gather in emergency shelters, many more<br/>will follow for a long and worry filled night away from their<br/>homes.
