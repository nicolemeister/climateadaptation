Attributable royalty revenue(1) of $16.6 million ($0.36 per share(1)) compares to $21.8 million in Q2 2024 and to $17.8 million ($0.38 per share) reported in Q3 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Revenue in the current quarter reflects lower potash prices and seasonal mine maintenance activities, lower dividends from Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp. Post this</p><p>Brian Dalton, CEO commented, \"Revenue in the current quarter reflects lower potash prices and seasonal mine maintenance activities, lower dividends from Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp. (\"LIORC\") on forest fire related disruptions and slightly weaker pricing, and the closure of the Genesee Mine. This was partially offset by higher base metal prices and continuing ramp up of the renewable royalty portfolio. The potash market has returned to its long-term demand growth trendline following a period of price shocks and affordability challenges for farmers. There is continued growth in the renewables segment as new royalty projects commission and incremental investments are completed. In base and battery metals, Chapada (copper) is expected to deliver a strong finish to the year, Voisey's Bay (nickel, copper, cobalt) is approaching completion of its underground conversion, Grota do Cirillo (lithium) has commenced its stage 2 expansion project and Tres Quebradas (lithium) nears construction completion. Several other pre-production royalty projects are seeing positive progress that indicate strong portfolio value growth potential. These include the commencement of early construction works at Curipamba (copper-gold), continuing resource expansion at the Sauva discovery (copper), resource expansion and development study progress at Silicon (gold), permitting and partnering activity advancement at Kami (DR quality iron ore) and further exploration success at Voisey's Bay\".</p><p>Operating Royalty Portfolio Performance //st Summary of attributable royalty revenue Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2023 Base and battery metals $ 5,437 $ 5,474 $ 4,231 Potash 3,585 4,755 3,869 Renewable energy 3,449 2,100 2,648 Iron ore# 2,618 4,114 3,553 Thermal (electrical) coal 2,000 Interest and other 1,509 5,319 1,507 Attributable royalty revenue $ 16,598 $ 21,762 $ 17,808 (#) Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corporation dividends</p><p>Quarterly Highlights //st * On September 12, 2024 the Corporation announced that ARR (58% owned by the Corporation) had entered into a definitive arrangement agreement with an affiliate of Northampton Capital Partners, LLC (Northampton) whereby Northampton will, subject to customary closing conditions, acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of ARR other than those indirectly owned by Altius by way of a statutory plan of arrangement for cash consideration of $12.00 per share representing total consideration of approximately $162 million. The Corporation holds 17,937,339 common shares in ARR as of September 30, 2024. After the close of the transaction, which is expected in late November, the Corporation will continue to hold 17,937,339 shares or approximately 57% of the total shares outstanding, along with 3,093,835 share purchase warrants in ARR. * On July 31, 2024 Adventus Mining Corporation (\"Adventus\"), owners of the El Domo Curipamba project, closed an all share transaction whereby Silvercorp Metals Inc. (\"Silvercorp\") acquired the common shares of Adventus under a plan of arrangement. Under the terms of the arrangement, each former shareholder of Adventus, other than Silvercorp, received 0.1015 of one Silvercorp common share for each Adventus Share. Altius holds a 2% net smelter return (\"NSR\") royalty on the project. On August 6, 2024 Silvercorp announced that Curipamba had received its final exploitation permit to enter construction and on August 21, 2024 announced the initiation of the construction process with a goal of first production in 2026. Average annual production in the first nine years (see Feasibility Study dated Dec 2021) is expected to be approximately 11,000 tonnes of copper and 26,000 ounces of gold, along with associated zinc, silver and lead. * AngloGold Ashanti plc (AGA) continues to advance the discovery of a potential major new gold district centered around its Silicon Project near Beatty, Nevada. AGA recently provided an update for the \"Expanded Silicon Project\", which includes both the Silicon and Merlin gold deposits, that was highlighted by the announcement of an initial Inferred Mineral Resource of 9.05 million ounces at the Merlin deposit (283.9 Mt at 0.99 g/t). Altius holds a 1.5% NSR royalty related to the project. Recently reported results from an ongoing delineation drilling program at Merlin included intercepts of 144.5m grading 10.53 g/t gold and 190.4m grading 5.12 g/t gold, all within oxide material. The Corporation continues to await a decision from an arbitration proceeding held in April of this year to determine the full extent of lands that are subject to its royalty. * Champion Iron Limited (\"Champion\") commenced the environmental review and permitting process for the Kami project and expects this to run until early 2026. Efforts to secure a steel making partner for the project also continued to advance. High purity iron ore was added to the Canadian critical minerals list in June 2024 with this designation expected to open up more low cost financing opportunities and other benefits related to critical minerals infrastructure. Champion reported their most recent results dated October 20 2024 and reiterated their view that the long term demand for this type of high purity feed will continue to accelerate. Altius originated the Kami project and retains a 3% gross sales royalty interest.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $10.5 million ($0.23 per share(1)) during Q3 2024 compares to $12.5 million ($0.26 per share) during Q3 2023 and follows the trend of revenue.</p><p>Q3 2024 adjusted operating cash flow(1) of $10.9 million ($0.23 per share(1)) compares to $11.0 million ($0.23 per share) in Q3 2023. The timing of interest, corporate tax payments and refunds positively impacted adjusted operating cash flow during the current quarter.</p><p>Net earnings of $3.2 million ($0.06 per share) for Q3 2024 compares to net earnings of $3.5 million ($0.08 per share) in Q3 2023 reflecting lower revenues as well as lower amortization offset by marginally higher costs. Adjusted net earnings per share(1) of $0.05 for the current quarter is comparable to the third quarter of 2023. The main adjusting items are summarized in the below table. //st Adjusted Net Earnings Three months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Net earnings attributable to common shareholders $ 2,852 $ 3,703 Addback (deduct): Unrealized loss on fair value adjustment of derivatives (198 ) (1,471 ) Foreign exchange (gain) loss (510 ) 460 Exploration and evaluation assets abandoned or impaired 65 Realized gain on disposal of derivatives 206 Gain on disposal of mineral property (276 ) Tax impact 138 166 Adjusted Net Earnings $ 2,553 $ 2,582</p><p>Liquidity and Capital Allocation Summary</p><p>Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were $109.6 million, compared to $130.4 million at the end of 2023.

There were no shares repurchased and cancelled under the Corporation's Normal Course Issuer Bid during the quarter. The Corporation renewed its Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\") during the third quarter, which commenced August 22, 2024 and will end no later than August 21, 2025.</p><p>At September 30, 2024 the Corporation carried a balance of $98.7 million under its term debt facilities and $9.0 million under its revolving credit facility. On August 30, 2024, the Corporation amended its credit facility to extend the term from August 2025 to August 2028 and replace the combination of its previously outstanding term and revolver debt. The total available credit of $225,000,000 and its principal repayments are consistent with its previous credit facility and the Corporation did not draw any additional amounts during the period. The amended credit facility consists of a $50,000,000 term credit facility, a US$36,000,000 term credit facility and a $125,000,000 revolving credit facility.</p><p>Dividend Declaration</p><p>The Corporations board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share. The current quarterly dividend is payable to all shareholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2024. The dividend is expected to be paid on or about December 16, 2024.</p><p>This dividend is eligible for payment in common shares under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) announced by press release May 20, 2020, and available to shareholders who are Canadian residents or residents of countries outside the United States.</p><p>In order to be eligible to participate in respect of the December 16, 2024 dividend, non-registered shareholders must provide instruction to their brokerage and registered shareholders must provide completed enrollment forms to the transfer agent by November 22, 2024, five business days prior to record date. Stock market purchases made under the DRIP for the December 16, 2024 payment will be satisfied by issuance from treasury at the 5 day volume weighted average price ending at the close of trading the day before payment date. Shareholders who have already provided instruction to be enrolled previously will continue to be enrolled unless they direct otherwise. For more information, please see Altius Minerals Corporation Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Participation in the DRIP is optional and will not impact any cash dividends payable to shareholders who do not elect to participate in the DRIP. The declaration, timing and payment of future dividends will largely depend on the Corporations financial results as well as other factors. Dividends paid by Altius on its common shares are eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Non GAAP Financial Measures //st 1. Management uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: attributable revenue, attributable royalty revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted net earnings (loss). Management uses these measures to monitor the financial performance of the Corporation and its operating segments and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporations financial performance with its competitors and/or evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures are intended to provide additional information, not to replace International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) measures, and do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

This strategy further provides shareholders with exposures that are well aligned with sustainability-related global growth trends including the electricity generation transition from fossil fuel to renewables, transportation electrification, reduced emissions from steelmaking and increasing agricultural yield requirements. These macro-trends each hold the potential to cause increased demand for many of Altiuss commodity exposures including copper, renewable based electricity, several key battery metals (lithium, nickel and cobalt), clean iron ore, and potash. In addition, Altius runs a successful Project Generation business that originates mineral projects for sale to developers in exchange for equity positions and royalties. Altius has 46,479,865 common shares issued and outstanding that are listed on Canadas Toronto Stock Exchange. It is included in each of the S&amp;P/TSX Small Cap, the S&amp;P/TSX Global Mining, and the S&amp;P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats indices.</p><p>Forward-looking information</p><p>This news release contains forward-looking information.

Edgell informed local authorities \u2013 such as Thompson-Nicola Regional District Director Lee Onslow \u2013 of the planned outage at 3:28 p.m, about three and a half hours before the scheduled 7:00 p.m. outage. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Repairing the pole was urgent, Edgell told The Goat in an email.  </p><p>\u201cIf we left the power on and left the faulty equipment as it was [on Wednesday], we could have seen the broken infrastructure on the pole collapse, taking down the high voltage live powerline with it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf this had happened, we could have started a major forest fire.\u201d </p><p>Edgell said she was told there was not enough time to send a planned outage notification to customers, so she prioritized alerting regional district directors and other local authorities. </p><p>In her initial email, Edgell sent an estimated outage time of six hours. Before arriving at the repair site, crews thought the site would be easily accessible, according to Edgell, but once they got there, they realized a road would have to be constructed to reach the pole. This work would be dangerous to do in the dark, meaning crews had to wait until the following morning to construct a road with bulldozers and then repair the pole. </p><p>Power was restored around 3:21 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, a full day after residents were notified of the outage. Hydro sent several predictions of how long the outage would last: after the initial 6-hour estimate, the company said it would be restored at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday at the earliest \u2013 about 14 hours after the outage began \u2013 then pushed this estimate back to 3:30 p.m. Some residents felt frustrated at the lack of direct communication and initial incorrect estimate of the outage length. </p><p>\u201cThey never did directly contact anybody \u2013 I\u2019d seen it blasted across Facebook, that\u2019s how come I knew the power was going out,\u201d said Micky Humphrey, who rents cabins on her property just outside of Blue River. \u201cIt was going to be out for six hours... They get [to the job site], they realize they can\u2019t access it, but they already shut the damn power off.\u201d </p><p>Humphrey appreciates that the crew needed daylight to do their jobs safely, but wishes Hydro hadn\u2019t sent premature estimates of when power would be restored, she said. This outage was one of many this summer, at a time where her business has already been hit by dwindling tourism in the area, Humphrey said. </p><p>In an email to The Goat, Edgell said Blue River had three outages earlier this summer, all lasting under five hours and all due to lightning strikes. </p><p>Lee Onslow, one of the regional district directors who Hydro informed of the outage, said it was unusual for the company not to contact customers directly \u2013 in her experience, Hydro typically sends an email notification before planned outages. </p><p>\u201cIt seemed to me, especially at the beginning of the power outage and the short notice, that it probably would have been useful for individuals in these communities\u2026 to actually hear directly from BC Hydro, because a lot of the information was coming from Facebook,\u201d Onslow told The Goat in an interview. </p><p>\u201cI commend the BC Hydro workers for fixing this problem, but I also find it a bit frustrating when you\u2019re told the power outage will be six hours and then you\u2019re not notified until the morning that the power is still not on and it\u2019s going to take all day,\u201d she added. \u201cI would have really appreciated BC Hydro knowing more about what the job looked like prior to saying that it was going to be a short outage.\u201d </p><p>In an email statement to The Goat, Interior Health\u2019s Executive Director of Clinical Operations in Cariboo/South Cariboo Karen Cooper said the Dr. Helmcken Memorial Hospital in Clearwater was operational during the outage, largely due to the hospital\u2019s gas-powered generator. </p><p>\u201cThe hospital also didn\u2019t experience any water shortages and we have since made updates to the building\u2019s water connection which will give us easier access to alternative water sources should something similar happen in the future,\u201d Cooper added. \u201cWe were in close communication with the District of Clearwater, BC Hydro and other partners during the power outage.\u201d </p><p>McBride was unaffected by the outage, despite being on the same part of the transmission system as Blue River and Clearwater. Valemount had an outage for about an hour. Both McBride and Valemount were \u201cislanded,\u201d a process where communities are moved to an Independent Power Producer\u2019s transmission system, according to Edgell. </p><p>Onslow said she asked Hydro if the company could enter an agreement with an Independent Power Producer in Bone Creek. Edgell told The Goat that the company does not currently have an agreement with the Bone Creek producer, and could not confirm whether such an agreement is being considered by the company at this time. </p><p>Onslow and other directors have also asked Hydro if the transmission system could be extended to Prince George, which would provide a backup energy source for the Robson Valley. Edgell says this won\u2019t be a possibility for at least the next 10 years. </p><p>\u201cCreating a loop from Prince George to Valemount has been looked at in the past, and that would be about a 275 km long extension on the transmission system,\u201d Edgell told The Goat. \u201cBased on the current level of reliability and capacity, BC Hydro cannot justify including a second transmission supply to the area.\u201d </p><p>Edgell acknowledged that the window of time between her first email and the power outage was short, but emphasized that the repairs were necessary. </p><p>\u201cCrews worked as quickly and diligently as they could to gain access to the site,\u201d Edgell said. \u201cWe want to thank all our customers for their patience and for having to endure the inconveniences this outage has caused.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ef126c12353142f8b0ae3b8984045007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CVW-B7S1-JBVR-30V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1004\"/><timeReceived>02:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 31, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Principal Ellen Zelikovitz believes the damage was done with an axe. </p><p>\u201cThey also took an axe to one of the trees in front of the school and completely cut it down,\u201d she said. \u201cThey smashed the window out of our little free library box.\u201d </p><p>Zelikovitz said the damage is primarily affecting Whistler\u2019s youngest citizens. </p><p>\u201cWe are unsure of who is doing this, but it\u2019s extremely upsetting for the kids having their play areas destroyed. Even the high-school students are upset as they built all of those items for the younger kids in our community.\u201d. </p><p>Owner/operator of Adventure Man Sawmill and Lumber Dan Muill offered to supply wood for free for repairs on the playhouse. He told Pique his decision to help in any  way he could was a no-brainer. \u201cI just feel the damage was completely uncalled for. Its design was to bring joy to kids and yet some person felt the need to rampage on a structure for whatever reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the capabilities to provide lumber and tools. I\u2019m just happy to help the cause.\u201d </p><p>Another playhouse in the area was smashed up the previous weekend. Local man Dale Tiessen spotted the damage on his way into the park at 9 a.m. on Sunday, April 28. Tiessen posted to the Whistler Winter Facebook group in frustration.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve smashed up bird houses, tried to burn things and you\u2019ve left broken glass in a children\u2019s playhouse,\u201d he wrote. </p><p>Tiessen told Pique he was disgusted by the damage. \u201cI saw that the shingles had been pulled off the roof. They had tried to set them on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some other stuff that was broken. I looked inside the playhouse and I also saw broken glass. It\u2019s just not good for little kids.\u201d </p><p>Tiessen was surprised by the impact his Facebook post had. Members of the community worked together to fix the beloved playhouse for local children. </p><p>Tiessen added arson can have dire consequences during the summer. \u201cIt is that time of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at the edge of the forest and it\u2019s dry. Nobody wants to start a forest fire.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2d3e49ed14fc491ba2d04a9346fc043f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2X-B861-DY9S-T1T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><timeReceived>04:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 20, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As of Thursday afternoon, the flames were about six kilometres away from the town, kept at bay by favourable wind conditions and a river, fire officials said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The risk is if it jumps the river, and the biggest driver of whether it'll jump the river or not is the wind patterns,\" Premier Andrew Furey said. \"Right now, there's a favourable wind pattern, but we live in Newfoundland and Labrador, winds change all the time.\"</p><p>Blair Adams, with the province's Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture Department, concurred. \"The rain helped us out this morning, but it was relatively short-lived, and we're certainly concerned about the rest of the day.\"</p><p>An emergency order to evacuate Churchill Falls was texted and emailed to residents at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, asking them to pack up and leave within 45 minutes. The town is home to about 700 people, most of whom work at the local hydroelectric generating station, which supplies power to Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>Robert Dawe was among those who fled, and he said cars and trucks were bumper to bumper along the remote, two-lane Trans-Labrador Highway as people made their way east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Lightning cracked the sky as the vehicles left behind a spiralling cloud of smoke and drove toward torrential rains falling in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>\"I wasn't surprised because I know the fire was close,\" Dawe said about the call to evacuate. \"But the wind was blowing it closer to town and it flared up. It was under control, but it got worse really fast.\"</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the province's wildfire dashboard showed the blaze encompassed about seven square kilometres. As of Thursday afternoon, it had more than doubled in size, to 16 square kilometres, officials said.</p><p>Four water bombers, a number of helicopters and 40 fire fighters were all working to douse the flames. Furey said he asked for help from other provinces through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In the meantime, with all of the province's firefighting resources working in Labrador, he announced a ban on all outdoor fires across the island of Newfoundland and throughout the southern and central region of Labrador.</p><p>Jennifer Williams, chief executive of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, said a small crew was still on site at the generating station and production levels were normal. There are plans in place to evacuate those workers if needed, she added.</p><p>Perry Trimper, the Liberal member of the provincial legislature for the region, said earlier Thursday that more than 500 evacuees had checked in with officials in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Some were given beds at the YMCA, but most had friends and family they were staying with. He said teams of volunteers loaded mattresses into the YMCA Wednesday night for people fleeing Churchill Falls. Businesses stayed open late to feed them, and residents from all over the community showed up at the YMCA to help out. And it all happened in the midst of a raging thunder and rainstorm, he said.</p><p>There were seven active wildfires in Labrador on Thursday. Four, in the central region, were burning out of control. The remaining three, in the western region, were listed on the provincial wildfire dashboard as \"being held,\" meaning they were no longer spreading.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2024062171872911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9H-HPR1-F197-502F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 21, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002VXC</classCode><className>NEWFOUNDLAND &amp;

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

As of Thursday afternoon, the flames were about six kilometres away from the town, kept at bay by favourable wind conditions and a river, fire officials said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The risk is if it jumps the river, and the biggest driver of whether it'll jump the river or not is the wind patterns,\" Premier Andrew Furey said. \"Right now, there's a favourable wind pattern, but we live in Newfoundland and Labrador, winds change all the time.\"</p><p>Blair Adams, with the province's Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture Department, concurred. \"The rain helped us out this morning, but it was relatively short-lived, and we're certainly concerned about the rest of the day.\"</p><p>An emergency order to evacuate Churchill Falls was texted and emailed to residents at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, asking them to pack up and leave within 45 minutes. The town is home to about 700 people, most of whom work at the local hydroelectric generating station, which supplies power to Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>Robert Dawe was among those who fled, and he said cars and trucks were bumper to bumper along the remote, two-lane Trans-Labrador Highway as people made their way east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Lightning cracked the sky as the vehicles left behind a spiralling cloud of smoke and drove toward torrential rains falling in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>\"I wasn't surprised because I know the fire was close,\" Dawe said about the call to evacuate. \"But the wind was blowing it closer to town and it flared up. It was under control, but it got worse really fast.\"</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the province's wildfire dashboard showed the blaze encompassed about seven square kilometres. As of Thursday afternoon, it had more than doubled in size, to 16 square kilometres, officials said.</p><p>Four water bombers, a number of helicopters and 40 fire fighters were all working to douse the flames. Furey said he asked for help from other provinces through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In the meantime, with all of the province's firefighting resources working in Labrador, he announced a ban on all outdoor fires across the island of Newfoundland and throughout the southern and central region of Labrador.</p><p>Jennifer Williams, chief executive of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, said a small crew was still on site at the generating station and production levels were normal. There are plans in place to evacuate those workers if needed, she added.</p><p>Perry Trimper, the Liberal member of the provincial legislature for the region, said earlier Thursday that more than 500 evacuees had checked in with officials in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Some were given beds at the YMCA, but most had friends and family they were staying with. He said teams of volunteers loaded mattresses into the YMCA Wednesday night for people fleeing Churchill Falls. Businesses stayed open late to feed them, and residents from all over the community showed up at the YMCA to help out. And it all happened in the midst of a raging thunder and rainstorm, he said.</p><p>There were seven active wildfires in Labrador on Thursday. Four, in the central region, were burning out of control. The remaining three, in the western region, were listed on the provincial wildfire dashboard as \"being held,\" meaning they were no longer spreading.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024062171874056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9H-HPR1-F197-50KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

As of Thursday afternoon, the flames were about six kilometres away from the town, kept at bay by favourable wind conditions and a river, fire officials said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The risk is if it jumps the river, and the biggest driver of whether it'll jump the river or not is the wind patterns,\" Premier Andrew Furey said. \"Right now, there's a favourable wind pattern, but we live in Newfoundland and Labrador, winds change all the time.\"</p><p>Blair Adams, with the province's Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture Department, concurred. \"The rain helped us out this morning, but it was relatively short-lived, and we're certainly concerned about the rest of the day.\"</p><p>An emergency order to evacuate Churchill Falls was texted and emailed to residents at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, asking them to pack up and leave within 45 minutes. The town is home to about 700 people, most of whom work at the local hydroelectric generating station, which supplies power to Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>Robert Dawe was among those who fled, and he said cars and trucks were bumper to bumper along the remote, two-lane Trans-Labrador Highway as people made their way east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Lightning cracked the sky as the vehicles left behind a spiralling cloud of smoke and drove toward torrential rains falling in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>\"I wasn't surprised because I know the fire was close,\" Dawe said about the call to evacuate. \"But the wind was blowing it closer to town and it flared up. It was under control, but it got worse really fast.\"</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the province's wildfire dashboard showed the blaze encompassed about seven square kilometres. As of Thursday afternoon, it had more than doubled in size, to 16 square kilometres, officials said.</p><p>Four water bombers, a number of helicopters and 40 fire fighters were all working to douse the flames. Furey said he asked for help from other provinces through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In the meantime, with all of the province's firefighting resources working in Labrador, he announced a ban on all outdoor fires across the island of Newfoundland and throughout the southern and central region of Labrador.</p><p>Jennifer Williams, chief executive of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, said a small crew was still on site at the generating station and production levels were normal. There are plans in place to evacuate those workers if needed, she added.</p><p>Perry Trimper, the Liberal member of the provincial legislature for the region, said earlier Thursday that more than 500 evacuees had checked in with officials in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Some were given beds at the YMCA, but most had friends and family they were staying with. He said teams of volunteers loaded mattresses into the YMCA Wednesday night for people fleeing Churchill Falls. Businesses stayed open late to feed them, and residents from all over the community showed up at the YMCA to help out. And it all happened in the midst of a raging thunder and rainstorm, he said.</p><p>There were seven active wildfires in Labrador on Thursday. Four, in the central region, were burning out of control. The remaining three, in the western region, were listed on the provincial wildfire dashboard as \"being held,\" meaning they were no longer spreading.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2024062171873243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9H-HPR1-F197-50GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Most of those were in Alberta, which saw unusually warm weather in late April and early May of last year, with almost no rain.</p><p>By that date Alberta was already asking for help to fight fires, and 25,000 people had been forced to flee their homes. Almost 6,000 square kilometres had already burned.</p><p>That extreme start led to the worst fire season Canada has seen by far, with 6,600 fires burning more than 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area greater than all of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined.</p><p>Julienne Morissette, the director of wildland fire research for Natural Resources Canada, said Alberta's spring has been a bit cooler, with more precipitation than last year.</p><p>\"While it looks more positive we are still under the effects of significant drought so as temperatures warm things can dry very quickly,\" she said.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada said about one-third of the fires burning now are so-called zombie fires that started last year, went underground for the winter and re-emerged after the snow melted.</p><p>Just over 176 square kilometres have burned so far, said Morissette, well below the 25-year average of 510 square kilometres.</p><p>Of the current fires, 40 are burning in Alberta, 24 in British Columbia and 10 in Manitoba. Four fires burning in New Brunswick are the only ones in Atlantic Canada, while Ontario has two and Quebec one.</p><p>The fire forecast for the rest of May and June shows an elevated risk across all of Western Canada except for the west coast of British Columbia. There is very high to extreme risk in much of southern and central Saskatchewan, parts of northern Alberta and the interior of British Columbia.</p><p>Most of Ontario and western Quebec are at moderate risk, while eastern Quebec and Atlantic Canada show low risk.</p><p>READ ALSO: B.C. prepares for wildfires as forecasts call for hot weather amid drought</p><p>READ ALSO: New portal expected to help B.C. evacuees find accommodations faster</p><p>Copyright 2024 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20240509PAB4601411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0D-KMW1-F0HF-8039-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Group Ltd.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

As of Thursday afternoon, the flames were about six kilometres away from the town, kept at bay by favourable wind conditions and a river, fire officials said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The risk is if it jumps the river, and the biggest driver of whether it'll jump the river or not is the wind patterns,\" Premier Andrew Furey said. \"Right now, there's a favourable wind pattern, but we live in Newfoundland and Labrador, winds change all the time.\"</p><p>Blair Adams, with the province's Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture Department, concurred. \"The rain helped us out this morning, but it was relatively short-lived, and we're certainly concerned about the rest of the day.\"</p><p>An emergency order to evacuate Churchill Falls was texted and emailed to residents at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, asking them to pack up and leave within 45 minutes. The town is home to about 700 people, most of whom work at the local hydroelectric generating station, which supplies power to Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>Robert Dawe was among those who fled, and he said cars and trucks were bumper to bumper along the remote, two-lane Trans-Labrador Highway as people made their way east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Lightning cracked the sky as the vehicles left behind a spiralling cloud of smoke and drove toward torrential rains falling in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>\"I wasn't surprised because I know the fire was close,\" Dawe said about the call to evacuate. \"But the wind was blowing it closer to town and it flared up. It was under control, but it got worse really fast.\"</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the province's wildfire dashboard showed the blaze encompassed about seven square kilometres. As of Thursday afternoon, it had more than doubled in size, to 16 square kilometres, officials said.</p><p>Four water bombers, a number of helicopters and 40 fire fighters were all working to douse the flames. Furey said he asked for help from other provinces through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In the meantime, with all of the province's firefighting resources working in Labrador, he announced a ban on all outdoor fires across the island of Newfoundland and throughout the southern and central region of Labrador.</p><p>Jennifer Williams, chief executive of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, said a small crew was still on site at the generating station and production levels were normal. There are plans in place to evacuate those workers if needed, she added.</p><p>Perry Trimper, the Liberal member of the provincial legislature for the region, said earlier Thursday that more than 500 evacuees had checked in with officials in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Some were given beds at the YMCA, but most had friends and family they were staying with. He said teams of volunteers loaded mattresses into the YMCA Wednesday night for people fleeing Churchill Falls. Businesses stayed open late to feed them, and residents from all over the community showed up at the YMCA to help out.

The iconic red-and-white waterbomber d\u00e9part ed from the Sproat Lake Bomber Base,and circled around to fly over Port Alberni\u2019s Harbour Quay. It was scheduled to take a small tour of Vancouver Island\u2019s eastern coastline before it landcd in Patricia Bay in Victoria on Sunday evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt\u2019s the end of an era,\u201d said Uwe Goehl, who grew up in Port Alberni listening to the distinctive roar of the flying tankers\u2019 engines. Goehl, a pilot who now lives in Ontario, was at Sproat Lake to watch the Hawaii Mars\u2019 final flight.</p><p>At Piper\u2019s Lagoon, on Nanaimo\u2019s waterfront, dozens of people \u2014 many with cam\u00e9ras and flight tracking apps on their smartphones \u2014 waited to see the Hawaii Mars fly down the coast for a final time. \u201cI came out here to see the last flight of the Martin Mars and it was awesome,\u201d said Bob Moore.</p><p>Moore was 12 years old when he first saw the Mars waterbombers.</p><p>\u201cFighting the forest fire in Salmon Arm, over Mount Ida. Thcy were both there that year (The Hawaii and Philippine Mars).\u201d</p><p>Moore was also at Sproat Lake with his boat on Aug. 1 and said he lucked out seeing the Hawaii Mars make its first flight in eight years. \u201cIt was fantastic. I didn\u2019t think they were going to fly that day and then they hit the throttle and took to the air.\u201d</p><p>A huge welcoming party was waiting for the Hawaii Mars in Victoria for its final landing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where it first landed, you know, in 1959 or I960,\u201d said Wayne Coulson, CEO of Coulson Aviation on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going back to its resting spot. We just had it here [in Port Alberni] for 64 years.\u201d</p><p>The Hawaii Mars was one of six Martin Mars aircraft originally conceived as military bombers in the United States during the Second World War. It started service in 1945 as a transport aircraft for the United States Navy. After the war, it was purchased by a consortium of timber companies in British Columbia and converted to a waterbomber to protect the timber lands on Vancouver Island.</p><p>In 2006, it was sold \u2014 along with the Philippine Mars \u2014 to Coulson Aviation.</p><p>Although the aircraft hasn\u2019t taken part in firefighting action since 2015, Coulson says it has firmly established itself in British Columbia\u2019s f\u00eeref\u00eeghting history. \u201cThere will never be a better firefighting aircraft, no matter what anybody says,\u201d said Coulson. \u201cThis thing drops four acres [of water] at a time. We\u2019ve seen it do so much good work over the years. That airplane will live on forever through our existing air tanker program,\u201d he added.</p><p>The aircraft was set to arrive in Victoria on Sunday evening, in formation with ail nine planes of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds d\u00e9monstration team. This week, the plane will be dewatered and moved to the B.C. Aviation Mus\u00e9um in North Saanich, where it will be part of the museum\u2019s new B.C. wildfire aviation exhibit.</p><p>The new exhibit is expected to officially open to visitors on Saturday, Sept. 28. Visitors will h\u00e2ve a chance to explore the inside of the aircraft and even sit in the pilot\u2019s chair.</p><p>The bomber\u2019s pilots, Rick Matthews and Peter Killin, will also become a part of history. They both wore specially designed flight suits on Sunday, which will be left behind in Victoria and will become a part of the mus\u00e9um exhibit.</p><p>Matthews and Killin, started together at Harbour Air in 1984, and h\u00e2ve been piloting aircraft on the west coast for more than 50 years. Killin has logged more than 1,000 hours of flying time with the bomber.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s touching, it really is,\u201d said Matthews of the crowd gathered around the lake on Sunday. \u201cWhen we first started this, three or four months ago, I had no idea how it would snowball into this kind of event.\u201d The boats, he added, h\u00e2ve been \u201crespectful and courteous\u201d about sharing the water with the bomber.</p><p>His copilot, Peter Killin, said he was not surprised by the r\u00e9ception \u2014 although he admitted he\u2019s never seen so many boats in the water before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ail lier supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cI know this town, I know the lakers.

Both fires are in the northeast portion of the park, southeast of Lake Travers. As of 8:38 a.m. on Monday, June 5, the fires continued active and \"not under control.\"<br/><br/> By 3:55 p.m. on Monday, June 5, Algonquin Park 6 had grown to 30 hectares, while Algonquin Park 7 stayed at 2.1 hectares, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. Both fires continued to burn \"not in control.\" However, by 8 a.m. on Tuesday, June 6, the fires had been classified as \"being held\" at their current size. At 8 a.m. on Wednesday, June 7, the fires had not grown but were active and \"being held.\" At 8 a.m. on Thursday, June 8, there was no change in the status of the fires, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services interactive map.<br/><br/> By 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, June 8 the larger of the fires, the 30-hectare Algonquin Park 6 is now considered \"under control,\" while Algonquin Park 7 continues \"being held\" at 2.1 hectares.<br/><br/> The fire hazard remains high to extreme across the Northeast Region. The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating and the Almaguin, North Bay Fire Danger Ratings are Extreme with a Total Fire Ban in effect.<br/><br/> RESTRICTED FIRE ZONE<br/><br/> Due to the extreme forest fire hazard, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has declared a Restricted Fire Zone effective Thursday, June 1, at 12:01 a.m. local time for the districts of Hearst/Cochrane/Kapuskasing, Chapleau/Wawa, Timmins/Kirkland Lake, Sault Ste Marie/Blind River, Sudbury, North Bay, Minden/Parry Sound/Bracebridge, Pembroke, a northern portion of the Peterborough/Bancroft District, and the southeastern portion of the Far North District. No open air burning, including campfires, is permitted within the boundaries of a Restricted Fire Zone. Portable gas or propane stoves may be used for cooking and warmth BUT must be handled with extreme caution. All burning permits are suspended. The Restricted Fire Zone is in place until further notice. <br/><br/> To learn more about what is permitted and not permitted in a Restricted Fire Zone, visit Outdoor fire restrictions | ontario.ca<br/><br/> NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE<br/><br/> According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> FOLLOW ONTARIO'S OUTDOOR BURNING REGULATIONS <br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services would like to remind the public to use caution when performing any outdoor burning. In order to dispose of yard waste and woody debris, we encourage you to use methods such as composting or using your local landfill.

The latest was a .1-hectare fire burning on Gander Creek, above Krestova in the southern end of the Slocan Valley. Discovered on Monday, July 10, it\u2019s listed as \u2018out of control\u2019 and is suspected to be lightning caused. </p><p>Two new spot fires were discovered the day before north of Nakusp, on Mount Islip and Mount Leary. The Mount Leary fire was larger, at .6 ha, while the Mount Islip fire was at .1 ha. Both fires were listed as \u2018out of control\u2019 at press time. </p><p>Other fires include the Wee Sandy Creek fire in Valhalla Park, discovered on July 1, but a week later had only spread to .08 ha. Fire officials described it as \u2018being held,\u2019 meaning it is \u201cnot likely to spread beyond predetermined boundaries under current conditions.\u201d Two older fires continue to burn at the far northern end of Duncan Lake. The human-caused Beartrap Creek is the largest at 13 ha, while a fire at Coot Lake is about .13 ha in size. </p><p>No evacuation orders or alerts are currently in place in the southeast region, and none of the fires are threatening homes or infrastructure. </p><p>However, conditions are changing to hotter and dryer, and regular thunderstorms have been moving through the area the last week, bringing the chance of more lightning-caused fires. Forecasters expect sunny, dry and hot conditions for the readership area over the next week or so. </p><p>On Monday, officials extended the campfire ban across the entire province, adding the Southeast Fire Centre, which had previously been exempt. </p><p>The ban prohibits campfires and any larger open fires, grass burning, as well as fireworks, sky lanterns, and explosive targets, among others. Outdoor stoves used for cooking, heat or ambiance that burn charcoal briquettes, liquid fuel, or gaseous fuel (with flames less than 15 cm) are still allowed. </p><p>In the rest of the province, officials issued more than two dozen evacuation orders and alerts for communities in the central, northern and northwest parts of the province on Sunday. Thousands of lightning strikes sparked dozens of new fires over the weekend in the north \u2013 all out of control. More than 300 fires were burning in the province at press time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-bd656b92d2a744138dea08586fecdaa8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PC-FP81-DY9S-T0WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 13, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

During the past three decades, the average number of forest fires has been about 1,000 fires annually, with an average burnt area of 0.5 ha per fire.</p><p>Longtime wildfire ecologist Robert Gray has been telling us for some time we need to make some changes to our forest practices including more thinning and prescribed burns at low fire intensity.</p><p>Some people in the forest industry are also promoting some changes to our harvesting practices.</p><p>Ian Kerr, owner of West Kootenays, B.C.-based AcreShakerr Contracting, thinks it is important to incentivize pre-commercial thinning, first and second pass thinning, and good stewardship.</p><p>An article in Canadian Forest Industry by Ellen Cools describes how Keer has been transitioning to smaller harvesting equipment that causes less damage during his commercial thinning operations.</p><p>His purchase of a F4 Dion forwarder from Michel Dion, based in St. Augustin-de-Martins, Quebec has allowed him to change everything in terms of not having to build any block roads or trails, or construct landings, and being able to have very dense tree retention without any residual damage.</p><p>\u201cThe forwarder on rubber tracks, very small \u2013 six feet wide, 28 feet long \u2013 can haul either cord wood or short logs (16-to 18-foot ) which meet cut-to-length requirements for local sawmills. The forwarder is so small it can move between trees easily. The F4 Dion has a rubber track with an iron cleat, similar to a snowcat, but smoother, with only one point of contact for traction. As a result, it\u2019s very light on the ground and does not squash the root maps in the forest.\u201d</p><p>Locally Ken Day has also been promoting changing our forest practices as described in a CBC article about a fire that started in the Alex Fraser Research Forest on the afternoon of July 7, 2017.</p><p>More forest thinning is needed which involves removing trees and other vegetation that is dead or slow-growing to make room for new trees and to remove wildfire fuel from the area.</p><p>He goes on to compare us with traditional European forestry practices.

Vance and the new Second Lady, wore a sculptural pink dress with built-in scarf by Oscar de la Renta, with Manolo Blahnik boots.

God Bless everyone!\"</p><p>The Great One's friendly relationship with Trump has been under scrutiny in recent weeks. In December, the president-elect told his followers on Truth Social that he had encouraged Gretzky to run for office: \"I said, 'Wayne, why don't you run for prime minister of Canada, soon to be known as the governor of Canada - you would win easily, you wouldn't even have to campaign.'

It's a repeated claim of Trump's that the committee found no evidence of ever happening.</p><p>Trump also claimed Biden pardoned \"33 murderers\" and denounced Cheney as a \"crying lunatic.\"</p><p>Biden commuted the sentences of 37 people facing the death sentence. They must still serve life in prison without parole - they were not \"pardoned\" as Trump implied.</p><p>Earlier Monday, Biden also commuted the life sentence of Native American activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted of murdering two FBI agents. Peltier will serve out the rest of his sentence in home confinement.</p><p>Read the full transcript of Trump's speech.</p><p>1:54 p.m. Sen. John Fetterman keeps it casual</p><p>Trump's official swearing-in ceremony was moved inside the Capitol Rotunda due to forecasts of \"intense cold weather,\" with temperatures dipping below zero around noon. But the chilly air did not seem to bother Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who arrived at the Capitol wearing a baggy pair of shorts and a black Carhartt hoodie.

Vance and the new Second Lady, wore a sculptural pink dress with built-in scarf by Oscar de la Renta, with Manolo Blahnik boots.

He then turned around and repeated the gesture: \"My heart goes out to you,\" he said.</p><p>\"You saw him come out with that odd-looking salute,\" CNN anchor Erin Burnett noted during the broadcast.</p><p>The ensuing fervour on social media was more blunt: \"Yes, that is very clearly a Nazi salute,\" one X user wrote.</p><p>But not everyone saw it that way.

Sitting low on her face Spy vs. Spy-style, the hat is destined to become an instant meme, while preventing the cameras from catching any accidental facial expressions - Melania has been captured seemingly giving side-eye at events in the past.</p><p>The choice of Adam Lippes for her outfit seems calculated to show support for a smaller, independent fashion designer. Lippes, who worked for Oscar de la Renta before starting his own label a decade ago, specializes in American sportswear; his dresses run in the $3,000 to $4,000 range. For Trump's first inauguration, Melanie wore a light blue dress by heritage brand Ralph Lauren (also a favourite designer of the Biden family) that drew comparisons to Jackie Kennedy's style.</p><p>\"Melania's look is restrained, classic, uniform like. It looks like a dramatic governess outfit,\" said Tracy Richardson, a Canadian image consultant who has dressed clients for the White House, Buckingham Palace, the Oscars, TIFF and the Junos. \"The hat is dramatic.

The Forest Fuels Management Project is being led by Lil\u2019wat Forestry Ventures Ltd (LFV). </p><p>The project is being conducted in a residential area above X-Stream Road in Mount Currie. Trees will be thinned in 50-acres of thick forest, while residents can also suggest what work they think should be done within 30 to 50 metres of their homes. </p><p>General manager of LFV, Klay Tindall, emphasized the importance of selective thinning work to create more resilient forests in a press release. </p><p>\u201cThis work is so important to help keep the community safer from the threat of wildfire, with many other significant benefits,\u201d said Tindall. \u201cThe selective thinning of the forest will not only mitigate the risk of wildfires to the local homes and properties but will also enhance residents\u2019 visibility to observe wildlife such as wolves, bears and cougars in the area to better ensure their family\u2019s safety.\u201d  </p><p>The work should also make it easier for berries, mushrooms and other plants to grow, while harvested wood will provide firewood for elders in the community this winter. </p><p>One of the challenges the project faces is a lack of provincial or federal funding. </p><p>\u201cDue to the size of the project, we are not eligible for the funding we require to do this work,\u201d Tindall said. \u201cThis work is important on so many levels, so we are moving forward to get the work done.\u201d  </p><p>Tindall is also calling on the community to make sure their homes are FireSmart before summer fire season. \u201cThe area between the fuel-management work and homes will require individual FireSmart work to help create the conditions to better protect homes,\u201d said Tindall. \u201cThis is why we\u2019re working with the Lil\u2019wat FireSmart coordinator and residents to determine what we can do between their homes and the forest to better prepare.\u201d  </p><p>LFV has additional plans to enhance forest management and community safety long-term. This includes planning out three harvest blocks on Lil\u2019wat Nation land where trees will be harvested using a partial harvest method, ensuring the retention of some trees.  </p><p>\u201cOur work will include harvesting along with cultural burning and monitoring to assess how these openings in the forest can better protect against wildfire while also assisting the growth of culturally important shrubs and herbs,\u201d Tindall said.  </p><p>Lil\u2019wat Nation\u2019s FireSmart coordinator, Dillon Bikadi, is working hard alongside his colleagues to protect the community. He previously told Pique they are preparing for a forest fire they hope never happens. The Lil\u2019wat FireSmart crew held its FireSmart Day on Saturday, April 27. Bikadi and volunteers offered to collect debris from people\u2019s yards and brought it to a gravel pit by Eddie Lake for chipping. Locals were encouraged to prune and clean their gardens to make the area more resilient to fires. People were also encouraged to send the organization photos of FireSmart activity for a chance of winning a prize. </p><p>Bikadi said the event was a huge success, and people now know the measures they need to take to keep their homes safe. \u201cThe loads that we were picking up from people who are doing their own treatments were quite large,\u201d he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e1703049a1f443e3a1c3d42085d82b5f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C5N-YDT1-DY9S-T0MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><timeReceived>11:09 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 2, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

C., July 29. Eleven men are known to have perished and a number are missing in a fire that swept the Spruce river valley, 15 miles northeast of here Saturday afternoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sixty odd men and about 20 teams were trapped in camp 14 of the Elk Lumber Company, which is situated in a blind valley and their flight over the mountains was most difficult.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eleven bodies have been picked up in the rear of the fire and the terrible agony the men endured is shown by their contorted features.</p><p>Nick Muscovich, a Russian, was found alive, his eyes burned sightless and almost demented. His body was severely burned and all his clothing was gone, except his boots, but after being given first aid he recovered and urged the rescuers to leave him and help men he knew to be beyond him. With assistance he walked to the emergency hospital and was later brought to Fernie, where his death is hourly expected.</p><p>Many of those on reaching points of safety were found to be temporarily demented from shock.</p><p>Millions of feet of logs, the logging railroad and the bush camp buildings, together with equipment, horses and supplies are a total loss. Ten fatalities is the lowest estimate.</p><p>The fire is now considered checked by the heavy showers that fell last night, but if the wind rises the blaze will be revived.</p><p>The fire had been burning since Wednesday in the vicinity of the Elk Lumber Company\u2019s camps and after destroying two of the lower camps was Saturday morning, after a two-day fight, well in hand and no further damage was thought probable.</p><p>Within an hour after relaxing their efforts, the almost exhausted fire fighters were required to respond to another alarm, but they were powerless to even approach the fire into which the dying embers of the former fire had been fanned by a hurricane which arose.</p><p>Doctors and relief parties wore dispatched at once to the scene but their efforts were practically unavailing as they were unable to approach to an effective distance the fire zone.</p><p>The escape of the majority of the men was miraculous.</p><p>Elko news \u2026 The forest fires have been very bad south of the town and some started by the Great Northern Trains got very close to town. It is the longest spell ever known around here without rain. and the sheep men west of the town were getting very anxious with fires all around them, but the monotony broke Saturday night when the rain came down in nice big chunks, and the green grass is once more growing all round.</p><p>Notice\u00a0 \u2014 Corporation of the City of Cranbrook: Notice to Users of Water. Owing to the great amount of water now being used throughout the City, due no doubt, to the excessive heat, the water pressure at the hydrants has been considerably reduced and users of water are requested to immediately turn off all taps and lawn services upon the Fire Alarm being sounded. Cranbrook, B. C\u201e July 16th 1917. Thos. M. Roberts, City Clerk</p><p>Narrow escape! \u2026 Mr. Wm. Hamilton, our pioneer fruit rancher had a narrow escape from death last week when he got tangled up in the horns of his prize bull.</p><p>It appears from information received that the bull charged Mr. Hamilton so suddenly that there was no alternative but to grab the bull by the horns, but unfortunately Mr. Hamilton\u2019s hand slipped on one of the horns and he fell prostrate on the bull\u2019s head.</p><p>The enraged animal, who probably thought he was being made the dupe of a toreador\u2019s prank lost no time in tossing his victim high in the air and landing him about twenty feet away. Mr. Hamilton came down on the side of his head and right shoulder and was so seriously injured that he could not move and were it not for the timely arrival of his faithful dog he probably would have been gored to death.</p><p>As it was the dog, by barking and snapping at the enraged beast, kept him away from his master until he had sufficiently escaped to reach a place of safety.</p><p>We are pleased to note that Mr. Hamilton is able to be around in spite of his thrilling experience.</p><p>Whooping cough \u2026 As there are a number of cases of whooping cough in town and in view of the approach of school opening, it is deemed advisable to take some precaution against the spread of the disease. The School Board have therefore procured sufficient quantity of vaccine to inoculate all the school children of Cranbrook.</p><p>Drs. Green and MacKinnon have offered to administer the vaccine treatment between the hours of 9 and 10 a.m. only, free of charge. Two injections at an interval of 4 to 5 days are advised as a preventative. Parents please take notice and present your children at the Doctors\u2019 office to be treated accordingly. H. White,</p><p>Chairman of School Board.</p><p>A suggestion for a returned soldier\u2019s home \u2026 Dear Sir, At the public meeting called some time ago for the purpose of discussing conscription the time when our men come home was frequently alluded to.</p><p>The question crossed my mind as to what \u201ccoming home\u201d really meant to many of these men. The canopy of heaven and the earth beneath with even an over-powering welcome at the station do not make \u201chome.\u201d</p><p>Cranbrook and the surrounding country has sent a large number in proportion to population. And from where do these men come? The mining and lumber camps, the isolated claim in the hills, and the lonely bachelor homestead have contributed not a few. Many of these men, born with the wandering foot, have lost all connection with their own kin in the east or the old country or at least have lost all sympathy with the more conventional life.</p><p>Right or wrong they will come back to the mountain province. What to do with these men when they return confronts British Columbia to a greater extent than any other province unless it be New Ontario.</p><p>For the very ill there will be hospital service a plenty, and for the semi-invalid the sanitarium; but the man with little education and less money, who has made his living with his hands, where is he to find a home?</p><p>Would it not be wise to think and prepare for these men in some way that they may keep their sense of independence and as far as possible a wholesome view of life?</p><p>Could not Cranbrook have something of a home ready for these men when they come? I do not mean a barracks or an \u201cinstitution,\u201d but a headquarters as near a home as it can be made with living well within the veteran\u2019s income.</p><p>One of my earliest recollections is of two old men sitting by the fire swapping stories of 1837. One was my grandfather. Let this home have a large assembly room, with a big open fire, substantial homelike furniture, plenty of books and papers and a gramophone. Though the bedrooms may necessarily be small, but so that any man who needs it may find a place of his very own, at a price well within his means. Let the cuisine be good and homelike and above all provide a tasteful cheerful woman with a knowledge of nursing as Matron.</p><p>Let these men go out and get a week\u2019s work or a month\u2019s work and be encouraged to do so; but there will be times when all of these men will have nerves that will rebel at the outrages they received \u201csomewhere in France.\u201d It is then these must feel that they have some place to go.</p><p>And in a quiet corner of this home, let there be a tablet In memory of those, who directly from France have gone to the \u201cBetter Home.\u201d \u2026 A Canadian Woman.</p><p>Cause of forest fires\u00a0 \u2026 The forest fire situation is one which every good citizen should thoughtfully consider. At this time when fires are raging in all directions a passing thought is given to the immense damage that is being wrought, and the lives that are being lost, but consideration is seldom given to the fact that the greater number of these devastating fires are preventable.</p><p>Statistics show that few fires start from natural causes, practically all being traced to negligence on the part of some careless individual. Fishermen, smokers, campers, travellers, and berry pickers, etc., are responsible for a high percentage of our fires. Many more are traceable to this source than are set by our combined railway systems.</p><p>All burning permits have been cancelled and no further permits will be issued until further notice, and now that the fire danger from this source has been removed it remains with those persons who have cause to use fire in any form for domestic reasons to exercise the utmost care in controlling same and to carefully extinguish their fire before they leave it.</p><p>Smokers particularly should never consider throwing away a burning match, cigar, or cigarette stub in the bush, along country roads, or any place where combustible matter can be found until all resemblance of fire is carefully put out.</p><p>Forest fire loss is absolute loss both to the community and to the individual and should be regarded in that light. If you should notice an outbreak at any time, notify the nearest Fire Warden at once and get in touch with the District Forester at Cranbrook, when the fire at once will be looked after.</p><p>Woman in the New Age (By W. H. Bridge) \u2026 Evil conditions, economic and moral, are in the nature of things transient; nature is always finding a solution. Thank heaven the forces of nature are all on the side of the clean and decent, all the misery under the sun results from man\u2019s purblind neglect of\u00a0 his obligations to nature.</p><p>Woman in the New Age is going to be one of nature\u2019s great remedial forces; she is going to bring to the fore, and boost, certain qualities of human nature, certain principles of action, which the masculine tendency is to belittle.</p><p>We have all the ingredients we need for a tiptop decent and permanent civilization, but the mixture is wrong. Our new cook will bring her own recipes and we may hope for a little less sour dough in politics.</p><p>An examination of what women have done in other countries will convince the sceptical of what is possible here; and incidentally give a lead to the women of Cranbrook who are already in arms.</p><p>The male politicians think instinctively of mines, lands and forests, of railroad contracts (and graft). Good for him; these matters demand attention.</p><p>But the woman thinks of the child and her problem is how to produce the best child. From the child her interest is led to the home and the school; and thence to problems of industry and labor.</p><p>The circle of her interests expands; it embraces mines, lands and forests and railroads ultimately. But the child is the centre and other things fall into place. All through, she puts first the things that the man puts last.</p><p>It is the fact of this antipodal difference of interest between the male and female politician that will make it impossible for women to fall into existing partisan groups. None of the Acts we have named can be labelled as peculiarly Liberal, Conservative or Socialist. Our subsequent study of the effects of women\u2019s work in other countries will emphasize this same fact. The woman\u2019s point of view when it is developed and emancipated will be essentially non-partisan.</p><p>We do not believe that the new vote will be a sex vote; nor will it be a new party vote. It will be a penetration into existing parties of a new spirit and outlook. The influence of the women in the party associations will be that of a leaven leavening the lump. The trouble is these \u2018lumps\u2019 don\u2019t\u00a0 wish to be leavened!</p><p>The influence of our women in politics will depend entirely upon their independence, whether they are partisan or non-partisan, and upon their vision of the things that may be.</p><p>Seth Ryckman passes \u2026 It is with very sincere regret that we have to announce the death of so prominent and valued a citizen as Seth W. Ryckman, which took place in Victoria on Wednesday evening according to advices received here yesterday.</p><p>Mr. Ryckman has been ailing since the early part of the winter when his life was seriously threatened by a severe attack upon the heart. Rallying somewhat with the warmer weather he and his wife left about one month ago on a trip to the coast where it was hoped that he would regain some of his former strength. At first it was thought that this end was to be gained as on arrival at Victoria he immediately found his breathing much improved.</p><p>The respite has been very short lived, however, and on Wednesday evening last he passed away having almost reached the allotted space of a man\u2019s life on earth.</p><p>In the passing of Mr. Ryckman, this community suffers a severe loss, and loses one of those men in whose hearts the history and welfare of the city was enshrined as a very precious thing.</p><p>Having spent the most of his life in the city of Waterdown, Ontario, where he followed the business of painter and decorator he heard the call of the west some sixteen years ago and came to Cranbrook and immediately started work with the C.P. R. at his own line of business.</p><p>He thus becomes one of the pioneer citizens of this district and any who have been associated with him in either early or latter days will only remember him as a man of honor and integrity; a man who loved his home, who revered his God, who worked for the church and the community and who could always be relied upon to give his support to anything that was calculated to advance the interests of his fellow men.</p><p>He was one of the few men in life whose strength of character and attractiveness of disposition enabled him to return to the home from whence he had taken his wife, in order to find another companion when the first had been taken from his side.</p><p>Mr. Ryckman was first married to Miss Crosby of Burlington, Ontario, to whom there was born two sons, Warren, who is now a medical practitioner in Hamilton, and Fred, who is a successful farmer in Saskatchewan.</p><p>As intimated at the decease of his first wife her sister took her place and she has been through the years they have been spared to each other a faithful and devoted wife and a very efficient helpmate.</p><p>The sincere sympathy of The Herald is extended to the bereaved wife and the sorrowing relatives.</p><p>Public meeting called \u2026\u00a0 The following letter has been received by Mayor Clapp and in accordance with the request in the same a Public Meeting is called for Saturday afternoon, August 4th in the City Hall.</p><p>Sir - I have the honor, by direction, to acquaint you that the Honorable the Premier is in receipt of a letter from Right Honorable the Prime Minister in which Sir Robert Borden refers to meetings being held on the 4th of August last year in various parts of the country to commemorate the anniversary of the Declaration of War and remarks that this was in accordance with a similar movement n the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the Empire, and that it is proposed to repeat this celebration on the 4th of August next.</p><p>The Central Committee For National Patriotic Organisations in London has issued a notice on the subject containing the text of a resolution which it is\u00a0 suggested could be moved at all meetings, namely:\u2014 \u201cThat on this anniversary of the declaration of a righteous war this meeting of the citizens of Cranbrook record its inflexible determination to continue to a victorious end the struggle in maintenance of those ideals of liberty and justice which are the common and sacred cause of the Allies.\u201d</p><p>A Campbell Reddie, Deputy Provincial Secretary.</p><p>Competitions for boys and girls \u2026 Through the action of the Minister of Agriculture, The Honorable Martin Burrell, arrangements have been made to have the Canadian Bankers\u2019 Association co-operate with the Department of Agriculture in providing a liberal sum of money to be offered in prizes for calves and pigs exhibited by boys or girls under 17 years of age, at county or township fairs.</p><p>These competitions are known as the \u201cCanadian Bankers\u2019 Competitions,\u201d and are linked up with the activities of the Live Stock Branch of the Dominion Department of Agriculture. They represent an effort to increase interest in livestock, and constitute a part of the active campaign for more and better stock inaugurated and carried on by The Honorable Mr. Burrell through his Department.</p><p>The generous support accorded to the movement by the Canadian Bankers\u2019 Association, affords a practical demonstration of the attitude of the banks towards the livestock industry, and the active participation of the Association in this campaign is bound to strengthen and create general interest in farm livestock.</p><p>Canadian Bankers\u2019 Competitions will be held at a large number of shows this year, and boys and girls should lose no time in finding out all about them.</p><p>The calves and pigs must be fed at least six weeks by the boys and girls who will exhibit them, so that it is very important to act promptly in securing a copy of the rules and other information.</p><p>Full information regarding the competitions can be obtained from the manager of any branch bank in the locality where a fall fair is held.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Cranbrook Townsman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20240729GCAGG4626142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CKP-6S41-JD2C-J001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

The ban applies to category 2 and 3 open fires \u2013 which refers to piles of material in backyard or industrial burning \u2013 as well as stubble or grass.

Any person found contravening the ban will be liable for a fine of up to $1,150.</p><p>For more fire safety information visit mapleridge.ca/wildfire.</p><p>In the meantime, the City of Pitt Meadows warns that the spring agricultural burning season has been cancelled until further notice, due to the ban across the Coast Fire Centre. Burning permits will not be available.</p><p>The city also reminded residents that open wood burning is not permitted at any time, anywhere in urban areas in Pitt Meadows. This includes outdoor fireplaces and cooking pits. Propane and natural gas are permitted.</p><p>More information about burning in the city is available at pittmeadows.ca.</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service burning ban in the Coastal Fire Centre will be in place until Oct. 31, or until the order is rescinded.</p><p>To report a wildfire, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free OR *5555 on most cellular networks.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:neil.corbett@mapleridgenews.com\">neil.corbett@mapleridgenews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MARNWS-news20240531PQVA0004408563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MARNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C53-Y0X1-JD2C-J4BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438227</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

They were expected to arrive on Sunday. <br/> Local media reported that a 67-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion he started the blaze. <br/><url

Since then, the drought in the Peace and Fort Nelson districts has gotten much worse. </p><p>\u201cThe impacts are super obvious if you've either been to the region or just seen the news about the wildfires and the struggle with farmers and BC Hydro with water access for water this year and last year,\u201d said Biggs. </p><p>A June 25 report commissioned by the David Suzuki Foundation puts the total water use even higher at about 9.7 billion litres in B.C. Biggs said this discrepancy is because Stand.earth only looked at fresh water from rivers and lakes \u2014 other sources of water (deep wells and privately owned man-made runoff ponds) are not disclosed by the BC Energy Regulator because they don\u2019t require a licence. To reach an estimate for total water including these sources, the David Suzuki Foundation did analysis based on how much water is used in drilling operations, as well. </p><p>\u201cWe think roughly a third of the water used by industry comes from these unregulated sources,\u201d said Biggs. </p><p>That total \u2014 9.7 billion litres of water \u2014 is more than enough to fill every public swimming pool in Canada. </p><p>A Leger poll, commissioned by a coalition of environmental groups including Stand.earth, asked respondents if the government should regulate and reduce the amount of fresh water used by oil and gas companies. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed. The online poll ran from May 30 to June 10 and surveyed 1,000 Canadians on issues like forestry, fracking and energy efficiency. More than half the people surveyed were from the Lower Mainland, Sea-to-Sky and Fraser Valley regions. </p><p>B.C. is poised to expand its LNG industry with six projects in various stages of development. Environmentalists warn that a surge in fracking and LNG projects is incompatible with the province meeting its climate targets. </p><p>It\u2019s hard to put a price on water, said Biggs, but one of Stand.earth\u2019s recommendations is for the provincial government to charge fracking companies a high enough price to encourage the conservation of fresh water. </p><p>\u201cA cent a litre seems like the absolute minimum that the government should be asking for,\u201d he said. The current price is one four-hundredth of that. </p><p>Requiring companies to treat wastewater and reuse it in fracking operations would also help reduce the amount of fresh water contaminated by the industry, the report noted. </p><p>The federal government\u2019s projections indicate the wildfire risk in Canada is expected to remain high this summer, particularly in regions plagued by \u201cintense drought,\u201d including northeastern B.C. Last summer, a fire in the Peace region burned up an area larger than Prince Edward Island, making it the largest forest fire in B.C.\u2019s history.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e25f3d4056284d4e97ac70c00bd9ee03</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CF4-XV41-JBVR-30H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>11:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 7, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This summer\u2019s Toronto flooding was valued at $940 million in insured damage. The fire in Jasper National Park that scorched the town cost $880 million. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anishnawbe Business Professional Association president, Jason Rasevych, is contextualizing those costs to Toronto and Jasper with how planting a tree has a $6.50 value on Canada\u2019s GDP. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The development expert from Ginoogaming First Nation near Thunder Bay foresees Northern Ontario First Nations leading land stewardship projects in the fight against climate change. He believes the value of intact natural systems is an untapped market \u2013 and he\u2019s courting investors </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWhen we think of nature, we have to think about it as an infrastructure that provides services to the economy,\u201d Rasevych says. \u201cIf the economy continues to impact nature, we won\u2019t have that infrastructure and we\u2019ll continue to see catastrophic events like floods and wildfires.\u201d </p><p>Instead of interpreting the environment as an externality, the rapidly-expanding conservation approach known as Nature-based Climate Solutions (NCS) lends formal value to the benefit these \u201cecosystem services\u201d provide the economy. NCS are going mainstream on every continent as an economic strategy to reduce CO2 emissions, with measures as diverse as stormwater diversion to carbon sequestration, under organizations from the World Wildlife Fund to the World Bank. </p><p>A new joint study from Nature United and the Smart Prosperity Institute released on October 1 suggests Indigenous communities have a \u201ccritical\u201d role in \u201cunlocking the economic potential of NCS in Canada,\u201d which those groups foresee providing a 20-fold return on investment. </p><p>Rasevych took that case to Climate Week, the world\u2019s largest climate conference in New York this month. He appealed to investors and philanthropists alike: Canada cannot meet its carbon reduction targets without Indigenous communities; likewise, Indigenous communities cannot incur the up-front conservation costs without external investment. </p><p>\u201cThe major call to action was for private investment support and developing a stronger economic or business case for valuing nature as an ecosystem services provider to the economy,\u201d he said. </p><p>If Canada pivots to NCS solutions by 2030, the country could reduce emissions by 11 per cent (78 megatonnes of carbon dioxide annually), according to a landmark study that 17 research institutions conducted in 2021. Despite the federal government having invested over $1.3 billion to advance Indigenous-led conservation efforts, Rasevych believes government grants for climate solutions will prove insufficient, too slow, and prone to partisanship. </p><p>He joins those calling for a \u201cblended\u201d financing model, wherein Indigenous communities would supplement public grants with philanthropic donations and private investment. As Canada moves to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), he believes Indigenous people and communities can have tools and protections to confidently develop relationships with the charitable and for-profit sectors, while helping to meet Canada\u2019s climate goals by 2030. </p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve got a commitment from the government,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we need is more capacity dollars. We need more, better access to data, and we need to be able to develop the right type of accounting models for natural resources, so the investors could identify what the opportunities are here, and that they\u2019re properly compensated for their investment.\u201d </p><p>He sees tribes in the United States as leading a variety of solutions, where regulations are becoming friendlier to combine public conservation dollars with philanthropic commitments and private sector investments, to reinforce the inherent value of intact natural ecosystems.  </p><p>Even if Natural Resources Canada spent 20 per cent of the $5-billion infrastructure loan guarantee it commits to resource extractive industries like mining or forestry, Rasevych argues, it could ignite this type of blended financing model with market confidence. </p><p>\u201cIf these dollars are going to be used to advance the government\u2019s agenda related to pipelines out west or related to extraction sectors, then some of it should be counterbalanced to invest in these climate action initiatives,\u201d he says. </p><p>Some examples: -  In Washington, DC, a stormwater retention credit trade has incentivized green infrastructure construction that its architects estimate has captured more than 40 million gallons of runoff over the past decade. </p><p>-  In California, a $1.5-million investment from the Yuba Water Agency in upriver reforestation and forest fire prevention leveraged $4 million in private capital. That, in turn, unlocked more interest-free state loans. The Yuba Forest Resilience Bond partnership advertises the arrangement sped up the project by six years, while making a second, larger project possible, estimated at $25-million. </p><p>-  In Kitaskino Nuwen\u00ebn\u00e9 Wildland Park in Alberta, the Mikisew Cree First Nation, the province of Alberta, and industrial interests including Imperial Oil, have invested $5.3 million in preserving bison and caribou protection habitat, while developing ecotourism </p><p>-  A 2009 agreement between the Coastal First Nations and British Columbia formed the Great Bear Carbon Credit Limited Partnership, one of the first and largest carbon offset projects in the world. Under the Atmospheric Benefit Sharing Agreement, the First Nations receive 80 per cent of carbon credit sales revenue, which spares one of the world\u2019s most carbon-productive, old growth forests from logging. </p><p>The Hudson Bay lowland, north of Rasevych\u2019s home community of Ginoogaming First Nation, is storing between 30 and 40 billion tonnes of carbon. The area has the second-highest concentration of peat on Earth, next to the Congo. The only reason Northern Ontario First Nations aren\u2019t in the same economic position to benefit from ecological protection as the nine Coastal First Nations in B.C., he says, is political will. </p><p>\u201cWhen I talk about the treaties, we didn\u2019t have discussions on any \u2018atmospheric benefit sharing agreements\u2019 back then. But you would assume the land, the air, the water, the ecosystem is a consideration that was discussed around exercising treaty rights and the inherent responsibility of Indigenous peoples to be stewards of the land; caretakers for what\u2019s used in the western ways \u2013 the scientific way \u2013 as biodiversity.\u201d </p><p>\u2018A patently unreliable and untrustworthy treaty partner\u2019 </p><p>The global movement to assess ecological values is happening at the same time as a constitutional shift in Northern Ontario. </p><p>In July, the 17 First Nations signatory to the Robinson-Huron Treaty won a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in a case about withheld annuities that holds deep implications for valuing both extracted and intact natural resources. </p><p>Restoule v. Canada not only resolved that the First Nations located between Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, and Parry Sound did not cede the land in signing the treaty, but interpreted the four-dollar annuities the Crown pays each member to be subject to resource sharing benefits. </p><p>Members of Robinson-Huron and their westward neighbours Robinson-Superior hadn\u2019t received an increase to those annuities since 1875. </p><p>\u201cFor well over a century, the Crown has shown itself to be a patently unreliable and untrustworthy treaty partner in relation to the augmentation promise,\u201d Justice Mahmud Jamal wrote in his ruling. </p><p>A negotiating process led Canada and Ontario to contribute $5 billion each for Robinson-Huron communities, while Robinson-Superior Anishinabek continues to seek $126 billion. </p><p>The quantification of resource values is game-changing according to ecological economist Mark Anielski, whose firm studies the relationship between economic indicators and the well-being of individuals in First Nations. </p><p>Anielski is working with Robinson-Huron First Nations on quantifying both resource and natural values in northeastern Ontario. He says that if the provinces aren\u2019t valuing resources enough to count them on their balance sheets, First Nations are entitled to calculate those values themselves in order to seek economic partners, whether that be for development, protecting carbon sinks or restoring caribou habitat. </p><p>\u201cRight now, the provinces don\u2019t account for the liabilities of the environment at all, so that means your credit rating as a province or as a country is not accurate. It changes the whole position and perspective of the so-called international investment world and markets have been blind to. We\u2019re playing chess where we were playing poker with the cards face-up.\u201d   </p><p>Jesse Cardinal is the executive director of Keepers of the Water, an Indigenous-led environmental protection group working in the Arctic Ocean Drainage Basin. </p><p>She\u2019s seen what she describes as partisan efforts in Alberta that are camouflaging fossil fuel subsidies as both green energy and opportunities for First Nations. </p><p>During the NDP\u2019s single term governing Alberta between 2015 and 2019, the province launched the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation (AIOC), a program to match public partnership funds with First Nations looking to benefit from a diversifying energy mix.  </p><p>When the UCP was elected in 2019, those programs reverted to favouring fossil fuel partnerships. </p><p>\u201cIt just got really messy really quickly because all it did was incentivize First Nations to further entrench themselves in fossil fuel extraction instead of supporting the path and the vision a lot of communities have of getting away from fossil fuel extraction and diversifying the economy.\u201d </p><p>Between the province directly enabling coal, oil and gas expansion, to unreasonable ambitions for carbon sequestration, to the federal government encouraging extractive processes to develop nuclear energy, Cardinal says the cost of public support for Indigenous-led conservation efforts can be used to repackage the status quo. </p><p>\u201cCanada is implicated in these false solutions or nature-based solutions that are really just linked directly to industry, to continue to have industry, to continue with business as usual, while subsidizing their business as usual,\u201d she says. </p><p>Cardinal says Indigenous self-governance and autonomy over land management is the only path that will lead to sustainable ecology. </p><p>When Rasevych spoke at Climate Week in New York, investors and philanthropists also heard from Asubpeeschoseewagong Anishinabek (Grassy Narrows First Nation) elder and decorated human rights activist Judy Da Silva. </p><p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, staff of the pulp and paper mill in Dryden dumped nearly 10 tonnes of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system. New studies earlier this year revealed the effluent that the mill is still dumping into the river is exacerbating the methylmercury effects on the aquaculture. </p><p>Da Silva says the need to do business differently is urgent. </p><p>\u201cIndigenous people are the first contact for industrial devastation. We have no time to be wasting, the way the earth is going, we need to stop industry right now. We in Grassy Narrows face mercury poisoning. The people are sick, and I\u2019m getting sick. The mercury symptoms are getting stronger on me. We need to do this change now for the children that are not born yet. That\u2019s the frame of mind we need to have.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7b2aca60837d4a769d80b3db936b4f8a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D5M-4W61-DY9S-T4S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1886\"/><timeReceived>01:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 11, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

C., July 29. Eleven men are known to have perished and a number are missing in a fire that swept the Spruce river valley, 15 miles northeast of here Saturday afternoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sixty odd men and about 20 teams were trapped in camp 14 of the Elk Lumber Company, which is situated in a blind valley and their flight over the mountains was most difficult.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eleven bodies have been picked up in the rear of the fire and the terrible agony the men endured is shown by their contorted features.</p><p>Nick Muscovich, a Russian, was found alive, his eyes burned sightless and almost demented. His body was severely burned and all his clothing was gone, except his boots, but after being given first aid he recovered and urged the rescuers to leave him and help men he knew to be beyond him. With assistance he walked to the emergency hospital and was later brought to Fernie, where his death is hourly expected.</p><p>Many of those on reaching points of safety were found to be temporarily demented from shock.</p><p>Millions of feet of logs, the logging railroad and the bush camp buildings, together with equipment, horses and supplies are a total loss. Ten fatalities is the lowest estimate.</p><p>The fire is now considered checked by the heavy showers that fell last night, but if the wind rises the blaze will be revived.</p><p>The fire had been burning since Wednesday in the vicinity of the Elk Lumber Company\u2019s camps and after destroying two of the lower camps was Saturday morning, after a two-day fight, well in hand and no further damage was thought probable.</p><p>Within an hour after relaxing their efforts, the almost exhausted fire fighters were required to respond to another alarm, but they were powerless to even approach the fire into which the dying embers of the former fire had been fanned by a hurricane which arose.</p><p>Doctors and relief parties wore dispatched at once to the scene but their efforts were practically unavailing as they were unable to approach to an effective distance the fire zone.</p><p>The escape of the majority of the men was miraculous.</p><p>Elko news \u2026 The forest fires have been very bad south of the town and some started by the Great Northern Trains got very close to town. It is the longest spell ever known around here without rain. and the sheep men west of the town were getting very anxious with fires all around them, but the monotony broke Saturday night when the rain came down in nice big chunks, and the green grass is once more growing all round.</p><p>Notice\u00a0 \u2014 Corporation of the City of Cranbrook: Notice to Users of Water. Owing to the great amount of water now being used throughout the City, due no doubt, to the excessive heat, the water pressure at the hydrants has been considerably reduced and users of water are requested to immediately turn off all taps and lawn services upon the Fire Alarm being sounded. Cranbrook, B. C\u201e July 16th 1917. Thos. M. Roberts, City Clerk</p><p>Narrow escape! \u2026 Mr. Wm. Hamilton, our pioneer fruit rancher had a narrow escape from death last week when he got tangled up in the horns of his prize bull.</p><p>It appears from information received that the bull charged Mr. Hamilton so suddenly that there was no alternative but to grab the bull by the horns, but unfortunately Mr. Hamilton\u2019s hand slipped on one of the horns and he fell prostrate on the bull\u2019s head.</p><p>The enraged animal, who probably thought he was being made the dupe of a toreador\u2019s prank lost no time in tossing his victim high in the air and landing him about twenty feet away. Mr. Hamilton came down on the side of his head and right shoulder and was so seriously injured that he could not move and were it not for the timely arrival of his faithful dog he probably would have been gored to death.</p><p>As it was the dog, by barking and snapping at the enraged beast, kept him away from his master until he had sufficiently escaped to reach a place of safety.</p><p>We are pleased to note that Mr. Hamilton is able to be around in spite of his thrilling experience.</p><p>Whooping cough \u2026 As there are a number of cases of whooping cough in town and in view of the approach of school opening, it is deemed advisable to take some precaution against the spread of the disease. The School Board have therefore procured sufficient quantity of vaccine to inoculate all the school children of Cranbrook.</p><p>Drs. Green and MacKinnon have offered to administer the vaccine treatment between the hours of 9 and 10 a.m. only, free of charge. Two injections at an interval of 4 to 5 days are advised as a preventative. Parents please take notice and present your children at the Doctors\u2019 office to be treated accordingly. H. White,</p><p>Chairman of School Board.</p><p>A suggestion for a returned soldier\u2019s home \u2026 Dear Sir, At the public meeting called some time ago for the purpose of discussing conscription the time when our men come home was frequently alluded to.</p><p>The question crossed my mind as to what \u201ccoming home\u201d really meant to many of these men. The canopy of heaven and the earth beneath with even an over-powering welcome at the station do not make \u201chome.\u201d</p><p>Cranbrook and the surrounding country has sent a large number in proportion to population. And from where do these men come? The mining and lumber camps, the isolated claim in the hills, and the lonely bachelor homestead have contributed not a few. Many of these men, born with the wandering foot, have lost all connection with their own kin in the east or the old country or at least have lost all sympathy with the more conventional life.</p><p>Right or wrong they will come back to the mountain province. What to do with these men when they return confronts British Columbia to a greater extent than any other province unless it be New Ontario.</p><p>For the very ill there will be hospital service a plenty, and for the semi-invalid the sanitarium; but the man with little education and less money, who has made his living with his hands, where is he to find a home?</p><p>Would it not be wise to think and prepare for these men in some way that they may keep their sense of independence and as far as possible a wholesome view of life?</p><p>Could not Cranbrook have something of a home ready for these men when they come? I do not mean a barracks or an \u201cinstitution,\u201d but a headquarters as near a home as it can be made with living well within the veteran\u2019s income.</p><p>One of my earliest recollections is of two old men sitting by the fire swapping stories of 1837. One was my grandfather. Let this home have a large assembly room, with a big open fire, substantial homelike furniture, plenty of books and papers and a gramophone. Though the bedrooms may necessarily be small, but so that any man who needs it may find a place of his very own, at a price well within his means. Let the cuisine be good and homelike and above all provide a tasteful cheerful woman with a knowledge of nursing as Matron.</p><p>Let these men go out and get a week\u2019s work or a month\u2019s work and be encouraged to do so; but there will be times when all of these men will have nerves that will rebel at the outrages they received \u201csomewhere in France.\u201d It is then these must feel that they have some place to go.</p><p>And in a quiet corner of this home, let there be a tablet In memory of those, who directly from France have gone to the \u201cBetter Home.\u201d \u2026 A Canadian Woman.</p><p>Cause of forest fires\u00a0 \u2026 The forest fire situation is one which every good citizen should thoughtfully consider. At this time when fires are raging in all directions a passing thought is given to the immense damage that is being wrought, and the lives that are being lost, but consideration is seldom given to the fact that the greater number of these devastating fires are preventable.</p><p>Statistics show that few fires start from natural causes, practically all being traced to negligence on the part of some careless individual. Fishermen, smokers, campers, travellers, and berry pickers, etc., are responsible for a high percentage of our fires. Many more are traceable to this source than are set by our combined railway systems.</p><p>All burning permits have been cancelled and no further permits will be issued until further notice, and now that the fire danger from this source has been removed it remains with those persons who have cause to use fire in any form for domestic reasons to exercise the utmost care in controlling same and to carefully extinguish their fire before they leave it.</p><p>Smokers particularly should never consider throwing away a burning match, cigar, or cigarette stub in the bush, along country roads, or any place where combustible matter can be found until all resemblance of fire is carefully put out.</p><p>Forest fire loss is absolute loss both to the community and to the individual and should be regarded in that light. If you should notice an outbreak at any time, notify the nearest Fire Warden at once and get in touch with the District Forester at Cranbrook, when the fire at once will be looked after.</p><p>Woman in the New Age (By W. H. Bridge) \u2026 Evil conditions, economic and moral, are in the nature of things transient; nature is always finding a solution. Thank heaven the forces of nature are all on the side of the clean and decent, all the misery under the sun results from man\u2019s purblind neglect of\u00a0 his obligations to nature.</p><p>Woman in the New Age is going to be one of nature\u2019s great remedial forces; she is going to bring to the fore, and boost, certain qualities of human nature, certain principles of action, which the masculine tendency is to belittle.</p><p>We have all the ingredients we need for a tiptop decent and permanent civilization, but the mixture is wrong. Our new cook will bring her own recipes and we may hope for a little less sour dough in politics.</p><p>An examination of what women have done in other countries will convince the sceptical of what is possible here; and incidentally give a lead to the women of Cranbrook who are already in arms.</p><p>The male politicians think instinctively of mines, lands and forests, of railroad contracts (and graft). Good for him; these matters demand attention.</p><p>But the woman thinks of the child and her problem is how to produce the best child. From the child her interest is led to the home and the school; and thence to problems of industry and labor.</p><p>The circle of her interests expands; it embraces mines, lands and forests and railroads ultimately. But the child is the centre and other things fall into place. All through, she puts first the things that the man puts last.</p><p>It is the fact of this antipodal difference of interest between the male and female politician that will make it impossible for women to fall into existing partisan groups. None of the Acts we have named can be labelled as peculiarly Liberal, Conservative or Socialist. Our subsequent study of the effects of women\u2019s work in other countries will emphasize this same fact. The woman\u2019s point of view when it is developed and emancipated will be essentially non-partisan.</p><p>We do not believe that the new vote will be a sex vote; nor will it be a new party vote. It will be a penetration into existing parties of a new spirit and outlook. The influence of the women in the party associations will be that of a leaven leavening the lump. The trouble is these \u2018lumps\u2019 don\u2019t\u00a0 wish to be leavened!</p><p>The influence of our women in politics will depend entirely upon their independence, whether they are partisan or non-partisan, and upon their vision of the things that may be.</p><p>Seth Ryckman passes \u2026 It is with very sincere regret that we have to announce the death of so prominent and valued a citizen as Seth W. Ryckman, which took place in Victoria on Wednesday evening according to advices received here yesterday.</p><p>Mr. Ryckman has been ailing since the early part of the winter when his life was seriously threatened by a severe attack upon the heart. Rallying somewhat with the warmer weather he and his wife left about one month ago on a trip to the coast where it was hoped that he would regain some of his former strength. At first it was thought that this end was to be gained as on arrival at Victoria he immediately found his breathing much improved.</p><p>The respite has been very short lived, however, and on Wednesday evening last he passed away having almost reached the allotted space of a man\u2019s life on earth.</p><p>In the passing of Mr. Ryckman, this community suffers a severe loss, and loses one of those men in whose hearts the history and welfare of the city was enshrined as a very precious thing.</p><p>Having spent the most of his life in the city of Waterdown, Ontario, where he followed the business of painter and decorator he heard the call of the west some sixteen years ago and came to Cranbrook and immediately started work with the C.P. R. at his own line of business.</p><p>He thus becomes one of the pioneer citizens of this district and any who have been associated with him in either early or latter days will only remember him as a man of honor and integrity; a man who loved his home, who revered his God, who worked for the church and the community and who could always be relied upon to give his support to anything that was calculated to advance the interests of his fellow men.</p><p>He was one of the few men in life whose strength of character and attractiveness of disposition enabled him to return to the home from whence he had taken his wife, in order to find another companion when the first had been taken from his side.</p><p>Mr. Ryckman was first married to Miss Crosby of Burlington, Ontario, to whom there was born two sons, Warren, who is now a medical practitioner in Hamilton, and Fred, who is a successful farmer in Saskatchewan.</p><p>As intimated at the decease of his first wife her sister took her place and she has been through the years they have been spared to each other a faithful and devoted wife and a very efficient helpmate.</p><p>The sincere sympathy of The Herald is extended to the bereaved wife and the sorrowing relatives.</p><p>Public meeting called \u2026\u00a0 The following letter has been received by Mayor Clapp and in accordance with the request in the same a Public Meeting is called for Saturday afternoon, August 4th in the City Hall.</p><p>Sir - I have the honor, by direction, to acquaint you that the Honorable the Premier is in receipt of a letter from Right Honorable the Prime Minister in which Sir Robert Borden refers to meetings being held on the 4th of August last year in various parts of the country to commemorate the anniversary of the Declaration of War and remarks that this was in accordance with a similar movement n the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the Empire, and that it is proposed to repeat this celebration on the 4th of August next.</p><p>The Central Committee For National Patriotic Organisations in London has issued a notice on the subject containing the text of a resolution which it is\u00a0 suggested could be moved at all meetings, namely:\u2014 \u201cThat on this anniversary of the declaration of a righteous war this meeting of the citizens of Cranbrook record its inflexible determination to continue to a victorious end the struggle in maintenance of those ideals of liberty and justice which are the common and sacred cause of the Allies.\u201d</p><p>A Campbell Reddie, Deputy Provincial Secretary.</p><p>Competitions for boys and girls \u2026 Through the action of the Minister of Agriculture, The Honorable Martin Burrell, arrangements have been made to have the Canadian Bankers\u2019 Association co-operate with the Department of Agriculture in providing a liberal sum of money to be offered in prizes for calves and pigs exhibited by boys or girls under 17 years of age, at county or township fairs.</p><p>These competitions are known as the \u201cCanadian Bankers\u2019 Competitions,\u201d and are linked up with the activities of the Live Stock Branch of the Dominion Department of Agriculture. They represent an effort to increase interest in livestock, and constitute a part of the active campaign for more and better stock inaugurated and carried on by The Honorable Mr. Burrell through his Department.</p><p>The generous support accorded to the movement by the Canadian Bankers\u2019 Association, affords a practical demonstration of the attitude of the banks towards the livestock industry, and the active participation of the Association in this campaign is bound to strengthen and create general interest in farm livestock.</p><p>Canadian Bankers\u2019 Competitions will be held at a large number of shows this year, and boys and girls should lose no time in finding out all about them.</p><p>The calves and pigs must be fed at least six weeks by the boys and girls who will exhibit them, so that it is very important to act promptly in securing a copy of the rules and other information.</p><p>Full information regarding the competitions can be obtained from the manager of any branch bank in the locality where a fall fair is held.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Cranbrook Townsman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20240725GCAGG4626142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CJV-BX21-F0HF-8361-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.
