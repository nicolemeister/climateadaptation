Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Muskoka. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060668112168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-KNP1-F197-50HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Poor air quality may persist into the weekend.</p><p>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW</p><p>NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE</p><p>According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.</p><p>You might be interested in</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Related Stories</p><p>Muskoka Fire Danger Rating 2023</p><p>Restricted Fire Zone order in effect June 1 for Muskoka, Parry Sound, Almaguin</p><p>Are you prepared in case of a wildfire Parry Sound-Muskoka?</p><p>UPDATE: Day 5 for 2 forest fires continuing to burn in Algonquin Park</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution.

We\u2019re looking forward to seeing what comes of that,\u201d she said. </p><p>In a statement provided to Dougall Media, ECCC\u2019s spokesperson Samuel Lafontaine said this pilot project has been going on in communities across the country since 2018 in partnership with the University of Northern British Columbia. </p><p>\u201cECCC is continually striving to improve all the services it provides to the people of Canada. Part of this effort involves partnering with the University of Northern British Columbia on a pilot project for low-cost air quality sensors. The aim of the pilot project is to evaluate the potential of this new technology to improve Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) forecasts and related services for people in Canada,\u201d Lafontaine wrote. </p><p>\u201cAs part of the pilot project, ECCC has partnered with organizations across Canada to install several low-cost fine particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors in rural and remote communities that are at risk from forest fire smoke. PM2.5 is a component of forest fire smoke that reduces surface visibility and causes health problems, especially for at-risk populations including children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with lung and heart disease.\u201d </p><p>Lafontaine said ECCC\u2019s partnership with the University of Northern British Columbia also produced an air quality map tool that \u201cgives external organizations access to real-time, quality-assured PM2.5 concentrations\u201d measured by installed sensors. </p><p>Law said the data collected by the sensor is publicly accessible. She encouraged residents of Manitouwadge who are interested in learning more about the project or simply want to see the data to visit this page.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8bf4e55cfc984632b08670f6ee1abc06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BH4-NVK1-DY9S-T15T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><timeReceived>03:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 7, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By the time I got there a structural protection unit (SPU) had set up sprinklers on all five properties on Sapeye Lake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each cabin had at least two sprinklers on each roof and additional units on the ground to cover other out-buildings with heavy plastic sheets around portions of the cabins to prevent sparks from blowing underneath. Propane tanks and any flammable objects had been moved away from the main structures.</p><p>While I was there, a water pump was started and the system tested to see how water was being dispersed around the critical structures. I stayed for three days cleaning up around the cabin and witnessed the usual wind pattern:a slight breeze coming from the north for a couple of hours with much stronger wind blowing from the south starting around 10 in the morning, and often blowing until the early afternoon. Each night there was very little wind until early the next morning as described above.</p><p>Firefighters were facing the worst case scenario:two fires on steep, heavily timbered areas reasonably close to water but with persistent winds during the day which often lead to smoke which restricted the use of helicopter bucketing and use of air tankers.</p><p>When I returned home, I started some research about what was being done to take advantage of the cooler, calmer nights. Unfortunately, most of the stories were about the danger of drones used by irresponsible people which were interfering with firefighting efforts but fortunately there were some promising stories.</p><p>Drones, also called Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV), were usually larger and required to be registered and in most cases required a lot of training before the users were able to use them around other aircraft.</p><p>The majority of uses around wildfires were for mapping and sensing of hot spots to aid ground crews to deal with potential fire repeats.</p><p>As reported in CIRA news, one of the most interesting stories was about a company called Hummingbird Drones which was started by people who had been using helicopters to detect the hot spots.</p><p>They described this work as being fairly inefficient and really, really dangerous because in order to find those hot spots, the helicopter has to fly at a hazardous altitude known as the \u201cdead man zone\u201d as well as taking a machine away from fighting fires.</p><p>The founders\u2019 unique education and job experience led to the development of Hummingbird Drones, a lifesaving business that uses drone tech-nology to find wildfire hot spots as well as some search and rescue work.</p><p>Hummingbird Drones now has six employees and uses five unmanned vehicles to collect data formerly acquired by humans. As with many other stories about UAVs, most of the work is done at night which doesn\u2019t interfere with other aircraft. They have recently done some work in the Cariboo-Chilcotin.</p><p>There are also some interesting tests being done on using UAVs to deliver water and retardant to the very early stages of wildfires while they are still relatively small.</p><p>The critical use of this system is to get on site quickly so the fire could be quickly mapped and start applying water precisely using thermal sensors which could be done continuously day and night regardless of smoke levels.</p><p>The theory is to use many drones because of the much more limited payload but keep them working much longer than the helicopters.</p><p>In a future article we will look at some of the options being considered.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20231004PSCA0003916866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699X-Y5Y1-JD2C-J2V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Almost two-thirds of the burned area is in British Columbia.</p><p>Comparatively, fire activity in 2024 is a fraction of what happened during the worst fire season on record last year. By this time in 2023, nearly 2,500 fires had burned more than 46,000 square kilometres of land. Alberta and Quebec accounted for almost half the fire activity in May and June 2023.</p><p>The total area burned is also below the 10-year average of 7,700 square kilometres but above the 25-year average of 4,650 square kilometres.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the risk is still high for things to get worse this summer.</p><p>\u201cThe planet is burning up and climate change is indeed a significant factor,\u201d Wilkinson said at a news conference.</p><p>Globally there have been 12 straight months with record-breaking average temperatures, and Environment Canada reported that this year just smashed records for the warmest winter this country has ever seen. And 2023 was the second-warmest year on record in Canada, with a national average temperature 2.8 C above average.</p><p>Wilkinson said this summer\u2019s forecast is calling for higher than average temperatures almost everywhere and lower than average rainfall in multiple places.</p><p>One of the maps provided with the forecast is almost jaw-dropping:a deep red shade that predicts a nearly 100 per cent likelihood of above-average temperatures is painted across all of Atlantic Canada and Quebec, most of Ontario and large swaths of Manitoba and Nunavut.</p><p>The forecast said the risk of fires in June is extreme or very high in southern and northeastern B.C. , northern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, a small pocket of northern Manitoba and most of Northwest Territories.</p><p>While the risk is lower in Ontario and Quebec, there is still a likelihood for more fires than usual in both provinces.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PONNWS-news20240626PRSA0004456040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PONNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBN-6BS1-F0HF-80G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459606</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"381\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Here's CTV's Atlantic bureau chief Creeson Agecoutay.</p><p>CREESON AGECOUTAY (Reporter): Two wildfires burning in the central region of Newfoundland, at a combined size of more than 16,000 hectares, is the largest the province has seen in more than six decades.</p><p>BARRY MANUEL (Grand Falls-Windsor Mayor): It's a huge massive fire, and something that we are taking very seriously obviously. You always have to look at the worst case scenario.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: A provincial fire ban is now in place, with four regions under a state of emergency due to the decrease in air quality. Nearby residents are being asked to prepare for an evacuation if the fires grow, while those most vulnerable to smoke are already being evacuated by bus and air as a precaution.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I got COPD and night before last I smelled smoke in my apartment.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: The fires have closed the only highway for some of Newfoundland's southern communities, with some grocery shelves running low in Harbor Breton.</p><p>ROY DRAKE (Harbour Breton Mayor): A couple of days without a road is not bad, you can manage. But once you get into day four and five, and you're not sure when it's going to open up again, then that makes people a bit more stressed.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: The province is now sending a ferry to bring in much needed essential supplies and fuel, along with additional help.</p><p>DRAKE: We're going to be using coastguard helicopters from what I'm being told to bring supplies over from the Burin Peninsula.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: The large plumes of smoke have made it difficult for water bombers to put out the fires, but today crews were met with some good news.</p><p>JEFF MOTTY (Provincial Forest Fire Deputy Officer): The winds were in our favour today, so with the winds coming from the north, blowing southwards, it was blowing smoke away from the communities.</p><p>AGECOUTAY: Rain is also expected to help with the dry conditions that have been fueling the fire. Environment experts suspect the fire started more than two weeks ago from a lightning strike during a dryer than usual summer. The province believes that it could take weeks or even months to put the fires out.

Peebles pointed out that a forest fire situation in the northeast diverted recreation traffic from the Alaska Highway to the Stewart-Cassiar route (Highway 37), bringing more travellers through the Lakes District.</p><p>Comparing visitor numbers, Peebles mentioned that this year is nearly on par with 2023. From April to June, the VIC saw 608 visitors, just a slight decrease from the 613 in the same period last year.</p><p>The peak season from June to September last year drew 1,062 visitors, boosted by Burns Lake\u2019s 100th anniversary celebrations which attracted approximately 2,500 more people.</p><p>Visitors to Burns Lake are primarily from Lower Mainland BC, the United States, Europe, and Australia. At the VIC, tourists often inquire about camping, mountain biking at Kager Lake and Boer Mountain, local history, and nearby attractions.</p><p>New additions like the Magee House Bed \u2018n\u2019 Breakfast and enhancements to the Rod Reid Trail system have been popular this year. The VIC offers e-bike rentals, ideal for exploring the town or as a pit stop while charging electric vehicles.</p><p>Peebles said many visitors are also excited about the free campground beside placid Burns Lake alongside Radley Beach.</p><p>Speaking about\u00a0ongoing tourism efforts, Peebles highlighted several efforts by the local government to attract and enhance tourism, which includes setting up\u00a0new amenities at VIC. A self-serve kayakomat at Radley Beach, facilitates\u00a0easy kayak rentals for exploring local lakes and scenic routes. Additionally, VIC also offers e-bike rentals and an EV charging unit for visitors to access. Tourism ambassadors also provide updates on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, enhancing visitor engagement with the area's attractions.</p><p>Looking ahead, Burns Lake plans to expand its tourism offerings, including developing First Nations history attractions, establishing year-round farmers' markets, and utilizing recently acquired recreation lands.</p><p>\"The whole tourism game within easy reach of downtown is about to get enhanced in a year-round fashion,\" Peebles said.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Burns Lake Lakes District News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURNSL-news20240705PLD4619295</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURNSL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CDN-KNT1-F0HF-80MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438230</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Poor air quality will persist into the weekend.</p><p>NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE</p><p>According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.</p><p>If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.</p><p>Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.</p><p>To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm.</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20230607TMPC2023060768125352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DS-C1J1-F197-54S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Poor air quality may persist into Saturday for some areas. <br/><br/> NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE<br/><br/> According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.<br/><br/> To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060868136104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-JBN1-JDV5-F0G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

JOHN'S, N.L. - Crews are building fire lines and using industrial sprinklers to protect a central Labrador town from wildfires, though a thunderstorm temporarily halted a fleet of water bombers on Monday.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador forest fire duty officer Mark Lawlor says the majority of the firefighting focus in the area is on two fires burning west of Churchill Falls, one 17 kilometres and the other seven kilometres from the town.</p><p>Lawlor says the fires in both areas are still smouldering and trees are still bursting into flames, but there is rain in the forecast for Wednesday.</p><p>He says the blaze closest to Churchill Falls advanced by about a half-a-kilometre Monday, but not in the direction of the community, which is home to massive hydroelectric plant that serves Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec.</p><p>He says there are more than 60 industrial sprinklers set up along one side of the town to protect it if the fire jumps across the Churchill River, which is in between the flames and the community.</p><p>Lawlor says Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro has also made headway removing trees and brush to create a fire line on the west side of the town.</p><p>\"Today is good. Our fire behavior analyst has reduced his prediction on fire behavior, we expect to see less fire behavior there today,\" Lawlor said Monday about the weather conditions.</p><p>\"Tomorrow, we could see some increased fire behavior, given the increased temperature and higher wind.\"</p><p>The rain forecast for Wednesday, if it comes, \"will certainly be a big help,\" he added.</p><p>Water bombers had to stand down Monday because of a passing thunderstorm, and they flew back east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay to wait out the weather, Lawlor said. However, helicopters were able to quickly resume dumping water on the fires once the storm passed.</p><p>About 750 residents and workers were evacuated from Churchill Falls last week because of the nearby wildfire. Officials have not yet said when they might be able to return home.</p><p>The provincial wildfire dashboard on Monday afternoon showed nine wildfires burning in Labrador and one on the island of Newfoundland. Seven were out of control, including the fire closest to Churchill Falls. Two \u2014 one in Labrador and one in Newfoundland \u2014 were under control, and the remaining blaze, which was about 17 kilometres from Churchill Falls, was \"being held,\" which means it is no longer spreading.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 24, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f8f307dbe80448d68d014d94052d52c4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBC-B481-DY9S-T0VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><timeReceived>05:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 24, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Margaret Evans is near that border tonight.<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):</p><p><br/>First responders shifting into action at a fire station in northern Israel. Their work these days, mostly fighting fires that can start from missiles, fired by Hezbollah in Lebanon and landing in dry forest. Fire chief Jorge Buniak is letting us ride along.<br/><br/>JORGE BUINIAK (FIRE CHIEF):<br/>We're going right now where, where is missiles.<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):<br/>Whatever it is that's come down has done so in a closed military zone, and we're out of the chase. We catch up later in a patch of scorched wood, burnt after a missile landed three weeks ago.<br/><br/>JORGE BUINIAK (FIRE CHIEF):<br/>Lebanon is there behind the mountains. This is Lebanon.<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):<br/>And you say that's about four or five kilometres?<br/><br/>JORGE BUINIAK (FIRE CHIEF):<br/>Five kilometre.<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):<br/>He tells us the earlier alert was a Hezbollah drone that exploded or was exploded. An Israeli soldier apparently injured. As the cross-border attacks increase on both directions so too does the rhetoric from both sides. The fear is the situation here is so tense it could easily escalate into a full-on regional war. Tens of thousands of people living along both sides of the border have already been displaced for months. Bus driver Avi Avraham has been living in a hotel for seven months now. A great view, but not home. Home is Kiryat Shmona, where a missile hit his house.<br/><br/>AVI AVRAHAM (BUS DRIVER):<br/>(Speaking foreign language).<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):<br/>He says he's hoping for a peace agreement, not a war. Yaakov Naftali prefers military action.<br/><br/>YAAKOV NAFTALI (RESIDENT OF NORTHERN ISRAEL):<br/>(Speaking foreign language).<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):<br/>'A political solution could give us quiet for a year, two years maybe,' he says, 'but the problem would return.' Even if Israel were to launch a ground offensive in southern Lebanon as some Israelis have advocated, analysts say it wouldn't guarantee safety for Israel's north.<br/><br/>OFER SHELAH (INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES):<br/>The problem is once again, as it is in Gaza, what are you trying to achieve? What is the, the end state that you want to achieve? And I don't think we'll be able to reach a stable end state by military means.<br/><br/>MARGARET EVANS (REPORTER):<br/>It's hard to not see the forest when you've lost so many trees.

'After reviewing the situation, we had to retreat to standby because it is on a mountaintop,' Bancha said late Wednesday night.</p><p>At least ten firefighting vehicles were dispatched to fight the fire, and they were joined Thursday afternoon by at least two helicopters, which surveyed the situation and dropped water.</p><p>Initially, efforts to put out the fire focused on building firebreaks.</p><p>According to Coconuts Bangkok, Bancha stated that the fire could be brought under control in five days but that he would try to do so in three.</p><p>Other forest fires have erupted in provinces further north in recent days as seasonal temperatures rise, a recurring issue that contributes to dangerously high levels of air pollution.</p><p>By noon Thursday, the fire had burned about 700 rai (about 275 acres, or 112 hectares) of forest in Nakhon Nayok, according to Bancha.</p><p>The fire started on a high point of Khao Chaplu mountain and spread to the neighbouring Khao Laem mountain. According to local media, it burned easily because much of the vegetation was bamboo, and high winds fanned the flames.</p><p>The mountains are located on a large plot of land near one of Thailand's most well-known nature reserves, Khao Yai National Park. The Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, Thailand's version of West Point, is close to where the fire started, and a village of about 500 people is about 1 kilometre (half a mile) away, according to Thai Rath. Residents were warned to notify authorities if they saw any wild animals fleeing the burning forest.</p><p>According to government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha was closely monitoring the situation and had ordered officials and the army to mobilize to stop the fire's spread.</p><p>He went on to say that Prayuth had directed officials to keep an eye out for anyone deliberately lighting fires to clear land for farming or other purposes, a practice that has been blamed for previous fires. The cause of the fire in Nakhon Nayok was unknown, though some local media reports suggested it was caused by lightning.</p><p>According to Bancha, a storm on Tuesday ignited a fire nearby, and strong winds blew to the Khao Laem area.</p><p>Separate forest fires have been raging further north, according to Anucha, including in Chiang Mai province, where water was dumped from the sky Wednesday in an attempt to put out the flames.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES31032023000513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67X6-MRK1-F00C-61GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 31, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

Department of Natural Resources fire crews responded to a forest fire in Howard Brook, a heavily wooded area northeast of Hartland, Sunday evening, Oct. 23.  Hartland Fire Chief Mike Walton said his department responded to the fire report at approximately 8 p.m. Sunday. He said they could see the fire from the highway but couldn\u2019t reach the blaze burning on \u201cthe backside of the brook.\u201d Walton said there are no roads, not even four-wheeler roads, into the burning area. He said his crews monitored the situation until Department of Natural Resources fire crews arrived before midnight.  Walton estimated the fire covered an approximately 10-acre area. He believes the fallen leaves are fuelling the fire.  The Hartland fire chief said forest fires are rare in late October.  Nick Brown, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development, said staff responded to the fire Saturday evening.  \u201cThe fire started last night (Oct. 23) in the Howard Brook area and is now listed as under control,\u201d Brown stated in an email.  Staff remained working at the site on Monday to ensure it remained under contorl.   \u201cThe fire is estimated to be eight hectares in size, and the fire is only burning surface fuels such as dead leaves. (So. no actual trees burning),\u201d Brown added.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-28c98620afea488ebe74cb19b4a1c4c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66PR-2GP1-JBVR-323N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"218\"/><timeReceived>03:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 25, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in?

Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Related Stories</p><p>Muskoka Fire Danger Rating 2023</p><p>Restricted Fire Zone order in effect June 1 for Muskoka, Parry Sound, Almaguin</p><p>Are you prepared in case of a wildfire Parry Sound-Muskoka?</p><p>UPDATE: 2 forest fires burning in Algonquin Park; one almost doubles in size</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>The city's most recent report shows 82,000 speeding tickets were issued through the ASE program between July 5, 2021 and March 31,

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>The city's most recent report shows 82,000 speeding tickets were issued through the ASE program between July 5, 2021 and March 31,

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>The city's most recent report shows 82,000 speeding tickets were issued through the ASE program between July 5, 2021 and March 31,

During the past three decades, the average number of forest fires has been about 1,000 fires annually, with an average burnt area of 0.5 ha per fire.</p><p>Longtime wildfire ecologist Robert Gray has been telling us for some time we need to make some changes to our forest practices including more thinning and prescribed burns at low fire intensity.</p><p>Some people in the forest industry are also promoting some changes to our harvesting practices.</p><p>Ian Kerr, owner of West Kootenays, B.C.-based AcreShakerr Contracting, thinks it is important to incentivize pre-commercial thinning, first and second pass thinning, and good stewardship.</p><p>An article in Canadian Forest Industry by Ellen Cools describes how Keer has been transitioning to smaller harvesting equipment that causes less damage during his commercial thinning oper-ations. His purchase of a F4 Dion forwarder from Michel Dion, based in St. Augustin-de-Martins, Quebec has allowed him to change everything in terms of not having to build any block roads or trails, or construct landings, and being able to have very dense tree retention without any residual damage.</p><p>\u201cThe forwarder on rubber tracks, very small \u2013 six feet wide, 28 feet long \u2013 can haul either cord wood or short logs (16-to 18-foot ) which meet cut-tolength requirements for local sawmills. The forwarder is so small it can move between trees easily. The F4 Dion has a rubber track with an iron cleat, similar to a snowcat, but smoother, with only one point of contact for traction. As a result, it\u2019s very light on the ground and does not squash the root maps in the forest.\u201d</p><p>Cariboo forestry expert Ken Day says more forest thinning is needed which involves removing trees and other vegetation that is dead or slow-growing to make room for new trees and to remove wildfire fuel from the area.</p><p>He goes on to compare us with traditional European forestry practices. They often thin their forests twice when the forest is 15 years old or three times at age 30.</p><p>Sometimes, they even thin forests once more at age 60 and then, when the forest is 80 years old, harvest it. Each of those thinnings puts some fibre into the market as a means of improving the quality of the final harvest and recovering fibre in the interim while the stand is growing.</p><p>Jim Hilton is a Cariboo-based professional forester</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TERSTN-news20230824PSWA0003820312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TERSTN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691D-3P41-JD2C-J1PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438220</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

As an independent, I will call for a massive increase in funding for the beds that are needed. But more importantly, I will bring awareness to what we\u2019re calling for recovery as the means to stop these preventable deaths.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have to also address the reality that over 90 per cent of the people that enter recovery are going to relapse. It\u2019s a normal component of the disease of addiction. And when relapse occurs, we send those that suffer from that disease back to organized crime, as they have nowhere else to go. If they were an alcoholic, they would have the opportunity to go to a beer, wine, or government liquor store to get what they need that day, and they would have another opportunity to try again.</p><p>Our son was in recovery for eight months, and you don\u2019t stay in recovery for eight months if it isn\u2019t something you want in your life. And when Ryan relapsed on his job site, he was going back to work as a third-year electrician and he died during his lunch break. Our federal drug policy, the prohibition of drugs, gave Ryan nowhere else to go but back to organized crime.</p><p>And I think all of our provincial parties are ignoring this, and it\u2019s disgusting that they are allowing these people to die a preventable death. And they are not acknowledging the 150 youth, the vast majority that were not addicted, our first-time recreational youth.</p><p>Users who are not addicted are not going to recovery but are going to die. It\u2019s like these people don\u2019t exist to them and it\u2019s not being acknowledged.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive for in helping the province and Island hit those goals? As an Independent, I will be supporting policy that acknowledges climate change is real, and hard choices will have to be made not only to address the issues of today, but for our future generations. And as an Independent, I support policy, whether it comes from the left or the right.</p><p>If it\u2019s policy that is evidence-based I support that it needs to represent the best interests of all British Columbians, and we will have to do more than we are doing today, and the fires that we see every year only increase.</p><p>While there has been an increase in rental housing construction in the Comox Valley, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock here? If there are policy ideas from all parties that address the issue that we have in the Comox Valley (we have to look at them.) I think we have to look at the roles that our municipalities, regional districts, province, play in driving up the cost through red tape policy and delays for permits.</p><p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s accountability enough for these organizations and levels of government that also add to our increase in the cost of housing. So we need to address that as well.</p><p>The area around the Connect Centre in Courtenay continues to face issues and there have been reported increases of crime in the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposed Braidwood Complex aims to address these issues but has faced pushback from some neighbours. Do you agree with the Braidwood Complex and its location, and how will you aim to make it work effectively? If not, how will you address these issues in its absence? I absolutely support it desperately, and there will always be pushback, it doesn\u2019t matter where it will be.</p><p>It is going to help for sure. But once again, we\u2019re not address-ing the pushback and the issues that are causing the chaos and the unpredictability of people who suffer from addiction and mental health issues. All forms of government and all parties are not acknowledging that the toxicity in drugs has changed dramatically-it\u2019s not what it was 10 years ago.</p><p>Users today are in endless cycles of detox and sickness. It\u2019s just not talked about that the number of people that are knocked unconscious \u2026 and now have permanent brain damage and come back out into the community severely mental health issues and are using drugs on top of it.</p><p>We want to put little band aids and we want to fund more beds and build more mental institutions. But we still are going to allow organized crime to fill the mental health and addiction of people who are affected. And we are always going to have mental health issues and we are always going to have addiction issues.</p><p>It\u2019s the toxicity in the drugs that has changed. And once again, how would our alcohol users who are functioning alcoholics who own businesses, pay rent, have jobs, have families, contribute to our community if organized crime was still making the alcohol? Because it wouldn\u2019t be blind drunk, it would be dead drunk and we would have chaos like we\u2019ve never seen. But we don\u2019t acknowledge that we give our alcohol users a safe, legal source to go to. And until we address our substance users, we\u2019re just putting beds and we\u2019re not dealing with the issues \u2026 it\u2019s not going to change much.</p><p>School District 71 has policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit SD71\u2019s ability to use these policies and resources? No, I would support all policies and funding to support inclusive environments for our students.

I just can't imagine having to do that\u2026 because you can't get your cat or something like that. But if you can catch the cat, bring it to me for however long you need. I'll do that for them.\"</p><p>She said, she feels pretty secure where she is and has taken fire mitigation measures including having fire fighting equipment on hand.</p><p>Goodenough knows it is difficult to travel with cats because most hotels won't take them.

The legislation lays down a road map for how the federal government plans to get there.

The federal government has finalized all of its deals with municipalities through the $4-billion housing accelerator fund.

More than half of the cases in Quebec are in the Montreal area, while one case in Ontario has been linked to a high school.

He said flares and fireworks were found in Mondaca's vehicle.</p><p>The other suspect was identified as Franco Pinto, a former employee of the National Forest Corporation. He is accused of planning the crime.</p><p>The regional prosecutor for Valparaiso, Claudia Perivancich, said investigators have evidence the two men agreed \u201cin advance to carry out conduct of this type when the weather conditions were adequate.\u201d</p><p>Prosecutors said there was an economic motive behind the plot, that is providing more work in fighting fires. They said they had not ruled out the possibility of more people being involved.</p><p>The commander of the Valparaiso Fire Department, Vicente Maggiolo, said, \u201cWe are very dismayed by the situation.\" </p><p>Maggiolo called it an isolated incident and said it should not tarnish the work of the fire department. \u201cWe have been saving lives for more than 170 years,\u201d he told TVN.</p><p>Christian Little, executive director of the forestry department, described the detention of a former official as \u201ca pain\u201d for the agency.</p><p>Both the fire department and forestry agency said they would tighten hiring procedures.</p><p>The megafire began Feb. 2 in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas nature reserve, in the central region of Chile, and for several days burned several communes, including destroying more than 10,000 homes. It is considered Chile's worst tragedy since a magnitude 8.8 earthquake killed more than 500 people on Feb. 27, 2010.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ab431b293fe71d9c0e5b0381778b8ffc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C40-6471-DY9S-T23W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><timeReceived>09:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 25, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says there were 120 active fires burning on Tuesday, including 46 that were out of control.</p><p>As of this week, more than 1,480 fires have burned about 5,200 square kilometres, an area almost as large as all of Prince Edward Island. Almost two-thirds of the burned area is in British Columbia.</p><p>Comparatively, fire activity in 2024 is a fraction of what happened during the worst fire season on record last year. By this time in 2023, nearly 2,500 fires had burned more than 46,000 square kilometres of land. Alberta and Quebec accounted for almost half the fire activity in May and June 2023.</p><p>The total area burned is also below the 10-year average of 7,700 square kilometres but above the 25-year average of 4,650 square kilometres.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the risk is still high for things to get worse this summer.</p><p>\u201cThe planet is burning up and climate change is indeed a significant factor,\u201d Wilkinson said at a news conference.</p><p>Globally there have been 12 straight months with record-breaking average temperatures, and Environment Canada reported that this year just smashed records for the warmest winter this country has ever seen. And 2023 was the second-warmest year on record in Canada, with a national average temperature 2.8 C above average.</p><p>Wilkinson said this summer\u2019s forecast is calling for higher than average temperatures almost everywhere and lower than average rainfall in multiple places.</p><p>One of the maps provided with the forecast is almost jaw-dropping:a deep red shade that predicts a nearly 100 per cent likelihood of above-average temperatures is painted across all of Atlantic Canada and Quebec, most of Ontario and large swaths of Manitoba and Nunavut.</p><p>The forecast said the risk of fires in June is extreme or very high in southern and northeastern B.C. , northern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, a small pocket of northern Manitoba and most of Northwest Territories.</p><p>While the risk is lower in Ontario and Quebec, there is still a likelihood for more fires than usual in both provinces.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20240613RDA0004430124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C7W-K6G1-JD2C-J16H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

But more importantly, I will bring awareness to what we're calling for recovery as the means to stop these preventable deaths.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have to also address the reality that over 90 per cent of the people that enter recovery are going to relapse. It's a normal component of the disease of addiction. And when relapse occurs, we send those that suffer from that disease back to organized crime,\u00a0as they have nowhere else to go. If they were an alcoholic, they would have the opportunity to go to a beer, wine, or government liquor store to get\u00a0what they need that day, and they would have another opportunity to try again.</p><p>Our son was in recovery for eight months, and you don't stay in recovery for eight months if it isn't something you want in your life. And when Ryan relapsed on his job site, he was going back to work as a third-year electrician and he died during his lunch break.\u00a0Our federal drug policy, the prohibition of drugs, gave Ryan nowhere else to go but back to organized crime.</p><p>And I think all of our provincial parties are ignoring this,\u00a0and it's disgusting that they are allowing these people to die a preventable death. And they are not acknowledging the 150 youth, the vast majority that were not addicted, our first-time recreational youth.</p><p>Users who are not addicted are not going to recovery but are going to die. It's like these people don't exist to them and it's not being acknowledged.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive for in helping the province and Island hit those goals?</p><p>As an Independent,\u00a0I will be supporting policy that acknowledges climate change is real, and hard choices will have to be made not only to address the issues of today, but for our future generations. And as an Independent, I support policy, whether it comes from the left or the right.</p><p>If it's policy that is evidence-based I support that\u00a0it needs to represent the best interests of all British Columbians, and we will have to do more than we are doing today, and the fires that we see every year only increase.</p><p>While there has been an increase in rental housing construction in the Comox Valley, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock here?</p><p>If there are\u00a0policy ideas from all parties that address the issue that we have in the Comox Valley (we have to look at them.)\u00a0I think we have to look at the roles that our municipalities, regional districts, province,\u00a0play in driving up the cost through red tape policy and delays for permits.</p><p>I don't think there's accountability enough for these organizations and levels of government that also add to our increase \u00a0in the cost of housing. So\u00a0we need to address that as well.</p><p>The area around the Connect Centre in Courtenay continues to face issues and there have been reported increases of crime in the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposed Braidwood Complex aims to address these issues but has faced pushback from some neighbours. Do you agree with the Braidwood Complex and its location, and how will you aim to make it work effectively? If not, how will you address these issues in its absence?</p><p>I absolutely support it desperately, and there will always be pushback, it doesn't matter where it will be.</p><p>It is going to help for sure. But once again, we're not addressing\u00a0the pushback\u00a0and the issues that\u00a0are causing the chaos and the unpredictability of people who suffer from addiction and mental health issues. All forms of government and all parties are not acknowledging\u00a0that the toxicity in drugs has changed dramatically - it's not what it was 10 years ago.</p><p>Users today are in endless cycles of detox and sickness. \u00a0It's just not talked about that the number of people that are knocked unconscious \u2026\u00a0 and now have permanent brain damage and come back out into the community severely mental health issues and are using drugs on top of it.</p><p>We want to put little band aids and we\u00a0want to fund more beds and build more mental institutions. But we still are going to allow organized crime to fill the mental health and addiction of people\u00a0who are affected. And we are always going to have mental health issues and we are always going to have addiction issues.</p><p>It's the toxicity in the drugs that has changed. And once again, how would our alcohol users who are functioning alcoholics who own businesses, pay rent, have jobs, have families, contribute to our community if organized crime was still making the alcohol?</p><p>Because it wouldn't be blind drunk, it would be dead drunk and we would have\u00a0chaos like we've never seen. But we don't acknowledge that we give our alcohol users a safe, legal source to go to. And until we address our substance users,\u00a0we're just putting beds and we're not dealing with the issues \u2026\u00a0it's not going to change much.</p><p>School District 71 has policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit SD71\u2019s ability to use these policies and resources?</p><p>No, I would support all policies and funding to support inclusive environments for our students. \u00a0I would also call out any party candidate or leader of a party that did not support inclusion, SOGI, and truth and\u00a0reconciliation.</p><p>We need to include reducing class size, increasing EAs (and) learning supports, teachers\u00a0and counsellors. I would also advocate for class composition to be factored into policy and support.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Comox Valley Record</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20241004PCV4651391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D40-84N1-JD2C-J3RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

CTV's Sarah Plowman has the details.</p><p>SARAH PLOWMAN (Reporter): In the battle against Labrador's wildfires, rain is helping. So are these water bombers from Quebec and Ontario, doubling the fleet in this fight. Today the fire raging near Churchill Falls didn't move.</p><p>MARK LAWLOR (N.L. Provincial Forest Fire Duty Officer): There's still a lot of smoke, some low ground fire. No movement in the fire adjacent to Churchill Falls, and all in all a pretty good day.</p><p>PLOWMAN: Welcome news for evacuees who had 45 minutes to pack Wednesday night. What they don't want is for the fire to cross the Churchill River.</p><p>ROBERT DAWE (Evacuee): So as long as it stays on the other side of that river bank, and when it crosses to this side of river bank, the town is right there, the power plant is right there. So if it crosses at all, it's big trouble for a lot of people.</p><p>PLOWMAN: The town now separated. Most went to Happy Valley, Goose Bay.</p><p>SUSAN CHISLETT (Evacuee): Driving away was a little bit surreal for me because that's home.</p><p>PLOWMAN: Some headed for friends houses, others to a shelter set up in a gym.</p><p>PERRY TRIMPER (Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal MHA): And many families they came to that same centre and adopted a family, and said come stay with me.</p><p>PLOWMAN: Within 24 hours, the shelter was no longer needed. Everyone had a billet, an apartment, or a hotel room.</p><p>ASHLEY BILLARD (Evacuee): It was like, you know, what was that like when you're given such limited time to pack up what you can. The volunteers that created this seamless well-organized reception also only had that three hours and 45 minutes.</p><p>PLOWMAN: A few dozen workers stayed to keep the hydro plant running, generating power for Newfoundland and Labrador, and some parts of Quebec.</p><p>JENNIVER WILLIAMS (CEO N.L. Hydro): How we are feeling about the fire today versus yesterday. I think we're feeling even better today than we did yesterday.</p><p>PLOWMAN: Another wildfire is burning about 17 kilometers from Churchill Falls. Today that one didn't move either, keeping the highway open. At this point, there's no estimate as to when the evacuees can go home.
