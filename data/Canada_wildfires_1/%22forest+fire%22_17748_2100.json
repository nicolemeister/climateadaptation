Hornidge finished school in 1967 and joined his brother Brian at MacMillan Bloedel's Kennedy Lake logging division at Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p><p>He was still working as a logger when the \"War in the Woods\" hit Clayoquot Sound: a series of blockades and protests against clearcutting that drew worldwide mass media attention.</p><p>In Loggerheads, published by Saskatchewan's Endless Sky Books, Hornidge writes from the unique, sometimes humorous and even irreverent point of view of one of the many loggers on the west coast whose forestry careers were cut short on the other side of the demonstrators' picket lines.</p><p>\"For a decade, the issue of forestland use in British Columbia raged like a forest fire,\" Hornidge writes in the opening pages of Loggerheads. \"Starting small, it generated smoke and mirrors and a world media hype that came to hang like a stalled hurricane over a tiny, beautiful corner of the world known as Clayoquot Sound\u2014and the largest act of civil disobedience in Canada to that date.\"</p><p>After more than two decades harvesting, Hornidge says he was \"loggershamed\" as a \"tree-killer\" and faced soul-searing losses of identity and livelihood, part of the human fallout of the inevitable move away from a resource-based economy.</p><p>\"My goal was a story that is truthful, personal, and encompasses many of the issues in this complex problem,\" Hornidge says.\"Three decades after The War of the Woods, we know what happened, and we've been told why. There's a lot we were never told.\"</p><p>Loggerheads received a warm review from Bill Arnott, author of the Gone Viking series and A Season on Vancouver Island. \"Part treatise, part manual, part eco-memoir, Bruce Hornidge's Loggerheads is a timely, timeless read for lovers of trees,\" Arnott says. \"Richly shared in crisp prose, this book stands as a sentinel evergreen to the nature and industry our forests provide.\"</p><p>After losing his job as a logger in 1997, Hornidge became a security guard in Campbell River, Vancouver and Vanderhoof, British Columbia. Bruce and his wife, the Rev. Minnie Hornidge, live in Glen Williams, Ontario. There, Bruce gardens and knits. And writes.</p><p>Hornidge will be back on the west coast of Vancouver Island this week for a few reading events, starting with a stop at Electric Mermaid: Live Reads at Char's Landing in Port Alberni on Wednesday, Oct. 25. The event begins at 6 p.m.</p><p>On Thursday, Oct. 26, Hornidge will be holding a meet and greet plus book signing at Mobius Books on Argyle Street, starting at 10 a.m.</p><p>Hornidge will also head over to Ucluelet on Saturday, Oct. 28 for a reading and signing at the Ucluelet Community Centre from 10 a.m. to noon.</p><p>Loggerheads is available from most bookstores, online and off. It can also be purchased directly from Endless Sky Books or Shadowpaw Press.</p><p>READ ALSO: Long-awaited logging report to shape response to B.C.'s war in the woods</p><p>Copyright 2023 Vancouver Island Free Daily</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-news20231024PVC4529742</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69G6-BPD1-F0HF-80CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Stay calm, be alert, and be prepared.\u201d  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ma made the sobering comments as part of a look-ahead to the forest fire season \u2013 which is already well underway. Officials say almost half a million hectares have been burned by fires to date in 2023 \u2013 the 10-year average by this time of year is only about 20,000 hectares. </p><p>\u201c[It\u2019s] quite alarming to see this amount of area burning this early in the season, and it certainly doesn\u2019t bode well for the remainder of the summer,\u201d said Neal McLoughlin, the superintendent of predictive services for the BC Wildfire Service. </p><p>Officials say several factors are driving their predictions of a record-setting fire season. </p><p>The first is ongoing and sustained heat waves. Officials said 16 BC communities set all-time records for May for hot and dry weather, going back more than a century of record keeping. </p><p>\u201cIt was truly exceptional, and it was the entire month of May, which is typically cool and showery,\u201d said Matt McDonald, the lead fire weather forecaster for the BCWS. \u201c\u2026we\u2019re consistently five, six, eight, even ten degrees warmer than normal \u2026 it accelerated the curing of our forest soils and accelerated the melting of our snowpack in the alpine.\u201d </p><p>Another factor is that much of the province is well into the third year of drought-like conditions, and the water deficit is getting worse. The last 90 days have seen just 58 millimetres of rain fall in most areas of the province \u2013 the average is 115 millimetres. May and June are typically cool and wet in BC, but this year has seen little rainfall to recharge parched soils. That\u2019s pushed the measures of the forest\u2019s readiness to burn far beyond normal. McLoughlin showed a photograph from a recent fire of soil burned to the depth of a hand-axe beneath a tree root.  </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a metre of fuel consumption in the early fire season. This might be typical in a really dry fall, but to see this going up in early May and June is very anomalous,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Also exacerbating the situation, this spring\u2019s heat wave melted the mid- to upper-elevation snowpack faster than usual, increasing the danger of fire starts from lightning (see \u2018Early heatwaves wipe out snowpack at record pace\u2019 on page 4 of this issue). These areas have been made open to ignition three or four weeks earlier than normal, officials said. </p><p>\u201cOnce those fuels are no longer buried in snow, they become receptive to [ignition],\u201d said McDonald. \u201cAs we approach the peak of lightning season, those fuels are ready to be ignited.\u201d  </p><p>All those factors combined mean that firefighters are expecting a busy season across the province, even with the prospect of four or five days of rain expected for this week. They say resources are likely to be stretched to the limit \u2013 and with the same conditions in place across the country, there may not be a lot of outside help forthcoming.  </p><p>\u201cAll agencies across Canada are busy this year, and there is a real shortage of resources for sharing,\u201d said McLoughlin. \u201cThis is a year where we will have to dig deep and use the resources we have here in BC to address our situation.\u201d </p><p>Officials couldn\u2019t say if this was going to be the worst fire season ever seen in the province \u2013 but they\u2019re certain it will compare to some of the worst. </p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be going out on a limb to say it\u2019s been one of the most challenging wildfire seasons to date\u2026 the numbers that represent that,\u201d said Cliff Chapman, director of BCWS operations. </p><p>\u201cBritish Columbians, BC Wildfire Service, First Nations communities, we all have to be prepared that this season will be very challenging, or has the potential to be.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7b2d96fae1c34521ae9bf39b02e7751f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GD-7Y11-JBVR-34PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><timeReceived>01:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 15, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Hornidge finished school in 1967 and joined his brother Brian at MacMillan Bloedel's Kennedy Lake logging division at Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p><p>He was still working as a logger when the \"War in the Woods\" hit Clayoquot Sound: a series of blockades and protests against clearcutting that drew worldwide mass media attention.</p><p>In Loggerheads, published by Saskatchewan's Endless Sky Books, Hornidge writes from the unique, sometimes humorous and even irreverent point of view of one of the many loggers on the west coast whose forestry careers were cut short on the other side of the demonstrators' picket lines.</p><p>\"For a decade, the issue of forestland use in British Columbia raged like a forest fire,\" Hornidge writes in the opening pages of Loggerheads. \"Starting small, it generated smoke and mirrors and a world media hype that came to hang like a stalled hurricane over a tiny, beautiful corner of the world known as Clayoquot Sound\u2014and the largest act of civil disobedience in Canada to that date.\"</p><p>After more than two decades harvesting, Hornidge says he was \"loggershamed\" as a \"tree-killer\" and faced soul-searing losses of identity and livelihood, part of the human fallout of the inevitable move away from a resource-based economy.</p><p>\"My goal was a story that is truthful, personal, and encompasses many of the issues in this complex problem,\" Hornidge says.\"Three decades after The War of the Woods, we know what happened, and we've been told why. There's a lot we were never told.\"</p><p>Loggerheads received a warm review from Bill Arnott, author of the Gone Viking series and A Season on Vancouver Island. \"Part treatise, part manual, part eco-memoir, Bruce Hornidge's Loggerheads is a timely, timeless read for lovers of trees,\" Arnott says. \"Richly shared in crisp prose, this book stands as a sentinel evergreen to the nature and industry our forests provide.\"</p><p>After losing his job as a logger in 1997, Hornidge became a security guard in Campbell River, Vancouver and Vanderhoof, British Columbia. Bruce and his wife, the Rev. Minnie Hornidge, live in Glen Williams, Ontario. There, Bruce gardens and knits. And writes.</p><p>Hornidge will be back on the west coast of Vancouver Island this week for a few reading events, starting with a stop at Electric Mermaid: Live Reads at Char's Landing in Port Alberni on Wednesday, Oct. 25.

That's nice.\"</p><p>The technical definition of a \"white Christmas,\" said Phillips, is two centimetres of snow that actually sticks around.</p><p>\"That's the Canadian standard. Millions of Canadians won't have one.\"</p><p>Calgary's few scruffy patches of crust are awaiting their fate in the face of forecasts for well-above-freezing temperatures and warm chinook winds. Ottawa, where big dumps are common, lawns are covered with an icy powder that won't do for sledding or snowballs \u2014 but at least sparkles nicely in the sunlight.</p><p>In Montreal, toboggan runs off Mount Royal are closed, and heavy rain and mild temperatures have closed skating rinks.</p><p>After two white Christmases in a row, Vancouver is almost certain to end its streak this year.</p><p>Cypress Mountain north of Vancouver said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that it had to close on Tuesday \"due to inclement weather,\" with high temperatures forecasted to reach 9 C on Friday and sunny weather expected throughout the weekend before rain returns on Christmas Day.</p><p>It's the same everywhere you look.</p><p>From Prince Rupert, B.C., to Cornerbrook, N.L., and from Inuvik in the Northwest Territories to Iqaluit in Nunavut, snow packs at the end of November were between 10 and 15 centimetres below average. Some places, such as southeastern B.C., are 50 centimetres short of average.</p><p>That means that southern Canada is almost without any appreciable snowpack at all.</p><p>Environment Canada's snow map uses brown dots to show snowless stations and it's brown from coast to coast. Edmonton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax \u2014 all brown dots.</p><p>Skiers are keeping their good skis in the closet. Online ski reports suggest 41 resorts across the country have opened an average of only one-third of their runs.</p><p>If you want snow, you have three choices \u2014 the Newfoundland coast along St. John's, Quebec's Saguenay region and a tiny pocket of the Rockies in deep southwest Alberta. All have 15 to 20 centimetres more than average \u2014 not epic, but enough to roll a snowman or slide down a hill.</p><p>\"The snow hasn't had a chance to collect,\" said Phillips.</p><p>\"It's just been too warm and too dry. We've been setting all kinds of records for warm temperatures and that's been the situation for all the summer and certainly into October and November.\"</p><p>Phillips is already concerned about the effect of the dry weather on next year's crops and forests.</p><p>\"Moisture is very concerning on the Prairies,\" he said.</p><p>\"Last year's forest fire conditions started because of winter conditions. It's not looking good at a time when we should be recharging the soil moisture.\"</p><p>Almost the entire country is rated \"abnormally dry,\" Environment Canada's five-stage drought map indicates. Some places in southern Alberta are already \"exceptional\" \u2014 the top of the scale.</p><p>Parts of B.C. continue to see extreme drought conditions, with the Peace River and Fort Nelson regions deemed Level 5 \u2013 the highest level of drought activity with \"adverse impacts almost certain,\" the province says.</p><p>El Nino \u2014 a periodic weather system that brings warm weather to much of North America \u2014 is behind part of the strange weather. This year, the system began early and strongly, Phillips said. As well, Arctic air pushing down into southern latitudes hasn't been as cold as normal.</p><p>But it's all taking place in a changing climate that made 2023 the hottest summer around the globe in recorded history.</p><p>\"El Ninos are different now,\" said Phillips. \"This one is taking place in the context of a warming world.\"</p><p>Lenz knows it. She loves the unaccustomed warmth, but can feel its dark side.</p><p>\"Global warming, you can see it happen. It's worrying.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: El Nino-fuelled warm start to winter could change: Weather Network</p><p>READ ALSO: Climate change causing more frequent warm winter temperatures</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20231221PAB4552161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69XM-WB81-JD2C-J3SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

In particular, the Rainy River District has experienced many floods over the last few years, making the importance of being prepared for emergencies greater than ever. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Patrick Briere, Emergency Management Field Officer in the Amethyst Sector, noted that the last flood was in 2022 when the district set records for high water. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWhen something does happen, like a flooding or forest fire, have something in place to help you be prepared, so you're not scrambling at the last minute to try to put things into place,\" he said. </p><p>A few residents were displaced. Although emergencies such as flooding seem to be getting worse each time they come, lots of work is being done to ensure that communities are prepared when the unexpected happens. </p><p>Briere\u2019s new role as field officer for Emergency Management Ontario (EMO) officially began on September 11, 2023, and has been a long time in the works. He has had to withdraw previous applications for the role due to personal emergencies; however, thankfully the opportunity arose again. </p><p>\u201cWith the life changes that I've gone through over the last few years, it was the right opportunity at the right time. And I jumped at it for sure,\u201d he said. </p><p>There are currently two field officers for the northwest region and Briere is one of them. </p><p>He works closely with Field Officer David Rasi who is set up in Thunder Bay. Together, they cover a large geographical area, educating and training the public to ensure communities have safety plans in place. </p><p>\u201cWe go past Marathon, almost up to the Walleye area, then we go to the Manitoba border and we have a good chunk of the Far North. So we have a big geographical area,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid and I are working together and building lots of plans to get our folks up to speed and up to date.\u201d </p><p>As a liaison to all provincial resources available, in case of an emergency, for example a flood or train derailment in Fort Frances, Briere would be in charge of bringing provincial resources to help communities recover. </p><p>Briere is also positioned at a huge advantage being originally based out of Fort Frances. The province can now easily network with emergency management partners in the Kenora-Rainy River Districts, International Falls, and Manitoba too as Briere continues to build relationships with his former network. </p><p>Field officers for the northwest also work with Indigenous partners, unorganized areas, and any communities nearby that may need support. </p><p>\u201cThe biggest piece is the networking and collaboration that I'm able to do and I get to travel around with the communities and help people out with their planning with their emergencies. That's the best part of it,\u201d he said. </p><p>Briere entered the new role prepared with loads of background experience. Working in his own home area, in the Rainy River District and Thunder Bay Districts, also enabled him to continue building many of the relationships gained from his former roles. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made the transition really good, really easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's been awesome so far.\u201d </p><p>Briere served in multiple roles in the Town of Fort Frances. He was originally brought on as a by-law enforcement officer and worked for over 15 years. He also served as co-chair for the Joint Health and Safety Committee and in multiple titles including alternate CAO and emergency information officer for the Emergency Management Control group. </p><p>\u201cI also ended up in the last six to seven years, taking on more of the incident command role with that group, developing our plans, and being the lead on all of them reporting to council,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really gave me good insight into Emergency Management Ontario, and how emergencies run at the provincial level. It's really helped me out in the long run.\u201d </p><p>He is also proud to be part of the Northwest Response Forum as a planning team member. The conference happens every two years, he said, and a fantastic training opportunity for emergency management coordinators across the north to share what has been going on. </p><p>Emergencies happen unexpectedly, and although a lot of recovery work is often led by municipalities, individuals can also ensure they are prepared in case of emergencies. </p><p>\u201cI think the best thing that individuals can do is to have plans for themselves and their families,\u201d Briere said. \u201cHave 72-hour kits prepared and in place. And just just discuss and practice what would they would do in case of a fire or case of a flood. And if their residence became uninhabitable, \u2018where we can go, what would you do, what does that look like?\u2019\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know the last flood was in 2022, and the flood in 2014\u2014we did have displaced residents,\u201d Briere said. \u201cThe biggest key is making sure people are prepared. If people have questions, they can definitely see me around town and they can reach out and ask.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7b4d0ab46e1e44faa50bc43c5573db5f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B1P-HC41-DY9S-T1JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><timeReceived>04:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 4, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001946</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP &amp; DISPLACEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001450</classCode><className>RAIL TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001450</classCode><className>RAIL TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Here's what you need to know.<br/><br/> What are zombie fires?<br/><br/> Fires ignited during the summer have a chance of surviving long into, or through, the winter by slowly feeding on sufficiently dry organic matter deep underground, within large logs or underneath tree roots, said Jennifer Baltzer, a professor and the Canada research chair in forests and global change at Wilfrid Laurier University.<br/><br/> \"They need to be burning deep in the soils or underneath tree roots to be protected and last through the winter,\" she said, noting that a snow covering can also serve to insulate the fire from the cold air above. \"The deeper burning also means that the snow is not melted.\"<br/><br/> As a result of the severe drought that continues to rock B.C. and the Prairie provinces, stores of underground peat - layers of dead plant material, decades to thousands of years old, that are prevalent throughout Canada's boreal forests - have dried to the point they can sustain fires, Baltzer explained.<br/><br/> Adding to this is the exceptionally warm and dry winter felt across Canada, partly as a result of the current El Nino weather pattern, she said.<br/><br/> According to Baltzer, all zombie fires are carry-overs from the previous summer. Given the scope of last year's unprecedented fire season, it's \"understandable\" why we're seeing so many overwintering fires today, a spokesperson for the BC Wildfire Service told the Star.<br/><br/> How many zombie fires are in Canada?<br/><br/> The vast majority of zombie fires this winter are located in B.C., Alberta and the Northwest Territories, largely as a result of the recent drought, said Ellen Whitman, a forest fire research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.<br/><br/> These same regions also have vast stores of peatlands, on top of being an \"an area that was extremely active for fire in 2023,\" she said. This perfect storm of factors has led to the record-breaking numbers we're seeing now.<br/><br/> According to the BC Wildfire Service, there are 90 active zombie fires in the province at this time, \"the majority of which are located within the Prince George Fire Centre,\" it told the Star.<br/><br/> \"All active holdovers are Under Control, meaning suppression efforts have ensured the wildfire will not spread any further,\" the agency continued.<br/><br/> In Alberta, the province's wildfire dashboard notes there are currently 55 active wildfires in the province, including zombie fires.<br/><br/> Earlier in the year, B.C. saw a peak of 106 zombie fires in January, the largest number on record in the province, according to Lori Daniels, a professor of forest ecology and the Koerner Chair in Wildfire Coexistence at the University of British Columbia.<br/><br/> \"In the past, it's normally somewhere between one, maybe two dozen\" zombie fires recorded nation-wide, she explained, adding what we're seeing now is \"highly unusual.\"<br/><br/> What to expect from the 2024 fire season<br/><br/> The danger with zombie fires, according to Daniels, is that they could keep burning long after we think they've been extinguished, only to pop up later and ignite flames of their own when temperatures warm.<br/><br/> \"Here in Western Canada, we're quite concerned,\" she said, pointing to the abnormally warm and dry winter Canada is experiencing.<br/><br/> \"All those above average temperatures have meant that we're not accumulating the snowpack we normally would,\" she continued. This snow would usually melt deep down into the soil, forming a protective buffer from fire. Without it, Western Canada is at greater risk of flames.<br/><br/> All of this has even caused Alberta to declare an early start to their 2024 wildfire season on Tuesday, instead of the usual March 1 start date. In years past, fire season began in May, Daniels recalled. <br/><br/> Whitman said past research suggests it's far less likely for zombie fires to spark greater forest fires than lightning strikes or human activities. That said, past researchers had far fewer zombie fires to work with, she added.<br/><br/> Zombie fires are \"not necessarily going to be this massive contribution to the next (fire season). Rather, it's sort of an indicator of a fire season that starts early and maintains that pressure very extensively throughout the rest of the season,\" Whitman said.<br/><br/> She said a large number of zombie fires is considered a \"harbinger of a bad season ahead.\"<br/><br/> More zombie fires on the horizon as planet warms<br/><br/> All the experts agree that as the planet warms through human-driven climate change, zombie fires - and more intense fire seasons in general - could be upon us.<br/><br/> \"Climate warming and drying is leading to these very large fire years, which then facilitate this overwintering fire activity,\" Baltzer explained. These zombie fires could potentially spark more blazes the following summer, leading to a cycle.<br/><br/> Furthermore, as zombie fires burn through peat, they're releasing great quantities of carbon into the atmosphere that might have otherwise taken centuries to accumulate underground, further exacerbating climate change, Daniels noted.<br/><br/> That's important, considering wildfires can often be Canada's leading source of emissions; in 2023, the record fires released nearly 480 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.<br/><br/> \"The carbon emissions from the wildfires (in 2023) in Canada are estimated to be more than three times all other sectors in Canada that produce greenhouse gases,\" Daniels said.<br/><br/> Canada's forests act as a carbon sink, absorbing some of the greenhouse gases released by other industries, she continued. But since the early 2000s, our forests have released more carbon through fires than they absorbed.<br/><br/> \"Our trees and our forests can no longer keep up with our society,\" she continued, \"and that's a serious, serious problem.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2024022270699959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCY-6601-JDV5-F536-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Here's what you need to know.<br/><br/> What are zombie fires?<br/><br/> Fires ignited during the summer have a chance of surviving long into, or through, the winter by slowly feeding on sufficiently dry organic matter deep underground, within large logs or underneath tree roots, said Jennifer Baltzer, a professor and the Canada research chair in forests and global change at Wilfrid Laurier University.<br/><br/> \"They need to be burning deep in the soils or underneath tree roots to be protected and last through the winter,\" she said, noting that a snow covering can also serve to insulate the fire from the cold air above. \"The deeper burning also means that the snow is not melted.\"<br/><br/> As a result of the severe drought that continues to rock B.C. and the Prairie provinces, stores of underground peat - layers of dead plant material, decades to thousands of years old, that are prevalent throughout Canada's boreal forests - have dried to the point they can sustain fires, Baltzer explained.<br/><br/> Adding to this is the exceptionally warm and dry winter felt across Canada, partly as a result of the current El Nino weather pattern, she said.<br/><br/> According to Baltzer, all zombie fires are carry-overs from the previous summer. Given the scope of last year's unprecedented fire season, it's \"understandable\" why we're seeing so many overwintering fires today, a spokesperson for the BC Wildfire Service told the Star.<br/><br/> How many zombie fires are in Canada?<br/><br/> The vast majority of zombie fires this winter are located in B.C., Alberta and the Northwest Territories, largely as a result of the recent drought, said Ellen Whitman, a forest fire research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.<br/><br/> These same regions also have vast stores of peatlands, on top of being an \"an area that was extremely active for fire in 2023,\" she said. This perfect storm of factors has led to the record-breaking numbers we're seeing now.<br/><br/> According to the BC Wildfire Service, there are 90 active zombie fires in the province at this time, \"the majority of which are located within the Prince George Fire Centre,\" it told the Star.<br/><br/> \"All active holdovers are Under Control, meaning suppression efforts have ensured the wildfire will not spread any further,\" the agency continued.<br/><br/> In Alberta, the province's wildfire dashboard notes there are currently 55 active wildfires in the province, including zombie fires.<br/><br/> Earlier in the year, B.C. saw a peak of 106 zombie fires in January, the largest number on record in the province, according to Lori Daniels, a professor of forest ecology and the Koerner Chair in Wildfire Coexistence at the University of British Columbia.<br/><br/> \"In the past, it's normally somewhere between one, maybe two dozen\" zombie fires recorded nation-wide, she explained, adding what we're seeing now is \"highly unusual.\"<br/><br/> What to expect from the 2024 fire season<br/><br/> The danger with zombie fires, according to Daniels, is that they could keep burning long after we think they've been extinguished, only to pop up later and ignite flames of their own when temperatures warm.<br/><br/> \"Here in Western Canada, we're quite concerned,\" she said, pointing to the abnormally warm and dry winter Canada is experiencing.<br/><br/> \"All those above average temperatures have meant that we're not accumulating the snowpack we normally would,\" she continued. This snow would usually melt deep down into the soil, forming a protective buffer from fire. Without it, Western Canada is at greater risk of flames.<br/><br/> All of this has even caused Alberta to declare an early start to their 2024 wildfire season on Tuesday, instead of the usual March 1 start date. In years past, fire season began in May, Daniels recalled. <br/><br/> Whitman said past research suggests it's far less likely for zombie fires to spark greater forest fires than lightning strikes or human activities. That said, past researchers had far fewer zombie fires to work with, she added.<br/><br/> Zombie fires are \"not necessarily going to be this massive contribution to the next (fire season). Rather, it's sort of an indicator of a fire season that starts early and maintains that pressure very extensively throughout the rest of the season,\" Whitman said.<br/><br/> She said a large number of zombie fires is considered a \"harbinger of a bad season ahead.\"<br/><br/> More zombie fires on the horizon as planet warms<br/><br/> All the experts agree that as the planet warms through human-driven climate change, zombie fires - and more intense fire seasons in general - could be upon us.<br/><br/> \"Climate warming and drying is leading to these very large fire years, which then facilitate this overwintering fire activity,\" Baltzer explained. These zombie fires could potentially spark more blazes the following summer, leading to a cycle.<br/><br/> Furthermore, as zombie fires burn through peat, they're releasing great quantities of carbon into the atmosphere that might have otherwise taken centuries to accumulate underground, further exacerbating climate change, Daniels noted.<br/><br/> That's important, considering wildfires can often be Canada's leading source of emissions; in 2023, the record fires released nearly 480 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.<br/><br/> \"The carbon emissions from the wildfires (in 2023) in Canada are estimated to be more than three times all other sectors in Canada that produce greenhouse gases,\" Daniels said.<br/><br/> Canada's forests act as a carbon sink, absorbing some of the greenhouse gases released by other industries, she continued. But since the early 2000s, our forests have released more carbon through fires than they absorbed.<br/><br/> \"Our trees and our forests can no longer keep up with our society,\" she continued, \"and that's a serious, serious problem.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2024022270700156</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCY-6601-JDV5-F53F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Reporter Sarah Simpson has been combing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake area\u2026</p><p>10 years ago</p><p>\"Fields set to open in Lake Cowichan\" was a headline in the Sept 4, 2013 edition of the Lake Cowichan Gazette.</p><p>\"The store, which will stock items for all your family needs, is in a well known location and even comes with a well known manager. Val [Rajala] spent 29 years working in the building when it was doing business as the Co-op. The staff are excited to be opening the store in Lake Cowichan and look forward to seeing, and serving, all the area residents. As with all new openings, sometimes the best laid plans go awry, so the staff suggest you watch for the 'Now Open' signs to appear on the store later this week.\"</p><p>In other new beginnings of a decade ago, \"New totes coming soon to a curbside near you\" was an Ashley Degraaf headline.</p><p>\"Folks living in the Youbou, Mesachie Lake and Honeymoon Bay areas can expect delivery of a new easy-roller recycling tote as well as a garbage tote this September. It's part of the regional district's new curbside collection program, 'The new blue recycling tote will replace all yellow and blue bags previously used for recycling,' explained superintendent of solid waste operations Jason Adair in a press release. 'Electoral areas currently receiving garbage collection will also receive a new grey tote to be used for garbage.' Under the new program, residents' current services will stay the same, but at a lower annual fee. Curbside bills have already been reduced by between $1 and $11, depending on the electoral area.</p><p>\"'Automated curbside collection systems are in place throughout the province and have been very successful at increasing worker safety, increasing efficiency, and boosting recycling rates by as much as 30%,' Adair said. 'It's a significant step towards achieving our goal of Zero Waste and has the added benefit of lowering current operating costs, as reflected in the user fees.'\"</p><p>25 years ago</p><p>It was dry back then, too. Twenty-five years ago the top headline on the front of the Sept. 9, 1998 Lake News was \"Tinder dry area woods pose major fire hazard\".</p><p>\"There's a real danger of forest fire in the Cowichan Valley, warns Fire Chief Dick Newman. People should be aware that fires have been banned throughout the area.</p><p>\"'A forest fire can get away from you so quickly that it's hard to believe,' said the Chief, who has had a good deal of experience with them. The forests around the Lake are tinder dry. Labour Day weekend, with campsites crowded, was potentially dangerous but the risk will continue until there is substantial rain. Despite the extreme hazard, some people are still lighting fires. Last week Lake Cowichan firemen were called to a big campfire apparently on private property in the Marble Bay area. When they spoke to him, the property owner put the fire out. But not everyone is as co-operative. On Friday, their warnings were ignored at another campfire in Lake Cowichan. 'We called the police,' said the chief.\"</p><p>And a story from the \"what the heck!?\" files, from the same edition, headlined: \"A nude at the museum\".</p><p>\"Sex and nudity running rampant at the Kaatza Station Museum? Whatever next? Well maybe not really sex, and not quite rampant. But nudity, definitely. There is a man in town who shall nameless, whose nude photo can be seen at the Museum. He knows it is there and doesn't mind a bit, says curator Barbara Simkins. It's a baby picture, not taken very recently.\"</p><p>What an odd little page 2 story. There was no other context and that was the entire story as it ran.</p><p>40 years ago</p><p>The Lake News of Sept. 7, 1983 had a lot happening on the front page. \"Big changes as schools back\", \"Loggers set for strike vote\" and \"Developer appeal foes to minister on Black 28 plan\" were all headlines.</p><p>First, the school situation:</p><p>\"Cowichan Lake district students and teachers returned to the classroom yesterday but it may take a while before everyone is accustomed to the new surroundings. Many local schools underwent a shift during the summer and have emerged in new guises. Little kindergarten and Grade 1 students could be seen in the halls of Palsson School Tuesday as the school begins its first year as a primary school housing Grades 1-4, while at A.B. Greenwell School, Grade 4 students who would normally have left for Palsson this year find themselves kings of the hill at their old haunt. Stanley Gordon School has become a true 'middle school' this year with transitional Grades 5, 6 and 7 in residence. Grade 8 students, meanwhile, will now attend classes at Lake Cowichan Secondary School with Grades 9, 10, 11 and 12.\"</p><p>Next up the strike vote:</p><p>\"About 1,000 loggers and mill-workers in the Cowichan Lake district will take a strike vote this week, joining their counterparts across the province in deciding whether to strike. The workers, members of the International Woodworkers of America, will be asked to support their negotiating team in a rejection of the latest contract offer from Forest Industrial Relations the group that negotiates for the companies.\"</p><p>Finally, the development:</p><p>\"Red Cedar Estates will appeal to Municipal Affairs Minister Bill Ritchie to use his influence in cabinet so that an application to bring the company's Block 28 property into the Village of Lake Cowichan is not delayed further.</p><p>\"'We'll make a personal appeal to the minister,' Bob Hardy of Wright, Hillyard and Parry \u2014 a Duncan surveying and engineering firm \u2014 said Tuesday. His company has been handling plans for a prospective development of the land. Hardy said a letter would be sent to Ritchie this week.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Lake Cowichan Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-news20230910PLC4512804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694T-MB71-JD2C-J2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> Also, if you are in a watercraft, a reminder to steer clear of waterbombers. When waterbombers approach a body of water, move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. <br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services would like to remind the public to use caution when performing any outdoor burning. In order to dispose of yard waste and woody debris, we encourage you to use methods such as composting or using your local landfill. If you must burn, follow Ontario's Outdoor Burning Regulations. <br/><br/> Fires are to be ignited no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise. Always have tools/water adequate to contain the fire at the site. Know the rules for safe outdoor burning. Consult the full set of Outdoor Burning Regulations. <br/><br/> To report a wildland fire located north of the French and Mattawa rivers, please dial 310-FIRE. To report a forest fire located south of the French or Mattawa rivers, please dial 911. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2022080265184683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6631-JMK1-JDV5-F40M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8</p><p>\\x95 Artesian Drive 1,

ADDED May 2, 2024</p><p>TIMELINE</p><p>Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p>City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the rollout of the program.</p><p>In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8</p><p>\\x95 Artesian Drive 1,

It was thought poor air quality may have persisted into Saturday for some areas. <br/><br/> NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE<br/><br/> According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Muskoka. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060968146478</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-HNG1-JDV5-F0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

So many Cowichan citizens know they must decarbonize; that is, burn a lot less fossil fuels \u2014 starting now, not in 2050.</p><p>I use the word \"must\" not to annoy readers, but because many elected municipal councils have declared a climate emergency. If we must pull over for a rushing ambulance, then we must likewise stop burning gas, oil, or wood. Climate chaos is also an emergency.</p><p>One action many can take is to install solar panels, whenever and wherever possible. Free photon energy from the sun emits vastly less carbon gases than fossil fuels, and even hydro.</p><p>Injecting solar's cheap energy into the electric grid would accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Because in our competitive market, cleaner and cheaper solar will replace dirty fossil fuels. Electric heat pumps provide cheaper and cleaner heat than furnaces.</p><p>And so my congratulations to the many Cowichan citizens who are participating in BC Hydro's net metering program which allows solar panels on rooftops or backyards. In this way, clean electricity is injected into both homes and the publicly-owned electric grid.</p><p>Unfortunately, future climate disasters are guaranteed unless we decarbonize more rapidly. Therefore, we should vastly expand Hydro's program. If you have a house, put solar panels on the roof \u2014 the federal government may give you $5,000 cash. You will make money.</p><p>And if your home is under a shady tree or is an apartment, ask your local councillor to encourage community solar co-operatives or to vote for a public solar utility \u2014 both ideas will make money.</p><p>Buying solar panels is an investment, not a cost. You get a financial pay back of over eight per cent per year. And yes, that little bit of electricity will only minimally reduce the climate chaos; but it's a meaningful personal action you can take against climate change. How do I know this?</p><p>Because China gets 50 per cent of its vast solar electricity network from the cumulative impact of individual rooftop solar panels, compared with B.C.'s tiny 0.06 per cent. Clearly there is huge potential for supplying more clean electricity with our many empty roofs and abundant sunshine.</p><p>But this climate emergency will take that sunshine away unless every individual takes action \u2014 our health will go down and our taxes will go up.

But peony bushes passed down from her late mother survived and the blackened Mayday tree planted in memory of her longtime partner is sending up new shoots \u2014 hopeful signs as she prepares to start over in the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement, about 240 miles (385 kilometers) northwest of Edmonton.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t leave,\u201d said Johnston, 72, who shared a home with her son and daughter-in-law. \u201cWhy would I want to leave such beautiful memories?\u201d The worst wildfire season in Canadian history is displacing Indigenous communities from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, blanketing them in thick smoke, destroying homes and forests and threatening important cultural activities like hunting, fishing and gathering native plants.</p><p>Thousands of fires have scorched more than 42,000 square miles (110,000 square kilometers) across the country so far. On Tuesday, almost 900 fires were burning\u2014 most of them out of control \u2014 according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre website.</p><p>Fires aren\u2019t uncommon on Indigenous lands, but they\u2019re now occurring over such a widespread area that many more people are experiencing them at the same time \u2014 and some for the first time \u2014 stoking fears of what a hotter, drier future will bring, especially to communities where traditions run deep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Raymond Supernault, chairman of the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement, where he said more than 85% of the 129-square-mile (334-square-kilometer) settlement burned in the first wildfire there in over 60 years. Fourteen houses and 60 other structures were destroyed by the intense, fast-moving fire that led to the evacuation of almost 300 people and decimated forested land.</p><p>\u201cIn blink of eye, we lost so much \u2026 it was devastating. I can\u2019t stress that enough,\u201d said Supernault, who said he hasn\u2019t seen any elk or moose, both important food sources, since the fire.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t just jump in the car and go to the IGA,\u201d for groceries, Supernault said. \u201cWe go to the bush.\u201d</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 with an even smaller percentage living in predominantly Indigenous communities. Yet more than 42% of wildfire evacuations have been from communities that are more than half Indigenous, said Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada.</p><p>As of Monday, 106 wildfires have affected 93 First Nations communities this year, and there have been 64 evacuations involving almost 25,000 people, according to Indigenous Services Canada.</p><p>It\u2019s not uncommon for Indigenous communities to evacuate repeatedly, Christianson said. A recent analysis of the Canadian Wildland Fire Evacuation database found that 16 communities were evacuated five or more times from 1980\u20132021 \u2014 all but two of them First Nations reserves, said Christianson, who participated in the analysis by the Canadian Forest Service.</p><p>Fires now \u201care so dangerous and so fast-moving\u201d that evacuations increasingly are necessary, a challenge in some remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all, said Christianson, who is M\u00e9tis.</p><p>Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta \u2014 a province where about 7,600 square miles (19,800 square kilometers) have already burned, compared to just over 695 square miles (1,800 square kilometers) in all of 2022 \u2014 said some places burning again this year haven\u2019t fully recovered from previous fires.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time,\u201d said McMullen, calling it the worst fire season in Canadian history. \u201cThese are life-altering events.\u201d</p><p>Christianson said the effects will be felt for generations, because the intense heat is burning the soil and making it difficult for trees and other plants to regenerate.</p><p>She said Indigenous communities are increasingly vulnerable because they\u2019re often left out of decisions about forest management and fire response, and often can\u2019t afford to hire emergency managers. What\u2019s more, when fires affect urban centers at the same time, fire suppression shifts to larger communities.</p><p>Indigenous communities \u201creally want to be leaders in managing fires in their territory,\u201d including a return to preventive burning that was long suppressed by the government, said Christianson.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of and almost surrounded the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>\u201cLast year, me and my wife were talking about how many fires there were in Alberta, then boom! There were so many in Quebec this year,\u201d said Ratt. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, now we\u2019re dealing with wildfires like they are out west.\u2019\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230720RDA0003739331</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RM-VC21-JD2C-J565-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

It is not certain yet where those people will be sent.</p><p>There are also ongoing discussions with Mexico, officials said.</p><p>But Blair said the particularly chal-lenging nature of this season, when big fires are burning in so many different regions, is a concern for having enough people and equipment where and when they are needed.</p><p>Burnout is also an issue, as many firefighters work days on end in extremely harsh conditions.</p><p>\u201cWe are, quite frankly, quite concerned with the early onset and, frankly, almost without precedent the extreme number of fires that we\u2019ve already experienced so far this year. And we are very concerned about risk that current conditions present,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere are a limited number of resources.\u201d</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Canada is moving on the first phase of a Wildfire Training Fund to hire and train Indigenous firefighters in their own communities, 300 new firefighters and another 125 Indigenous fire guardians are being trained this season.</p><p>His department is also working to help retrain urban and rural municipal firefighters, who are mostly trained to battle blazes in buildings, to help respond to wildfires as they increasingly encroach on urban areas.</p><p>More than 200 homes have been burned in Halifax as the Tantallon fire erupted and spread extremely fast over the weekend.</p><p>Wilkinson said six provinces and territories have also already taken advantage of a new $256-million federal fund for wildfire equipment. He said he expects all provinces and territories to use it this year.</p><p>Blair said the government accepted Nova Scotia\u2019s request for federal aid almost immediately Wednesday and the military is already preparing to send in additional help.</p><p>As of mid-afternoon Thursday, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre was reporting 209 active fires burning in eight provinces as well as in the Northwest Territories \u2014 and 87 of them were out of control.</p><p>There are about 28,000 people currently evacuated from their homes, including 18,000 in Nova Scotia alone. There were 25,000 evacuees in Alberta in May, but most of them have been able to return home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKARTS-news20230608HZRA0003639915</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKARTS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-1VT1-F0HF-80HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484153</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Council agreed that they should proceed with Musclow\u2019s recommendation and they\u2019ll be applying for the funding before the Sept. 29 deadline. </p><p>According to Musclow in his report to council on Sept. 12, the CWFPP is developed and put into place to identify the wildfire risks within and surrounding the community, to describe the potential consequences if a wildfire was to impact the community and to examine possible ways to reduce wildfire risks.  </p><p>Funding procured through the FireSmart Communities Grant Program is available up to $15,000 over a two-year period to create a CWFPP, and the deadline to apply is Sept. 29. The applications will be reviewed by a provincial review committee and evaluated based on the submitted project plan. This project plan must address how the municipality will develop and implement the plan within two years. The funding, if successfully procured, will be paid out in three phases; 25 per cent for an approved project plan, 25 per cent for completed hazard forest maps within 10 months of signing a transfer payment agreement, and the remaining 50 per cent paid for an approved CWFPP in the second year. For more details on this program or to order a FireSmart CWFPP development package, contact  Sarah Allen, provincial coordinator, communications and mitigation unit at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sarah.allen@ontario.ca\">sarah.allen@ontario.ca</email>, or Chelsea Osensky, mitigation and partnerships team lead at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chelsea.osensky@ontario.ca\">chelsea.osensky@ontario.ca</email></p><p>Musclow also mentioned that he attempted to have Ken Cox, the southern region fire advisor for aviation, forest fire and emergency services with the Ministry of Northern Development, Natural Resources and Forestry come and give a presentation to council on this proposal to answer any questions that council had, but he was unable to do so until their Oct. 10 meeting.  </p><p>Musclow told The Bancroft Times that they\u2019ll be applying for the FireSmart Communities Grant before the Sept. 29 deadline and as he stated to council at the Sept. 12 meeting, they\u2019ll use any funds they get to develop and implement a Community Wildland Fire Protection Plan. </p><p>\u201cThe CWFFP will enable the township to better plan for any future vegetation (forest, grass, bush, etc.) fires and reduce the risk. The CWFFP will identify areas of high risk and will aid in mitigation efforts. [It] will also help the township educate residents in the prevention of vegetation fires,\u201d he says. \u201cWe invite the residents of the township to our regular council meeting on Oct. 10 at 9 a.m., where we will have a guest speaker [Ken Cox from the MNDMNRF] to educate the pubic on CWFFP.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a5aaf0a0343f40d4b2f335c6a8f3bce8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6979-D3T1-DY9S-T17J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><timeReceived>08:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 21, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is not certain yet where those people will be sent.</p><p>There are also ongoing discussions with Mexico, officials said.</p><p>But Blair said the particularly challenging nature of this season, when big fires are burning in so many different regions, is a concern for having enough people and equipment where and when they are needed.</p><p>Burnout is also an issue, as many firefighters work days on end in extremely harsh conditions.</p><p>\u201cWe are, quite frankly, quite concerned with the early onset and, frankly, almost without precedent the extreme number of fires that we\u2019ve already experienced so far this year. And we are very concerned about risk that current conditions present,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere are a limited number of resources.\u201d Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Canada is moving on the first phase of a Wildfire Training Fund to hire and train Indigenous firefighters in their own communities, 300 new firefighters and another 125 Indigenous fire guardians are being trained this season.</p><p>His department is also working to help retrain urban and rural municipal firefighters, who are mostly trained to battle blazes in buildings, to help respond to wildfires as they increasingly encroach on urban areas.</p><p>More than 200 homes have been burned in Halifax as the Tantallon fire erupted and spread extremely fast over the weekend.</p><p>Wilkinson said six provinces and territories have also already taken advantage of a new $256-million federal fund for wildfire equipment. He said he expects all provinces and territories to use it this year.</p><p>Blair said the government accepted Nova Scotia\u2019s request for federal aid almost immediately Wednesday and the military is already preparing to send in additional help.</p><p>As of mid-afternoon Thursday, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre was reporting 209 active fires burning in eight provinces as well as in the Northwest Territories \u2014 and 87 of them were out of control.</p><p>There are about 28,000 people currently evacuated from their homes, including 18,000 in Nova Scotia alone. There were 25,000 evacuees in Alberta in May, but most of them have been able to return home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RIMREV-news20230606PSEA0003630176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RIMREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DB-DW01-F0HF-843J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464673</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Firefighting resources have also been dispatched to Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's Micoua substation near Baie-Comeau, Legault said.</p><p>On Monday, Legault said authorities had no choice but to leave the hamlet of Clova to burn, drawing the ire of local residents. Legault said Tuesday that he had simply repeated what fire prevention officials told him: the fire around the tiny community about 325 kilometres northwest of Montreal was too intense to send water bombers. That remained true Tuesday, he said, but he noted that no homes had burned.</p><p>Dominic Vincent, the owner of the Auberge Restaurant Clova, said that by Monday afternoon, the situation in the area had already improved, aided by cooler temperatures and a change in wind direction. While smoke remained visible, it was far less intense, he said.</p><p>Vincent said that for three days residents worked with crews from Quebec's forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, to protect the village.</p><p>\"SOPFEU cut firebreaks and we filled tanks with water, along with our friends from the outfitters next to us, to be able to help the places that didn't have water and then we tried to stop the fire along the side of the roads,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>With so many fires burning, Legault said authorities were focusing on towns and critical infrastructure. He met with civil security officials and firefighting teams in Sept-\u00celes, Que., where an evacuation order affecting about 4,500 residents of the town and the nearby Innu community of Mani-Utenam was lifted Tuesday.</p><p>Sept-\u00celes Mayor Steeve Beaupr\u00e9 told a separate news conference that the fire was no longer deemed a threat, but he warned residents to be ready to leave again should the situation change.</p><p>\"I want to make it clear that the fight is far from over,\" Beaupr\u00e9 said after delivering the good news. \"The fire is still large and active and it could remain so for several days, even several weeks, which means that we could be forced to evacuate certain sectors of Sept-\u00celes again.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel was in northwestern Quebec where he said more firefighters were expected Wednesday. He said there are concerns for hydro transmission lines and a high-speed internet connection link to the North.</p><p>He defended the government's response to the fires, saying the province is doing everything it can, but all provinces are dealing with their own wildfires.</p><p>\"We're experiencing an unprecedented situation, exceptional, everywhere on Quebec territory,\" Bonnardel said. \"We've never had so many fires so early in the season, it's not just a problem for Quebec, it's a problem all over Canada.\"</p><p>Another 250 firefighters are expected in the region in the coming days to join the 230 already on the ground, Bonnardel said.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina told reporters in Quebec City that evacuees across the province number just over 8,300, down from 10,000 to start the week, but the Abitibi region remains a concern. \"We are not expecting rain in the short term, which is what makes it more difficult to fight fires,\" Blanchette V\u00e9zina said.</p><p>Forest access bans remain in effect for several regions, and open fires are banned throughout Quebec.</p><p>Jacob Serebrin and Sidhartha Banerjee, The Canadian Press</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230606PAB4478860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DB-DW01-F0HF-83W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

Poor air quality may persist through the day today and possibly into Tuesday for some areas.<br/><br/> NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE<br/><br/> According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Muskoka. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060568100366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-MHT1-JDV5-F303-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Thousands of wildfires tore across enough land to cover Nova Scotia three times, or the city of Toronto 280 times, choking skies with smoke and prompting evacuations of communities. <br/><br/> Now, as focus shifts to next season, some have questioned whether Canada has the fleet of aerial water bombers it needs to keep up with longer, more intense wildfire seasons fuelled by climate change. <br/><br/> \"If we're not going to have supports for our crews for retention and recruitment issues, and we're not going to have the aircraft and equipment ... then I think we're in a lot of trouble,\" said Davidson, a Red Lake, Ont.-based fire management technician who has been fighting wildfires out of Ontario for 10 years.<br/><br/> John Gradek, a lecturer in aviation management at McGill University, estimates almost half of the larger water bombers used to fight Canadian forest fires are nearing the end of their service life.<br/><br/> \"The time has come for us to look at how we fleeted our firefighting equipment for forest fires and rebuild a robust fleet,\" he said. <br/><br/> While certain provinces have expressed interest in replacing some of their more than 50-year-old models, one Canadian company making a large skimmer-style water bomber is reported to be backed up with orders from European countries until at least the end of the decade.<br/><br/> Fixed-wing water bombers - also known as air tankers - are often divided into two types: land-based tankers loaded up with water or fire retardant before takeoff or skimmer-style planes capable of scooping up thousands of litres from a body of water midflight. <br/><br/> Each province is responsible for its own wildland firefighting, creating a patchwork of approaches. <br/><br/>Ontario and Quebec have their own fleets, for example, while British Columbia contracts out aircraft. The Northwest Territories, which had to evacuate the capital city of Yellowknife and several other communities due to wildfires this year, have a mix of government-owned and long-term contracted aircraft. <br/><br/>British Columbia's Ministry of Forest said it's been renewing its fleet of 19 long-term contracted air tankers since 2020. <br/><br/>Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests said the province has 20 fixed-wing aircraft to help fight wildfires, including nine large water bombers that are 24 years old on average. The other 11 smaller aircraft are an average of 53 and 55 years old. <br/><br/> \"The fleet is well-equipped for combating wildfires and supporting transportation in Ontario,\" said Melissa Candelaria, a spokesperson for Forestry Minister Graydon Smith. <br/><br/> A spokesperson for the Northwest Territories' department of Environment and Climate Change, meanwhile, said it would be assessing the need for additional local firefighting capacity given climate-driven changes to wildfire seasons.<br/><br/> The territory's typical fleet of 12 air tankers includes two large air tankers made in 1959, and two large skimmer-style aircraft in 1968 and 1970.<br/><br/> \"While it's tempting to focus on aircraft as it is the most visual and dramatic aspect of wildfire suppression, it is important to note this is only one part of a comprehensive suite of tools we use to manage wildfires,\" said Mike Westwick. <br/><br/> \"It's boots on the ground, assisted by heavy equipment, that play a key role in bringing wildfires under control or putting them out.\" <br/><br/> While Canada has a system in place to get aircraft and other firefighting resources to areas in need, the centre tasked with co-ordinating those requests said it faced pressures this year. <br/><br/> Too many provinces and territories were seeing heightened fire activity at the same time and there were \"very few aircraft\" available to lend to other agencies, said Jennifer Kamau, communications manager for the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre. <br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023123070157702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B0D-SDM1-F197-51VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Not all of them, just those that cheer for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Blue Jays and Buffalo Bills.</p><p><br/><br/> Scientific name: Kicktus Indagutsalot.<br/><br/> While Boston gets six Super Bowls, four World Series titles and a Stanley Cup championship this millennium - and Tampa gets three Stanley Cups and a Super Bowl - fans around here consistently get the athletic equivalent of a flaming sack of dog doo left on their front porch.<br/><br/> These are folks who read \"Old Yeller\" and \"Marley And Me\" because they have happier endings than their team's seasons. They look enviously at fans of the Mudville Nine because Casey only struck out once. And when they go in for a valve repair, they don't require anesthetic because they're so used to having their hearts ripped out of their chest. These are a cursed people. The target of the wrath of some angry sports god. Victims of a giant cosmic joke.<br/><br/> It's not that their teams always stink. That they could deal with because with putridity comes no expectations and no optimism that this will finally be their year. Just a dull ache that can generally be ignored. See: Arizona Coyotes. <br/><br/> No, it's the opposite. All these teams do pretty well - often really well - only to wait until the key moment to concoct the most painful way possible to hurt their fans. Inflicting agony year after year. Build hope, get crushed. Build hope, get crushed. Build hope, get crushed. Build hope ...<br/><br/> For seven years the Toronto Maple Leafs have finished near the top of the NHL standings only to hit the playoffs and belly flop more often than the fat guys lined up poolside at spring break. That 4-1 lead against the Bruins in Game 7 - if you're a Leafs' fan, you need no more information to know exactly what this means - was soul-sucking. Losing to the irrelevant Columbus Blue Jackets in the playoffs added to the grief. Losing to the archrival Montreal Canadiens when they had a 3-1 series lead was a firm kick in the junk. And on and on and on. And we won't even mention David Ayres.<br/><br/> The Blue Jays should've won it all in 2015. They could've won in 2016. Who knows what happens last season if the decision makers don't have an analytics-based brain fart and pull their starter who was pitching brilliantly in a winner-take-all game, only to replace him with a guy who promptly blew it.<br/><br/> They've been in three playoff series in the past four years and have zero wins. Not series wins. Zero victories.<br/><br/> And we won't even mention Shohei Otani.<br/><br/> Since their last championship in 1999, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats have been in four Grey Cups and lost them all. Worse is how they fell. They were pulverized by Saskatchewan in 2013, had a game-winning touchdown called back for a penalty in 2014, and lost in overtime at home in 2021. After a receiver dropped a pass in the end zone with six seconds left in regulation time that would've won it.<br/><br/> And we won't even mention Henry Burris-to-Greg Ellingson.<br/><br/> Then there are the Buffalo Bills.<br/><br/> Yes, we know they're not located in southern Ontario, but considering how many people around here are part of BillsMafia - the name given to their supporters - they may as well be. It's a team with one of the greatest fan bases anywhere. Yet a franchise that seemingly only exists to torment and torture its supporters.<br/><br/> This is a team whose failures are so legendary they have names. Recognizable names. Wide Right, 13 Seconds, The Music City Miracle, the Three-Pass Game, the K.C. OT Coin Flip, Super Bowl XXVI, Super Bowl XXVII, Super Bowl XXVIII. We're probably forgetting a few.<br/><br/> And now Sunday night's entry. Wide Right II. Or Wide Right 2.0. Or Wide Right: The Sequel. Whatever. A long, jagged sliver shoved under their fingernail would be less painful.<br/><br/> Perhaps we should throw the Buffalo Sabres into the mix while we're at it, since there are some fans of that side here, too. Still the only team to lose a Stanley Cup on an illegal goal.<br/><br/> The worst part of all this for the folks who live and die with these outfits? Knowing it's going to happen again. And again. And again.<br/><br/> And then again and again and again and again and again and again and again and ... ah, you know.<br/><br/> There are other fan bases that haven't won recently. Folks who support the Cleveland Browns and Guardians come to mind. But none has experienced the creative ways of having despair dropped on them like they're a forest fire and the universe is a waterbomber as fans of the Sorrowful Four.<br/><br/> Which is why, from now on, every ticket purchased to any of these team's games should come with a coupon for free therapy.<br/><br/> Or just a hug.<br/><br/> Scott Radley is a columnist with The Hamilton Spectator focusing on sports and politics.

Canada has an agreement to share firefighters with six other countries - the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico and Costa Rica.<br/><br/> To date, the centre said 566 firefighters have travelled between provinces this year to help other jurisdictions, and another 443 firefighters and other trained experts have come to Canada from the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023060268062716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CD-RRD1-JDV5-F1NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The call from his superior came on a Thursday. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They said they'd be meeting in Bangor Friday night and I had my graduation Friday night, so I graduated and got my diploma, and headed to Bangor and met with the rest of the crew, and then we headed to Nova Scotia,\" he said in a recent interview.</p><p>Sousa is one of the many foreign firefighters who were pressed into service as Canada battles its worst wildfire season in recent memory. Hailing from 10 different countries on five continents, they've been battling flames, fatigue and mosquitoes during stints of 14 consecutive days or more in unfamiliar conditions.</p><p>In Sousa's case, his main duty at the Barrington Lake fire, in Nova Scotia's southwest, consisted of mapping the extent of the fire by walking around the edge of the burned sector \u2014 called the \u201cblack\u201d \u2014 and marking the perimeter in an app on his phone, as well as putting out the occasional hot spot.</p><p>For some other firefighters, their trip to Canada has yielded a front-row view to infernos of a magnitude few of them had ever seen.</p><p>Eric Flores, the head of a team of more than 100 French firefighters dispatched to Quebec, says the fires are far larger \u2014 and more challenging \u2014 than what he usually sees at home. </p><p>Flores was dispatched to Quebec's Mauricie region, in an area near a First Nations village that can only be accessed by helicopter. During a recent phone interview, Flores said that while the area is wet and swampy, the fire travels through root systems underground, and even under water.</p><p>\"Despite the fact that we have our feet in the water, it's burning,\" he said.</p><p>Flores and his team have been tasked with saving the northern Atikamekw village of Obedjiwan from a 150-square-kilometer fire burning out of control. He said the firefighters are focusing on holding the southern line close to the village with fire breaks, hoses and by digging out smouldering embers before they reach surface vegetation.</p><p>\"Since there are immense trees, the fire takes on inconceivable views very quickly because once the fire starts to come out of the soil, it attacks the trees, it rises to the top and you have trees of 30, 40 metres and that's how you have big fires that start very, very quickly,\" he said.</p><p>As of Wednesday evening, he said the firefighters had been successful at holding back the flames from the community. They've been less successful, however, at holding back the \"incredible number\" of flies and mosquitoes that he describes as their biggest challenge.</p><p>\"Sometimes they're getting eaten alive.\" </p><p>As of Thursday, there were 1,477 foreign firefighters in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta deployed through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, the group said in an email. That number includes firefighters from Mexico, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Costa Rica, Spain and the United States.</p><p>One of the largest contingents is made up of 400 people from South Africa, who are deployed to Alberta and working shifts of 14 days straight, followed by four days off. </p><p>Vincent Lubisi, a strike team leader, has said the South Africans have had to learn how to fight fires in a country with different vegetation and climates.</p><p>In Edson, Alta., where he's been working, he said the focus is on securing the perimeters of the fire and slowly working inward. </p><p>\"In South Africa, they fight the fire more directly,\" he said. </p><p>The contingent includes coordinators such as Antoinette Jini, who helps organize teams on the ground, making sure the assignments are understood and the proper information gets conveyed.</p><p>While South Africans are here to help, she says their experience in Canadais mutually beneficial because it has allowed them to learn about North American resources and techniques, such as those used to map fires.</p><p>\"We have built the relationship and we've learned many things while we're engaging and collaborating,\" she said in a recent interview.</p><p>While the firefighters are working hard, all of them say they've also enjoyed the experience. Sousa has appreciated the beauty of Nova Scotia and the support from residents, while Lubisi says he has had fun collaborating with his foreign colleagues.</p><p>Flores said the French crews were planning Wednesday evening to find time to celebrate the French F\u00eate de la Musique holiday with a little celebration and a few beers. The party would end early, he said, noting the firefighters needed to get up at 5 a.m. the next day for another long day in Quebec's woods.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 23, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5209a74366854df69b0c071e8a790ef6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HX-2HN1-JBVR-34PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 23, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets

This, the second year for the grueling event in Salmon Arm, included 12 Shuswap residents in the approximate 60-participant total. The race began Friday, April 28, at 8 a.m., and wrapped up Saturday night, April 29. The winning runner, Ryan Shephard, 39, from Ab-botsford, ran 43 laps totalling an amazing 288.36 kilometres (179.18 miles).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u07e6 Salmon Arm residents will soon be seeing new signs around town that look similar to those for forest fire danger ratings. To stay ahead of potential drought conditions over the summer, Salmon Arm is in the process of implementing a new system of restricting water usage. In the past, restrictions consisted of allowing irrigation two days per week from May 15 to Oct. 15, regardless of drought and other conditions limiting water supply.</p><p>\u07e6 Flooding is a common spring occurrence at DeMille\u2019s Farm Market. But until last weekend, owner Brad DeMille said he never seen water flow from his field onto the adjacent frontage road that recently served as part of Highway 1. On Monday morning, May 8, DeMille stood perplexed, watching as water from the Salmon River continued to move from one of his fields over the newly constructed walking path and frontage road. The transportation ministry said the water must recede first before it can determine if the road has been damaged.</p><p>\u07e6 The Salmon Arm Silverbacks\u2019 quest for the BCHL\u2019s Fred Page Cup has come to an end. A three-goal rally in the third period Friday night, May 5, wasn\u2019t enough to extend the Interior Conference Finals, as the Penticton Vees used a 7-4 victory to eliminate Salmon Arm in Game 5 of the third-round series at the South Okanagan Events Centre (SOEC).</p><p>\u07e6 A pair of philanthropic Shuswap residents were honoured and remembered with the placement of the 100th brick on the Memorial Walkway at McGuire Lake Park. A ceremony for the placement of the brick recognizing the late Al Neale and Beryl Herdan took place on Wednesday, May 10. Along with their names, the brick includes the words \u201cCelebrating love &amp; community.\u201d</p><p>\u07e6 Another member of Salmon Arm\u2019s renowned basketball community has been inducted into the BC Basketball Hall of Fame. At an awards ceremony on Sunday, May 13, longtime basketball coach Terry Michell joined the ranks of other notable Salmon Arm coaches.</p><p>\u07e6 Mountain bikes were central to a weekend of family fun and friendly competition in Salmon Arm. About 500 mountain-bike riders were at the South Canoe trails Sunday, May 14, for the annual Salty Dog Enduro.</p><p>\u07e6 A large crowd of people gathered at the intersection of Ross Street and Lakeshore Drive at 1 p.m., Wednesday, May 17, for the grand opening of the underpass connecting the city\u2019s downtown to the waterfront.</p><p>\u07e6 Higher than normal temperatures are sparking wildfire concerns throughout the Columbia Shuswap Regional District. \u201cWe\u2019re only in May but it feels like July,\u201d said CSRD FireSmart coordinator Len Youden, who noted the province has identified Crown land throughout the entire regional district, in general, as being at high risk for wildfires.</p><p>\u07e6 Shuswap Lake General Hospital is suffering from a chronic lack of funding and prioritization in the region that is threatening the ability to provide quality critical care. Dr. Scott McKee, head of the internal medicine department at the Salmon Arm hospital, brought this candid message to city council on May 23. McKee said his hope is that council could help to keep the health-care needs of the growing community at the forefront for Interior Health, the Ministry of Health and the board of the North Okanagan Columbia Shuswap Regional Hospital District.</p><p>\u07e6 \u201cHonest, hard working,\u201d is how people who know and work with Ellen Zilkie describe her. So when Zilkie came across more money than she\u2019s ever seen in one place before, she didn\u2019t hesitate. She knew what to do. On Friday, May 12, Zilkie, who keeps city streets clean for Downtown Salmon Arm through the Shuswap Association for Community Living (SACL), was heading past Scotia Bank with her broom and dustpan when she spotted a bunch of $100 bills. She\u2019d found $4,000. She and a SACL staff member went to see if they could find the owner. At Scotia Bank, they learned a man had come in just 10 minutes earlier, asking about the money. The man wasn\u2019t told Zilkie\u2019s name and Zilkie wasn\u2019t told his. But he left a card for her addressed to \u2018finder\u2019 with a bird on it, thanking her, as well as a small reward, she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20231227PSHA0004108699</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B04-NSB1-JD2C-J52T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

S</p><p>Softness has been driven by transitory shocks that merit punting the lost growth into its Q3 forecast.</p><p>May's GDP would probably have been up by at least 0.7% m/m seasonally adjusted (SA) instead of 0.3% as reported if not for the effects of wildfires and maintenance on energy projects in particular but also across other affected sectors, stated the bank. Toss in various strikes like the May Federal civil servants strike and then port disruptions on both coasts into early Q3 and everything from trade figures to wholesaling and warehousing through agriculture and other sectors was temporarily weighed down.</p><p>As forest fire season settles down and ports work off backlogs, Canada should see recoveries. Strike risks will remain but their potentially disruptive effects on short-term growth need to be weighed against what kind of sustained wage and benefit gains are achieved.</p><p>To put some loose math to it, Q2 GDP using monthly GDP estimates a forecast for June GDP that lands in a couple of weeks is likely tracking somewhere around 1% q/q SAAR, according to the bank. If not for these transitory shocks, Q2 GDP growth could easily be double that and perhaps significantly more.</p><p>The BoC should not be fooled by the recent data, added Scotiabank.</p><p>But isn't the 6,000 loss of jobs in July a warning shot that merits caution, asked the bank, which replied with a no. The underlying quality of the numbers looked \"fishy\" to Scotiabank's economist and transitory shocks probably had a similar effect on jobs as on growth. The dip was a rounding error with wide confidence bands and quality issues that might have held back filling vacancies and hours worked.</p><p>The bank said it was \"nonsense\" that the government suddenly embraced austerity and made civil servants into the riskiest profession in July such that 17,000 public administration jobs got lost.</p><p>Losses in transportation and warehousing (-14,000) were likely related to the port strike as workers shifted to strike pay especially into the July Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week. Scotiabank knew that some firms indicated they were curtailing operations because they couldn't get parts due to the strike.
