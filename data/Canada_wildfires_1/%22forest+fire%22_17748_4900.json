Determined to speed up disbursement progress...</p><p>(VAN) The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment has requested Nghe An to expedite the disbursement of ERPA funds, avoid backlogs, ensure the rights of forest owners, and promote sustainable forest development.  Determined to speed up disbursement progress  On September 23, 2025, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment issued Official Letter No. 7045/BNNMT-LNKL, requesting the Chairman of the Nghe An Provincial People\u2019s Committee to strengthen leadership and accelerate the disbursement of ERPA funds across the province. In line with Decree No. 107/2022/N\u0110-CP, as of December 18, 2024, the Ministry had allocated a total of VND 355.59 billion to the Nghe An Provincial Forest Protection and Development Fund for ERPA implementation. An additional VND 37.07 billion is expected to be added from the transfer of one million supplementary tons of CO\u2082, as approved under Resolution No. 261/NQ-CP dated August 29, 2025.

However, according to a report from the Nghe An Provincial Forest Protection and Development Fund, by mid-September 2025, only VND 305.71 billion had been disbursed - equivalent to 85.81% of the plan approved by the Provincial People\u2019s Committee and 85.97% of the allocated amount. Notably, forest owners who are organizations had prepared financial plans totaling VND 205.77 billion (100% of the approved plan), yet only VND 73.12 billion - just 36% - had actually been disbursed.  Delays in preparing, approving, and disbursing financial plans not only reduce the effectiveness of Decree No. 107/2022 but also directly impact the income, livelihoods, and financial capacity for implementing silvicultural measures of forest owners, commune-level People\u2019s Committees, and forest management organizations. Prolonged delays could lead to public frustration, erode community trust, and hinder efforts to protect and develop forests sustainably as well as to meet emission reduction commitments.  Accelerating disbursement progress  In light of the situation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment has requested the Nghe An Provincial People\u2019s Committee to direct the implementation of several specific tasks promptly.  First, the Provincial Forest Protection and Development Fund must urgently disburse the full amount of ERPA funds already allocated to forest owners, commune-level People\u2019s Committees, and forest management organizations in accordance with the 2025 financial plan, ensuring no capital backlog remains in the Fund. The disbursement must be completed by October 15, 2025.  Second, the Fund is required to immediately develop a 2025 - 2026 financial plan and submit it to the Provincial People\u2019s Committee for approval, covering both the remaining balance and the additional VND 37.07 billion expected to be allocated. The disbursement and payments must be finalized by December 31, 2025.  Nghe An has great forest potential. Photo: Dinh Tiep.  Forest owners, commune-level People\u2019s Committees, and forest management organizations have been assigned the responsibility to disburse funds in line with the approved plans promptly. At the same time, they must prepare and approve design documents and cost estimates for implementing silvicultural measures linked to ERPA revenues, in compliance with Circular No. 29/2018/TT-BNNPTNT and Circular No. 17/2022/TT-BNNPTNT. This ensures transparency and allows ERPA funds to be used effectively for practical activities such as forest planting and restoration, forest fire prevention and control, improving local livelihoods, and strengthening community forest management capacity.  The Ministry has also requested the Provincial People\u2019s Committee to review, clarify, and hold accountable any collectives or individuals responsible for delays that affect the implementation progress of the Decree or the rights of forest owners. This measure is intended to reinforce discipline and accountability in fund disbursement and public resource management. Immediately after receiving the Ministry\u2019s Official Letter, the Nghe An Provincial People\u2019s Committee assigned the Department of Agriculture and Environment to take the lead, in coordination with relevant departments, sectors, localities, and units, to organize implementation and advise the provincial authorities on appropriate solutions - demonstrating the province\u2019s strong commitment to resolving bottlenecks.  Delayed ERPA payments affect local people\u2019s incomes. Photo: Dinh Tiep.  Forest management organizations must expedite the completion of documents and procedures, ensure the legal validity of cost estimates, designs, and payment contracts, and maintain transparency in payment progress to local communities to enhance social oversight. Commune-level People\u2019s Committees should closely coordinate with the Fund and forest owners, mobilize local resources, verify beneficiary lists, and monitor the use of funds to prevent losses and inefficiency.  In addition, communication and training activities should be strengthened for forest owners, commune officials, and village leaders on the ERPA mechanism, financial planning procedures, disbursement processes, and eligible silvicultural measures for fund utilization. These efforts will help shorten the time needed for documentation, improve the effectiveness of ERPA fund use, and ensure that expenditures align closely with intended objectives.  Mr. Nguyen Danh Hung, Deputy Director of the Nghe An Department of Agriculture and Environment, stated: \u201cIn terms of progress, compared with the national average, I can affirm that Nghe An is not lagging behind. However, following the Ministry\u2019s and the province\u2019s directives, we will continue to instruct all relevant parties to complete the disbursement as scheduled, ensuring that forest owners, especially individuals and local residents, are not affected or disadvantaged by delays in the ERPA project.\u201d  It can be said that accelerating the ERPA disbursement in Nghe An is an urgent task requiring coordinated action from the Provincial Fund, forest owners, commune-level People\u2019s Committees, and technical agencies. Completing payments on time not only safeguards the legitimate interests of forest owners and communities but also strengthens policy credibility, promotes sustainable forest management and development, and contributes to realizing the North Central Region\u2019s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments. With clear guidance from the Ministry and active engagement from the Provincial People\u2019s Committee, Nghe An is expected to complete the disbursement process soon, ensuring that ERPA funds are efficiently utilized for forest protection and the tangible benefit of local people.  * $1 = VND 26.403 - Source: Vietcombank.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57872558256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXB-NHY3-RTF3-F4HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Nong Nghiep Viet Nam Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 7, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Reliance Global Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Urgently Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Viet Nam</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South-Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>00723</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ULY</className><className>NAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: BMG8598B1413</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Completed entirely using ABB's own resources after approximately a month of work, the project will not only provide a vital water source for livestock farming in the region but also create a significant reservoir against forest fires.  Pond Capacity Increased 6 Times  Twelve machines were in continuous operation in the project, which was implemented without using a tender method and with the coordinated work of the Public Works, ASK\u0130 and Rural Services departments. Initially, approximately 20 thousand cubic meters The volume of the pond was increased by expanding the natural bowl structure. 120 thousand cubic meters removed.  ABB Deputy Secretary General and Head of Rural Services Department Ahmet Mekin Tuzun, stated that this project is the largest livestock drinking water pond ABB has ever built using its own resources. It was explained that 900 truckloads of clay were hauled to the bottom of the pond to create an impermeable layer to prevent water leakage, thus ensuring water retention.  Dual Benefits for Livestock and Fire Fighting  \u00c7aml\u0131dere's forested location further enhances the pond's importance. T\u00fcz\u00fcn emphasized that in addition to meeting livestock drinking water needs, the pond will also serve as a significant water reserve for rapid response in the event of a forest fire. It will also serve as a vital water source for wildlife in the area.  Be\u015fbeyler Neighborhood Headman Bahattin Gursoy, thanked ABB on behalf of the neighborhood residents and stated that this pond was a great need for their neighborhood, which earns its living from animal husbandry, and that they worked with great devotion, day and night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57514465711</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJK-0MV3-RS4M-51T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>RaillyNews</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DR88</classCode><className>METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MCB (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Turkey</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001512</classCode><className>RURAL DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRQJ</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001817</classCode><className>WATER QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N112000CC</classCode><className>ANIMAL FARMING &amp;

About 400 people were ordered to evacuate as a precaution, officials said.</p><p>Interior Undersecretary Mahmud Aleuy said about 100 homes had been damaged, and regional Gov. Gabriel Aldoney said 500 more houses were \"at risk.\" Aleuy said 16 of those injured had respiratory problems.</p><p>Fire brigades, soldiers and forest workers were in the hills combating the fire, which was fueled by winds up to 25 miles per hour (30 kph), low humidity and high temperatures. The fight was complicated because the area is crisscrossed by many ravines, the roads are narrow and water mains are scarce.</p><p>People in Valparaiso wore masks if they ventured into the streets trying to protect themselves against the smoke and fumes.</p><p>In 2014, a forest fire destroyed 2,500 homes and killed 15 people in the hills that surround Valparaiso. The colonial-era city known for colorfully painted cliff-top houses was designated a U.N. World Heritage Site in 2003.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5de9c6eb6b1e491697a81e6451418923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MJ7-4211-JBVR-342B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"218\"/><timeReceived>00:14 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 3, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Santiago</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Chile</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712120GM</classCode><className>HISTORIC DISTRICTS &amp; STRUCTURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712120GM</classCode><className>HISTORIC DISTRICTS &amp; STRUCTURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX069</classCode><className>SANTIAGO, CHILE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC340</classCode><className>CHILE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But not everyone goes to college, and many students never make it to graduation. Among Americans ages 25 and over, only 38% are college graduates, according to the Education Data Initiative.    A report released in May by the resume-writing service Resume Now identifies 13 careers that offer good pay and long-term stability and that don\u2019t require a college degree. Better still, none of the jobs are likely to be replaced by AI.    The analysis \"focused on three or four fears that people have right now,\" said Keith Spencer, a career expert at Resume Now. Americans worry about signs of a softening job market. They\u2019re concerned about the cost of college, and whether a degree is still worth it. And employees in many fields fear that AI \u2013 or robots, or other nonhuman hands \u2013 might sweep in to replace them.   Their fears are not unfounded. One recent survey shows that some service companies in the New York-Northern New Jersey area have scaled back hiring or plan to do so in the next six months because of AI.  Despite the slow creep of automation, many fields still require the human touch. To build out this list, Resume Now found careers that require only a high school diploma, that pay at least $50,000 a year, and that represent growing fields with high-demand skills. The report draws on Bureau of Labor Statistics data.  \"They sort of all have some similarities, in terms of the need for significant human interaction,\" Spencer said. \"Maybe they require manual dexterity in unpredictable environments, or high levels of creativity.\"  The list comes in two parts: jobs with relatively low AI risk, and positions with \"moderate\" AI risk, based on the need for human decision-making, manual labor, personal interactions and other factors.   Some of the jobs listed below require \"a level of relevant experience,\" Resume Now reports. But none, apparently, requires a college degree.   Here\u2019s the list, including job descriptions for less familiar positions and median salaries for all.    What the future of work means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.  Jobs with low AI risk   According to Resume Now, these careers offer a good income and strong job security because they require skills that go well beyond the capabilities of AI.   Forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists   Job description: Judge fire hazards, investigate wildfire causes and enact prevention strategies.   Why they're AI-resistant: Fire prevention requires humans in the field and cannot be entirely automated.   Median pay: $71,420 a year   Flight attendants   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can\u2019t serve meals. In-flight customer service requires a human touch.   Median pay: $68,370 a year   Lodging managers   Job description: Think \"The White Lotus.\" Oversee lodging operations, manage the staff and keep the guests happy.   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can\u2019t unclog a guestroom toilet. You need people to provide the personal touch.    Median pay: $65,360 a year   Electricians   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can\u2019t install your chandelier. Electrical work requires a human presence.   Median pay: $61,590 a year   Plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters   Job description: Plumbers install and service water and gas systems in homes and businesses.   Why they're AI-resistant: Plumbing is unpredictable work. AI-controlled robots could handle some of it but not all.   Median pay: $61,550 a year   Industrial machinery mechanics   Job description: Maintain mechanical systems in industrial workplaces.   Why they're AI-resistant: AI would struggle with the real-time problem-solving demands of the work.    Median pay: $61,170 a year   Chefs and head cooks   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can\u2019t taste the soup. Recipe development and food prep require a creative touch.    Median pay: $58,920 a year   Hearing aid specialists   Job description: Work with hearing aids and provide patient care.   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can\u2019t handle the hands-on requirements of the job.   Median pay: $58,670   Personal service managers   Job description: Oversee wellness programs, event planning or luxury concierge services.   Why they're AI-resistant: The work requires personal interactions, emotional intelligence and decision-making that AI cannot handle.   Median pay: $57,570   Jobs with moderate AI risk   These careers involve tasks that eventually could be automated, Resume Now reports. But, for now, they still rely on human judgment and adaptability.   Maintenance workers, machinery   Job description: Close cousins to the industrial machinery mechanic, listed above, machinery maintenance workers perform routine upkeep on industrial machinery.   Why they're AI-resistant: Complex repairs require real-time problem-solving by humans.   Median pay: $61,170 a year   Insurance sales agents   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can handle some underwriting tasks, but this career requires personal service.    Median pay: $59,080 a year   Aircraft cargo handling supervisors   Why they're AI-resistant: AI can handle some aircraft cargo tasks, but you need human supervisors to handle the unexpected.   Median pay: $58,920   Security and fire alarm systems installers   Why they're AI-resistant: Installing and troubleshooting security and fire systems requires humans.    Median pay: $56,430 a year </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57832645165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GW5-0233-RXR0-R37C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Capecodtimes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 1, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DE9L</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION GRADUATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp;

Nine states \u2014 Assam, Kerala,...</p><p>New Delhi, Oct 1 (UNI) A High-Level Committee (HLC), under the chairmanship of union Home Minister Amit Shah, today approved a number of mitigation, recovery and reconstruction projects having total outlay of Rs. 4645.60 crore.  Nine states \u2014 Assam, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh \u2014 will benefit, a Home Ministry statement said.  The Committee, comprising of Finance Minister, Agriculture Minister and Vice Chairman NITI Aayog as members considered the proposal for financial assistance to the state from National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).  The HLC has approved the restoration and rejuvenation of wetlands plan of Rs 692.05 crore to Assam. The implementation of this project will enhance wetland capacity, create flood storage, increase flood resilience, protect the aquatic environment and will help in economic growth through improved fisheries infrastructure.  Out of total approved outlay of Rs 692.05 crore for the project, the Central share will be Rs 519.04 crore (75 per cent) and state share will be Rs 173.01 crore (25 per cent). This includes projects for mitigation activities towards restoration and rejuvenation of 24 distinct wetlands of nine districts of Assam, spread across the Brahmaputra river system.  Through a number of structural and other measures, this project will enhance water retention capacity of wetlands and Beels and will help mitigate risk of flooding and erosion.  This approval is in line with Home Minister\u2019s vision for the development of wetlands for conservation and flood mitigation in Assam. The project\u2019s long-term coverage is aimed at the entire length of Brahmaputra within Assam and therefore this project would be taken up as a pilot project to establish a flood-proof Brahmaputra valley.  The HLC has also approved the Urban Flood Risk Management Programme (UFRMP) Phase-2 for eleven cities viz. Bhopal, Bhubhaneshwar, Guwahati, Jaipur, Kanpur, Patna, Raipur, Trivandrum, Vishakhapatnam, Indore and Lucknow with a total financial outlay of Rs 2444.42 crore to be funded from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).  The selection of these 11 cities is on the basis of their status of being most populous cities, primarily prone to floods, as well as consideration of other physical, environmental, socio-economic and hydro-meteorological factors. The programme will complement the states in mitigating risk of urban flooding in their cities through uniform structural and non-structural intervention measures.  The funding pattern will be on cost-sharing between the centre and state as per NDMF guidelines i.e 90 percent from Centre and 10 percent from state.  Additionally, out of afore-stated 11 cities, the HLC has approved the programme designed for flood mitigation projects of Guwahati city with a total financial outlay of Rs 200 crore out of which Rs 180 crore will be the central share from NDMF.  The activities involved for urban flood risk mitigation project for Guwahati cities ranges from structural measures of interlinking of water bodies to stormwater management, construction of flood protection wall, erosion control and soil stabilisation using Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) etc as well as non-structural measures such as flood early warning system and data acquisition system and capacity building etc.  Earlier, Central Government had approved urban flood risk management programmes of total financial outlay of Rs 3075.65 crore for seven metro cities \u2014 Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Pune. Further central government had also approved a number of mitigation projects for mitigating the risks of a number of hazards in the areas of landslides (Rs 1000 crore), GLOF (Rs 150 crore), forest fire (Rs 818.92 crore), lightening (Rs 186.78 crore) and drought (Rs 2022.16 crore).  The HLC, also approved financial assistance of an amount of Rs 1270.788 crores to the Assam government and Rs 260.56 crore to Kerala for recovery and reconstruction activities for both the states in the aftermath of flood and landslide incident of 2022 and Wayanad landslide-2024 respectively.  These recovery assistances will help Assam and Kerala in carrying out recovery and reconstruction activities, arisen due to damage and destruction occurred during floodbandandslides 2022 and Wayanad landslide 2024 respectively.  Earlier, the union government had approved recovery and eeconstruction plans for Uttarakhand of Rs 1658.17 crore, in the aftermath of Joshimath land subsistence, for Sikkim of Rs 555.27 crore, in the aftermath of GLOF incident of 2023 and for Himachal Pradesh of Rs 2006.40 crore in the aftermath of flood, landslides, cloudburst incidents in 2023.  This additional assistance is over and above the funds released by the centre to the states in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at the disposal of the states. During the financial year 2025-26, the centre has released Rs 13578.80 crore to 27 states under SDRF and Rs 2024.04 crore to 12 states under NDRF to 12 states.  In addition, Shah had approved advance release of Rs 24.40 crore, as 2nd installment of central share of SDRF, to state government of Sikkim for the year 2025-26.  Moreover, central government has released Rs 4412.50 crore from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) to 21 states and Rs 372.09 crore from National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) to nine states.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57832126199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GW4-TPX3-RT5M-N3WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Central Chronicle</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 1, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000733</classCode><className>FLOOD CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Dry lichens and fallen timber fed the fire, and soon it was raging out of control. Though at first seemingly distant from the cottages and tourist destinations of the region, it wasn't long before smoke blanketed the French River area, turning the sky grey. It became a major news story. Now no one, not residents of Parry Sound, not vacationers idling away days at campsites nor Georgian Bay cottagers, could ignore the fire. Though the fire remained far away, the news media gave a daily reminder that a part of Parry Sound was being devastated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some areas in the PS 33 site look almost 'alien' in the scope of the destruction.</p><p>For more than three months last year, the forest fire (officially designated as Parry Sound 33) raged across, the northern reaches of the district, burning 113.6 square kilometres and forcing the evacuation of Henvey Inlet First Nation French River Provincial Park and a number of cottages. At one point, the fire was within an uncomfortably close seven kilometres of Highway 69. It wasn't until Oct. 31 that the fire had completely been extinguished, by which time the destruction it had wrought was beyond estimation.</p><p>\"Parry Sound 33 was by far the biggest fire in Parry Sound District that I remember or had heard of,\" says Barry Davidson, forest manager for Westwind Forest Stewardship, a not-for-profit forest management company that manages the Crown land in much of Parry Sound and Almaguin, and has the sustainable harvesting licence for the region. \"It was devastating in its size, but the good news is that forests can often recover quickly from fires. Fire is a natural part of many forest ecosystems, and can serve to renew and invigorate them.\"</p><p>Fires, for example, create lots of ash. Nutrients found in the ash enrich the soil, giving a welcome burst of energy to plant life. In addition, the burning-off of dense forest canopies and weedy plants increases sunlight penetration to the forest floor, which similarly results in a flush of vibrant young plant life. In a similar manner, just like pruning plants in your garden helps other plants to thrive, so too does the removal of competing or dead vegetation help to invigorate forests.</p><p>It's for these reasons that forest managers sometimes make use of \"prescribed fires,\" purposefully-lit and carefully managed forest fires.</p><p>A fox snake finds its way through the decimated terrain, which is showing signs of life.</p><p>\"Many forest types have evolved with fire and actually need disturbance to renew,\" explains Davidson. \"Pine, for example, has evolved in such a way that fire has a positive effect on regeneration of the forest. Individual pines may be killed by the fire, but the flames clean out the undergrowth and create a nutrient rich seed bed below. Jack pine actually needs fire to regenerate without logging. Their cones are very tightly bound with natural resin, and it's only when exposed to heat that the resin melts, allowing the cones to open up and the seeds to fall out and sprout.\"</p><p>Evolution has seen white pine develop its own unique relationship with fire. As the tree matures, its bark becomes thick and relatively fire-resistant, ensuring they survive all but the most intense fires. And while they don't have the same kind of cone as Jack pine, their seeds nonetheless benefit from the same process: fire creates a nutrient-rich seed bed, free of competing vegetation. The region through which PS 33 burned also had red oak.</p><p>While trees will have been burned back by the flames, new shoots can emerge from the roots to see the tree live again.</p><p>But, while fire can be beneficial in helping a forest remain vigorous and healthy, Davidson hastens to point out that PS 33 was different in several significant ways. As such, how the region recovers may be different.</p><p>\"Parry Sound 33 was not a typical forest fire and is very different from the forest fires you'll see on the six o'clock news with fire jumping from tree top to tree top,\" he explains. \"The key difference is that the terrain through which the fire burned is not considered a forest, but rather consists mostly of bedrock covered in lichen, shrubs, and fingers of trees where there is enough soil.\"</p><p>\"Because this region is a very different system it's not yet known how many of the usual benefits of a forest fire applies,\" Davidson notes. \"The soil is shallow, so if the fire was intense it would have killed roots. The size of pine wouldn't have been very large, and as such the bark may not have been thick and fire-resistant. Also, as pine may have been small in size, the fire may have burned the live crown, cones included.\"</p><p>Paddling by the fire-ravaged landscape made for an eerie excursion.</p><p>And even in a more conventional forest, fire isn't always beneficial. Particularly dry forest floors and soils can make the forest burn hotter, and extremely hot fires can sterilize the upper layer of the soils by killing microbial life. Extremely hot fires also burn off large amounts of carbon stored in the soil, and change the ability of soil to absorb and retain water, increasing erosion.</p><p>\"There will be winners and losers, in terms of both flora and fauna,\" says Davidson. \"There will be some increases in insect populations, which are in turn food for bird species. And there may be a burst of wild blueberries, which will also benefit some animal species. Typically, young-growth forests recovering from fire become home to a more diverse range of wildlife and plants. Does that apply here? We have many questions still unanswered because it's hard to get into the region.\"</p><p>Davidson has confidence in one thing: \"In time, nature will put something back there; the land will heal itself,\" he says.</p><p>From the pages of Parry Sound Life magazine.

Several thousand schools in the capital and three other cities and districts have been closed since Tuesday.</p><p>He said nearly 300,000 people in the province have suffered respiratory illnesses since January, when it and the five other provinces declared states of emergency due to the forest fires.</p><p>The fires burned parts of the Tesso Nilo National Park in Riau, home to about 140 endangered wild elephants, according to Edward Sanger, the local disaster agency spokesman.</p><p>Thousands of Muslims, many wearing face masks to protest themselves from the smoke, joined mass prayers for rain in Pekanbaru.</p><p>Authorities in Jambi, another province on Sumatra island, also ordered several thousand schools to close.</p><p>About 8,000 people have suffered respiratory problems in the past week alone, according to Jambi's health office.</p><p>Poor visibility caused delays at several airports on Wednesday.</p><p>The Disaster Mitigation Agency said satellites have detected about 5,062 hotspots nationwide on Wednesday morning, with the largest number in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island. It said 37 helicopters have dropped nearly 240 million litres (63 million gallons) of water as part of the firefighting efforts.</p><p>The number of hotspots declined significantly to 2,388 on Wednesday afternoon, the agency said.</p><p>The haze is an annual problem for Southeast Asia. Record Indonesian forest fires in 2015 spread haze across a swath of Southeast Asia, and according to a study by Harvard and Columbia universities, hastened 100,000 deaths.</p><p>The fires are often started by smallholders and plantation owners to clear land for planting. Many areas of Indonesia are prone to rapid burning because of the draining of swampy peatland forests for pulp wood and palm oil plantations.</p><p>In neighbouring Malaysia, the largest city, Kuala Lumpur, and the government administrative centre of Putrajaya were among the areas shrouded in thick smog Wednesday. On Tuesday, hundreds of schools in eastern Sarawak state bordering Indonesia's Kalimantan province were closed for a day after air quality spiked to unhealthy levels.</p><p>Malaysian authorities plan to conduct cloud-seeding activities to induce rain to ease the haze. The government has said it will press Jakarta to take immediate action to put out the burning forests and ensure the fires won't occur again.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Eileen Ng in Hong Kong contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ad1a73ea04bb44b0809e7936e1ea6160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-CVP1-DY9S-T19R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><timeReceived>10:28 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The huge forest fire that erupted Saturday in central Portugal killed at least 64 people and injured 135 more, with many trapped in their cars by the flames.Here is what we know about the disaster:- Evacuations, victims -The fire broke out Saturday just before 3:00 pm (1400 GMT) in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande in the region of Leiria. </p><p>Authorities said the blaze was about 70 percent under control by Monday evening. But the work of the firefighters was being made very difficult by the hot, dry and windy conditions that had contributed to the fire's spread. The flames have advanced rapidly across the pine and eucalyptus tree-covered hills between the villages of Pedrogao Grande, Figueiro dos Vinhos and Castanheira de Pera.Several villages here hit and people were evacuated. Some victims were discovered in homes in isolated regions. But many victims died on the road, trapped in their cars by the blaze.By Monday evening the death toll stood at 64 with 135 injured, including 13 firefighters and 121 civilians and a police officer. Authorities say other victims could be found as searches continue. - Firefighting forces -About 1,000 firefighters and close to 400 vehicles were employed to battle the fire. Spain dispatched four water-bombing aircraft Sunday morning, and three firefighting planes arrived from France in the afternoon.  Two more Spanish airplanes and two Italian aircraft will also be deployed, according to the European Commission. - How the fire started -Police chief Almeida Rodrigues blamed dry thunderstorms for the blaze, ruling out arson, and saying a tree had been struck by lightning. \"We found a tree hit by lightning,\" he said.According to the Secretary of State for the Interior, the flames spread furiously in several directions, reaching a number of villages.The fire was still not contained by Sunday evening, with one of the four fronts remaining a threat. Close to 100 forest fires continued to rage across Portugal Sunday night, with over 2,000 firefighters working to bring them under control. - National mourning -The government has declared three days of national mourning, which started Sunday. \"The fire has reached a level of human tragedy that we have never known before,\" said a visibly moved Prime Minister Antonio Costa.President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet victims' families, saying he was \"sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people\". Schools in the region were closed indefinitely, and exams postponed. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031497910764943251767700010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NV0-VNK1-JCMN-Y11H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><timeReceived>10:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 19, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000425</classCode><className>DEATH RATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000313</classCode><className>CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>PE000DL3R</classCode><className>ANTONIO COSTA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I was pleased with the strong co-ordination between our Cenovus teams, Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, and the Department of National Defence, in particular 4 Wing Cold Lake and CLAWR Range Control. I also want to thank our staff who worked safely and efficiently to get Foster Creek running again.</p><p>Cenovus expects second-quarter production to be reduced by approximately 10,500 bbls per day net due to the shutdown. For the full year, the production impact is estimated to be approximately 2,600 bbls per day net. Cenovus expects full-year production from Foster Creek to remain within its previously announced annual guidance of 62,000 to 68,000 bbls per day net. </p><p>Essential staff were cleared to return to Foster Creek on June 1 to inspect the site and begin start-up activities. Crews found no damage to the Foster Creek facility and infrastructure, and the restart of operations went smoothly. The company is assessing expected costs incurred as a result of the evacuation and the shutdown. </p><p>Foster Creek, which is jointly owned with ConocoPhillips, had average production of approximately 67,500 bbls per day net to Cenovus (135,000 bbls per day gross) before the forest fire. Production has now essentially returned to this range. Total oil production across all of Cenovuss assets averaged about 218,000 bbls per day net in the first quarter of 2015. </p><p>The Athabasca natural gas operation, which was also shut down due to the forest fire, has returned to normal operations as well. The facility produces about 20 mmcf per day of gas, which is used as fuel for Foster Creek. While the forest fire caused minor damage to peripheral equipment at some well sites, the natural gas wells were not affected. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DOILBN-DOB107487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOILBN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G68-NX61-JCM9-54KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300449</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2015  Nickle's Energy Group, a division of HCN Publications Company   All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Oil Bulletin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 11, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000C9J1</classCode><className>CENOVUS ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001NJ1</classCode><className>CONOCOPHILLIPS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS213111 DRILLING OIL &amp;

Last summer, walls of flame a...</p><p>WILDFIREs all but erased vast parts of Jasper National Park in Alberta, one of Canada\u2019s most majestic destinations.  A year later, the devastation left behind is being mined by researchers seeking lessons to fight future fires.  Last summer, walls of flame and ferocious winds ripped up trees, roots and all, which now lie scattered in a charred valley like straw. The fire incinerated the soil, exposed dark bedrock and stripped the bark off trees.  \u201cIt looks like a blast zone,\u201d said Lori Daniels, a researcher, standing on a ridge below Jasper\u2019s famous Marmot Basin, a ski hill in the resort town of Jasper, which has long attracted vacationing royals and Hollywood stars to Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains.  The fire forced 20,000 people to evacuate, destroyed hundreds of properties and shocked a country still reeling from the record destruction of Canada\u2019s 2023 fire season.  The mind-boggling wildfire \u2013 the energy it produced reached levels experts believe had never before been seen in Canada \u2013 has transformed the park into an open-air laboratory for Canadian researchers on the frontiers of evolving wildfire science.  Jasper offers a rare opportunity. Decades of fire-mitigation strategies deployed at the park, meticulously studied and implemented, were put to the extreme test by the fire. Key to those strategies are the use of heavy machinery and prescribed fire to thin the forest and reduce the amount of flammable material.  Daniels, a forest and conservation sciences professor at the University of British Columbia, is leading field research at the site in part to determine how well those strategies worked.  What makes the Jasper fire different from other large-scale blazes Daniels has surveyed is the storm the fire generated, which uprooted or sheared off trees, offering evidence about the blaze\u2019s intensity.  Fire seasons are expected to grow worse because of the effects of climate change, which increase the hot and dry conditions that feed flames.  Landon Shepherd, a firefighter and a wildfire expert at Parks Canada who helped lead the battle against the Jasper fire, said he had never seen a blaze so aggressive in his 30-year career.  Water bomber pilots reported that their helmets banged off the cockpit walls after their aircraft was hammered by winds generated by the fire, Shepherd said, and fire retardant dropped from planes either evaporated or was sucked sideways into the fire\u2019s core long before it could reach its target.  Despite the fire\u2019s intensity, Daniels said she was encouraged by early signs that past wildfire-mitigation efforts blunted the fire\u2019s effects in some areas. Some pine trees still have their needles attached, and there are patches of green amid the charred landscape.  \u201cThere\u2019s strong evidence of success in those treated areas,\u201d said Daniels, who leads the University of British Columbia\u2019s tree ring lab, where scientists study the history and behaviour of forests.  Treating a forest to lessen a fire\u2019s harm is expensive \u2013 up to C$4,000 per acre and Canada has hundreds of millions of acres in need of potential treatment.  Daniels\u2019 work has shown how the previous long-standing policy in Canada of extinguishing all wildfires increased the risk of bigger fires eventually.  Before Jasper was established as a park, Daniels said, the forest burned more frequently, naturally eliminating potential fuel.  \u201cBy suppressing fires, we have actually set the stage for more intense and larger fires,\u201d said Alan Westhaver, a wildfire consultant and one of the architects of Jasper\u2019s fire-mitigation plan.  But the devastation that the fire caused in the town of Jasper could have happened even if the fire itself were smaller, Westhaver said.  Much depends on the trajectory of embers, which are a main reason that homes and other buildings in the path of wildfires burn.  It\u2019s why he dedicated much of his career to a programme teaching owners of private land and homes about ways to make their properties more resilient, including by trimming low branches from nearby trees and removing flammable shrubs from around structures.  Canada\u2019s natural resources department, which houses the Canadian Forest Service and other research branches, promotes the country as a global leader in wildfire management and science.  At least a dozen nations, including the United States, have borrowed or adapted the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, a scientific model to predict the likelihood of whether a wildfire will ignite, and how it will behave if it does.  Canada\u2019s vast forests and range of vegetation allow researchers to look at variables such as plant moisture and how different ways of thinning the forest affect wildfire behaviour.  Canada\u2019s ability to run a variety of tests to see how fire behaves is \u201csecond to none,\u201d said Alexander Maranghides, a fire protection engineer at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Its staff have traveled to Canada to collaborate on research projects, including 3D fire plume imaging and experiments that embed structures in the forest to test prescribed burns.  \u201cCanada has a well-developed technical approach and a long-term research effort that really adds value,\u201d Maranghides said. \u2014 \u00a92025 The New York Times Company  This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57817202461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GVT-WVF3-RT4P-G458-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 29, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000DUV9</classCode><className>ROOTS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS721110 HOTELS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS) &amp;

A person can be held responsible for the costs of extinguishing a forest fire, as well as for any property damage incurred. Anyone who starts a fire must keep it under control at all times and extinguish it properly before leaving the area.</p><p>If you see a forest fire in progress, call the 310-FIRE hotline.

So far this year, an estimated 850,000 acres - an area equivalent to the size of the island of Mallorca - has burned in Spain, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.  The fires have been fanned by strong winds and a heatwave spanning more than two weeks, which sent temperatures up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend, according to the state weather agency.  Some locals have taken it upon themselves to prevent wildfires from reaching their homes.

The huge forest fire that erupted Saturday in central Portugal killed at least 61 people and injured 62 more, many trapped in their cars by the flames.Here is what we know so far about the disaster:- Evacuations, victims -The fire broke out Saturday just before 3:00 pm (1400 GMT) in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande in the region of Leiria. </p><p>In the throes of a heatwave, temperatures soared to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across the region. Fanned by violent winds, flames spread rapidly across the pine and Eucalyptus tree-covered hills between the villages of Pedrogao Grande, Figueiro dos Vinhos and Castanheira de Pera.Several villages here hit and people were evacuated. Some victims were discovered in homes in isolated regions. But many victims died on the road, trapped in their cars by the blaze.At least 18 people died on the N-236, a road linking Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera, according to Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes.Sunday evening the death toll stood at 61 with 62 injured, including eight firemen. Five of the injured were in critical condition (four firemen and a child).Authorities say other victims could be found as searches continue. - Firefighting forces -Over 800 firefighters and more than 260 vehicles were employed to battle the fire. Spain dispatched four water-bombing aircraft Sunday morning, and three firefighting planes arrived from France in the afternoon. Two more Spanish airplanes and two Italian aircraft will also be deployed, according to the European Commission. Ground reinforcements are due to arrive Monday from Spain, said Portugal's Interior Minister Constanca Urbano de Sousa.- How the fire started - Police chief Almeida Rodrigues blamed dry thunderstorms for the blaze, ruling out arson, and saying a tree had been struck by lightning. \"We found a tree hit by lighting,\" he said.According to the Secretary of State for the Interior, the flames spread furiously in several directions, reaching a number of villages.The fire was still not contained on Sunday evening, with one of the four fronts remaining a threat. Over 140 forest fires continued to rage across Portugal Sunday night, with over 2,000 firefighters working to bring them under control. - National mourning -The government has declared three days of national mourning which started Sunday. \"The fire has reached a level of human tragedy that we have never known before,\" said a visibly moved Prime Minister Antonio Costa.President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet victims' families, saying he was \"sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people\". Schools in the region were closed indefinitely, and exams postponed. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031497824235901251766100090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NTS-KGN1-F03R-N22W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><timeReceived>10:17 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 18, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DL3R</classCode><className>ANTONIO COSTA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

BRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union is suffering its worst wildfire season on record, surpassing 1 million hectares burned on Thursday.  Fires have burned 1,016,000 hectares \u2014 an area larger than Cyprus or around a third of the size of Belgium \u2014 since January, data from the bloc\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System analyzed by POLITICO shows.  This is the first time the EU hits the 1 million hectare milestone since EFFIS started keeping records in 2006. The previous worst wildfire season, in 2017, clocked just below 988,000 hectares.  Nearly two-thirds of losses occurred since Aug. 5, when EFFIS showed only 380,000 hectares burned. The vast majority of the fires have occurred in the Iberian Peninsula.  Spain accounts for more than 400,000 hectares burned, while in much-smaller Portugal, flames have consumed more than 270,000 hectares \u2014 or 3 percent of the country\u2019s entire territory. In Spain, where records stretch back to the 1960s, this year is the worst fire season since 1994, according to government data.  Both countries have endured searing heat in recent weeks, desiccating forests and turning the peninsula into a tinderbox. Climate change is exacerbating wildfire risk, bringing more frequent and intense heat waves and droughts.  But scientists say that the main driver of the catastrophic fires in Spain and Portugal is an overabundance of flammable vegetation on abandoned land and authorities\u2019 failure to take preventive measures. Spain\u2019s special prosecutor for environmental issues this week opened an investigation into the lack of fire prevention plans.  Wildfires also release large amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide, with the EU on track for a potential new record for fire-related pollution as well, EFFIS data shows.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57508976021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJD-B0V3-RW7K-V1GB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico.eu</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 21, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Belgium</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

I was hoping that Celine would be a series but \"The River\" runs through entirely new territory: northern Manitoba. Two young men are spending a month canoeing the Maskwa River, ending up at Hudson Bay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was curious to follow their route on Google Maps but found no river by that name, though there is a Moskwa River in central Manitoba. This is how we read now, with Google standing by. I suspect that Heller was using the Winisk River or Nelson River as a model. (In the acknowledgments, he does thank the people of Peawanuk, at the mouth of the Winisk, for their hospitality.)</p><p>In any case, this end-of-summer river trek soon loses its idyllic innocence. Wynn and Jack, best friends since starting university together, smell smoke, so they stop to climb a tree and realize that a forest fire is in the distance. Then they run into two Texan rednecks busy getting drunk. The duo has a motor on their canoe but is in no rush about the smoke. The two lads continue down the lake only to hear shouting, an argument between an unseen man and woman.</p><p>The next day, the plume of smoke has widened to a cloud bank and is definitely closer. Both know the power of a forest fire to jump a river and ignite anything in front of it, a firestorm. But just as they speed up their paddling nearing some rapids that must be portaged, they spot a green canoe with a man paddling heedless of the danger ahead. The man lands his canoe and begins to cry. \" 'My wife,' he said finally. 'She's missing. Gone.' \"</p><p>So, the moral crisis begins. Do they believe Pierre who claims his wife wandered off in the fog? Go back to try to find her and let him get to civilization - 10 days away - and report her missing? And what was the couple arguing about?</p><p>They do retrace their route despite the fire threat and find a woman, badly injured in the weeds near a campsite. It becomes clear that Maia was not attacked by a bear, their first assumption, but beaten by Pierre and left to die. So, now they need to get themselves and this victim to safety and hope that Pierre is not lurking behind the next bend with his shotgun. Oh and not to mention avoiding the rednecks and the fire as well.</p><p>Peter Heller has crafted another fine thriller but this is more literary than genre writing. In flashbacks we learn about Jack's mother's death in a trail-riding accident near their ranch. Both lads are as addicted to good books as they are to outdoor adventuring: canoes, fishing, cooking over an open fire, shaking the frost off the tent in the morning. They're as likely to quote poetry as tease each other in the face of a crisis. Wynn chews tobacco and feels homesick for the Vermont countryside where he grew up.</p><p>Heller in both books uses the wilderness as more than the setting, rather as a force that can drive a couple apart or two friends closer together. My sympathies were definitely with the latter. The couple, who turn out to be rival scientists studying the effects of acid rain on northern flora, are both difficult to tolerate. But things get tragic when the rednecks show up again.</p><p>\"The River\" reminds us that the Garden of Eden is once again the site of The Fall. We as readers crave the innocence of the wilderness but fear its power: survival is more than getting out alive. Next time I hope he uses real place names so I can follow the canoe route at least on a map.</p><p>Chuck Erion is the former co-owner of Words Worth Books, Waterloo</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2019030253646037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ7-N401-F103-33NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

He was flying with fire crews from North Vancouver who have firefighting experience, but said even they were \"blown away by the sheer magnitude of it.\"</p><p>One of the largest is a 40,000 hectare fire south of Burns Lake, at Binta Lake. The largest is at Telegraph Creek, where three smaller fires have merged into a 120,000 hectare fire.</p><p>Westlund also brought equipment to crews in areas with no access except by air. He said there is a huge demand for resources, and Sky may be asked to bring a second aircraft north next week.</p><p>According to the BC Wildfire Service there have been 1,965 fires as of Thursday, and 759,000 hectares have burned, and 429,000 Ha were in the northwest region.</p><p>Last year 1.2 million hectares burned, in the worst fire year on record.</p><p>For more information see www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status</p><p>The closest fire to Maple Ridge is the Mt. Hicks fire just 10 km north of Agassiz.</p><p>\"The work these pilots do is extremely difficult and challenging yet it's very gratifying for them to be taking part in such a monumental effort being mounted by all the forest fire crews,\" said a posting on the Sky Helicopters Facebook page.</p><p>\"We are extremely proud of our entire team for their hard work and commitment to the safety of the people and infrastructure of this province.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MARNWS-3649157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MARNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T43-WPV1-JDH3-G35P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438227</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Maple Ridge News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 24, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Wilderness Society, represented by Environmental Justice Australia, successfully argued a court settlement with Environment Minister Murray Watt and the federal government, arguing they had failed to create mandatory recovery plans for a number of threatened species.    Biodiversity policy and campaign manager for the Wilderness Society Sam Szoke-Burke said the case has achieved an important precedent, namely that making these recovery plans is not optional.    \u201cWhen in place, the recovery plans will have legal heft when the government assesses future development projects \u2014 it won\u2019t be able to ignore them,\u201d he said.    \u201cThe community will also be watching to make sure the plans accurately describe the key threats to each species\u2019 survival, and that the government adequately funds and implements them,\u201d    \u201cAll of these elements will be needed to enable recovery of species that have been neglected by government after government.\u201d    Greater gliders, found in the forests of the Yarra Ranges, are one of four species that will have a recovery plan in place by July 2026, alongside ghost bats, sandhill dunnarts and Australian lungfish. The greater glider was reclassified from vulnerable to endangered in 2022, having first been classified as threatened in 2016.    Ms Szoke-Burke said the Wilderness Society are elated that the greater glider will finally have a recovery plan after years of government delay.    \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic and well-loved species that relies on mature native forests that are often smashed by deforestation,\u201d he said.    \u201cThe greater glider\u2019s recovery must also be premised on the removal of harmful deforestation loopholes in federal laws that allow logging and deforestation to occur without federal oversight,\u201d    \u201cOur supporters have been mobilising across the continent to urge the Environment Minister to close these loopholes as part of the current reform process.\u201d    As a result of the ruling, recovery plans will no longer expire after a period of time (previously having been considered expired after 10 years, known as \u2018sunsetting\u2019) and will now only be removed when a species is no longer listed as threatened and well on its way to recovery.    A government spokesperson said the Albanese Government is on track to deliver recovery plans for the Australian Lungfish, Sandhill Dunnart, Greater Glider (southern and central) and Ghost Bat.    \u201cPlans are currently in their mandatory public consultation period for the Australian Lungfish and Sandhill Dunnart,\u201d they said.    \u201cPublic consultation on plans for the Greater Glider (southern and central) and Ghost Bat will be conducted well before the agreed timeframe for the plans\u2019 completion.\u201d    \u201cThe Albanese Government is investing over $600 million in actions that are directly contributing to the recovery of threatened species and ecological communities.\u201d    An Auditor-General report in 2022 into the management of threatened species and ecological communities found that only two per cent of recovery plans were completed within the statutory time frame since July 2013, making the removal of sunsetting a crucial component to ensuring these plans are seen through to completion. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water website has been updated to reflect this.    President of Warburton Environment Nic Fox said the group feels a huge sense of relief, but also deep disappointment.    \u201cThis outcome shows that the law can still work to protect nature when communities hold governments to account but it really shouldn\u2019t be up to community groups and volunteers to force the government to follow its own laws,\u201d she said.    \u201cThe Court has made it crystal clear that recovery plans are not optional, they are a legal duty, this precedent should push governments to take their responsibilities seriously and deliver recovery plans on time, so species aren\u2019t left waiting while their habitats disappear,\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for species like the greater glider, they\u2019ve been listed as needing a recovery plan since 2016, but one has never been delivered.\u201d    Protection of the greater glider was a talking point in May 2024 when bushfire mitigation works carried out by Forest Fire Management Victoria in the Yarra Ranges National Park resulted in the death of a glider.    Ms Fox said the greater glider recovery plan must focus on protecting and restoring habitat, especially hollow-bearing trees that gliders need for nesting.    \u201cIt should also address stopping logging and deforestation in glider strongholds, securing climate refuges, and ensuring connectivity between forest patches so gliders can survive fires and adapt to change, strong community and scientific monitoring programs should also be part of it,\u201d she said.    \u201cProtecting forests for greater gliders will also help Leadbeater\u2019s Possums, sooty owls, yellow-bellied gliders, and countless other hollow-dependent species,\u201d    \u201cThese forests are home to a whole community of threatened wildlife, when you protect one, you protect many.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57787769621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GV0-GM53-RRXY-G40B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Mountain Views Mail</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 26, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>THE WILDERNESS SOCIETY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Prosperous Future Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prosperous Future Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>01259</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PRFUF</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: KYG2116R1002</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The projects will benefit nine States of Assam, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.  \"To realise Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision of disaster-resilient India, the Ministry of Home Affairs is providing all necessary support to states and UTs,\" the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement.  The Committee, comprising the Finance Minister, Agriculture Minister and Vice Chairman NITI Aayog as members, considered the proposal for financial assistance to the State from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).  The HLC has approved the restoration and rejuvenation of the wetlands plan of Rs 692.05 crore for the State of Assam. The implementation of this project will enhance wetland capacity, create flood storage, increase flood resilience, protect the aquatic environment and help in economic growth through improved fisheries infrastructure. Out of the total approved outlay of Rs 692.05 crore for the project, the central share will be Rs 519.04 crore (75 per cent) and the state share will be Rs 173.01 crore (25 per cent). This includes projects for mitigation activities towards restoration and rejuvenation of 24 distinct wetlands of nine districts of the Assam state, spread across the Brahmaputra river system. Through a number of structural and other measures, this project in Assam will enhance the water retention capacity of wetlands/Beels and will help mitigate the risk of flooding and erosion.  This approval is in line with the Union Home Minister's vision for the development of wetlands for conservation and flood mitigation in Assam. The project's long-term coverage is aimed at the entire length of the Brahmaputra within Assam, and therefore, this project would be taken up as a pilot project to establish a flood-proof Brahmaputra valley.  The HLC has also approved the Urban Flood Risk Management Programme (UFRMP) Phase-2 for eleven (11) cities, viz. Bhopal, Bhubhaneshwar, Guwahati, Jaipur, Kanpur, Patna, Raipur, Trivandrum, Vishakhapatnam, Indore and Lucknow with a total financial outlay of Rs 2444.42 crore to be funded from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).  The selection of these 11 cities is on the basis of their status as being the most populous cities/state capitals, primarily prone to floods, as well as consideration of other physical, environmental, socio-economic and hydro-meteorological factors. The programme will complement the states in mitigating the risk of urban flooding in their cities through uniform structural and non-structural intervention measures. The funding pattern will be on a cost-sharing basis between the Centre and the state, as per NDMF guidelines, i.e., 90 per cent from the Centre and 10 per cent from the state.  Additionally, out of the afore-stated 11 cities, the HLC has approved the programme designed for flood mitigation projects of Guwahati city with a total financial outlay of Rs 200 crore, out of which Rs 180 crore will be the central share from NDMF. The activities involved for the Urban Flood risk mitigation project for Guwahati cities range from structural measures of Interlinking of water bodies to Stormwater Management, Construction of flood protection wall, Erosion Control and Soil Stabilisation using Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), etc., as well as non-structural measures such as Flood Early Warning System and Data Acquisition System and capacity building, etc.  Earlier, the Central Government had approved Urban Flood Risk Management Programmes with a total financial outlay of Rs 3075.65 crore for seven metro cities, namely Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Pune. Further Central Government had also approved a number of mitigation projects for mitigating the risks of a number of hazards in the areas of Landslides (Rs 1000 crore), GLOF (Rs 150 crore), Forest Fire (Rs 818.92 crore), Lightning (Rs 186.78 crore) and Drought (Rs 2022.16 crore).  The HLC also approved financial assistance of an amount of Rs 1270.788 crore to the State Government of Assam and Rs 260.56 crore to the State of Kerala for recovery and reconstruction activities/plan for both the states in the aftermath of the flood/landslide incident of 2022 and Wayanad Landslide-2024, respectively. These recovery assistances will help the States of Assam and Kerala in carrying out Recovery and Reconstruction activities, arising due to damage and destruction caused by the flood/landslides of 2022 and the Wayanad landslide of 2024, respectively.  Earlier, the Central Government had approved Recovery and Reconstruction plans for the state of Uttarakhand of Rs 1658.17 crore, in the aftermath of the Joshimath Land Subsidence, for Sikkim of Rs 555.27 crore, in the aftermath of the GLOF incident of 2023 and for Himachal Pradesh of Rs 2006.40 crore in the aftermath of the flood, landslides, and cloudburst incident of 2023.  This additional assistance is over and above the funds released by the Centre to the States in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at the disposal of the States. During the financial year 2025-26, the Central Government has released Rs 13578.80 crore to 27 States under SDRF and Rs 2024.04 crore to 12 States under NDRF to 12 States.  In addition, the Union Home Minister has approved advance release of Rs 24.40 crore, as 2nd instalment of the Central share of SDRF, to the State Government of Sikkim for the year 2025-26.  Additionally, the Central Government has released Rs 4412.50 crore from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) to 21 States and Rs 372.09 crore from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) to nine states.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57832655792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GW5-0233-RXR0-R2CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ProKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 1, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000733</classCode><className>FLOOD CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Donald J Trump, less than four months into his presidency, had just fired Jim Comey, the FBI Director he had long considered a grandstanding nuisance and personal adversary. The news flash flooded through the press corps and political class. Before I could even finish a phone call to report the story, word came: the president wanted to see me. Minutes later I was ushered into the Oval Office, where Trump, flanked by his most senior advisers, was basking in the drama while at the same time betraying a smattering of unease. On the afternoon of Tuesday, May 9, 2017, I happened to be in the West Wing when the bombshell broke. Donald J Trump, less than four months into his presidency, had just fired Jim Comey, the FBI Director he had long considered a grandstanding nuisance and personal adversary. The news flash flooded through the press corps and political class. Before I could even finish a phone call to report the story, word came: the president wanted to see me. Minutes later I was ushered into the Oval Office, where Trump, flanked by his most senior advisers, was basking in the drama while at the same time betraying a smattering of unease. How will this play?, he wanted to know, genuinely curious, clearly anxious, scanning the faces around him. Would the media savage him? Would Capitol Hill rebel? Would the chattering class denounce him? One didn't need an advanced degree in Trumpology to read the room. The aides were worried, uncertain they had made the right call. There was fear that the move could boomerang, drawing blood not from Comey, but from the president himself. How would the New York Times ' Maggie Haberman, or editors at Cond\u00e9 Nast, write the story? The apprehension was very real. Trump, even then, still cared about such things.

How would the New York Times ' Maggie Haberman, or editors at Cond\u00e9 Nast, write the story? The apprehension was very real. Trump, even then, still cared about such things. That was Trump 1.0. What followed in the years ahead\u2014the Mueller probe, two impeachments, multiple indictments, the loss of the presidency to Biden in 2020, assassination attempts, and endless controversies\u2014burned away that version of Trump like a forest fire clearing dead brush. The man now back in the White House in 2025 is not the same leader who fretted about what the Georgetown cocktail circuit or the morning papers had to say. In 2017, Trump's closest confidantes\u2014his chiefs of staff, Jared and Ivanka, Cabinet officials\u2014constantly sweated the responses from the Hill, the press, and the donor class. Every move was measured against how Washington's so-called adults might react. The firing of Comey was explosive precisely because it violated the delicate rules of that club. It, most certainly, was not the Done Thing. That was Trump 1.0.

In the West Wing, Comey's indictment by Trump's Justice Department after the president publicly pleaded for it, all but demanded it, has largely been met with glee. There has been righteous celebration, not handwringing. Texts and conversations with various Trump advisers Thursday evening and Friday morning produced not a speck or smidge of disquiet, no second thoughts or second guessing.

There has been righteous celebration, not handwringing. Texts and conversations with various Trump advisers Thursday evening and Friday morning produced not a speck or smidge of disquiet, no second thoughts or second guessing. The change is not subtle. In the first term, the president's staff often acted like new parents tiptoeing around a sleeping, tetchy infant, or like nervous homeowners trying to prevent a grease fire in the kitchen from spreading to the rest of the house. Now, they warm their hands as Trump the arsonist, lights the match and smiles as the blaze roars. Donald Trump is unshackled, undeterred, and utterly unfiltered. It is not the case that no adviser ever tells the president to think again before acting. It is instead that Trump is surrounded by like-minded warriors who share his worldview, who experienced the last decade as he did, with him, by his side. It is not that they are afraid to tell Trump to restrain his instincts; they share his instincts. The change is not subtle.

Richard Nixon, after his triumphant 1972 re-election, convinced himself that rules no longer applied and that his enemies would never catch him. Lyndon Johnson, post-1964 landslide, dismissed critics as gnats while escalating the war in Vietnam. But Trump's second incarnation is different: he isn't acting out of false confidence in elite approval. He simply no longer seeks it. In literature, one thinks of Shakespeare's Richard III, who, having seized power, feels free to reveal his ruthlessness. Trump sees himself as having endured hellfire and emerged purified\u2014immune to the establishment's condemnation. In fact, now criticism only reinforces Team Trump's conviction that they did the right thing. History offers plenty of analogies.

Firing him in 2017 once seemed risky, even reckless, because it antagonized Washington's sacred cows. Today, Trump and his loyalists look back and ask: why did we ever care what they thought? Why didn't we double down sooner? That's the defining mindset of Trump 2.0: do anything, say anything, regardless of how the establishment reacts. If Comey symbolized elite respectability, Trump's dismissal of him is now viewed in Trump World as the prototype of the new approach. When the elites cry foul, Team Trump hears applause. When the press squawks, the White House sees evidence of strength. Inside Trump's world at this point, Comey is not a cautionary tale but a symbol.

He no longer bothers with fig leaves. The insults are harsher. The defiance is more brazen. The decisions are made with little regard for how they will be spun on Morning Joe or in the pages of The Atlantic. His squad, no longer stacked with cautious Jared-and-Ivanka types, reflects this posture: lean, loyal, combative. There is no mistaking the risks. Unfiltered leaders often flame out spectacularly. Nixon's paranoia destroyed him. Johnson's hubris cost him a second full term. But Trump has long thrived on risk, turning conventional wisdom inside out. The very things that horrify the elite establishment now both thrill and reassure his base. This shift explains almost everything about Trump's political style in his second presidential term.

And so, more than eight years after that tense May afternoon in the Oval Office, Trump's perspective on Jim Comey tells us everything about his transformation. What once kept his advisers awake at night is now a badge of honor. The lesson, in their narrative: if the ruling class protests, you're probably doing something right. The establishment sees potential democratic ruin. Trump sees liberation. That is the difference between Trump 1.0 and Trump 2.0. And for better or worse, Americans are finding out what that really means, beyond the Oval Office, for the country, as a whole.

The Wilderness Society, represented by Environmental Justice Australia, successfully argued a court settlement with Environment Minister Murray Watt and the federal government, arguing they had failed to create mandatory recovery plans for a number of threatened species.  Biodiversity policy and campaign manager for the Wilderness Society Sam Szoke-Burke said the case has achieved an important precedent, namely that making these recovery plans is not optional.  \u201cWhen in place, the recovery plans will have legal heft when the government assesses future development projects \u2014 it won\u2019t be able to ignore them,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe community will also be watching to make sure the plans accurately describe the key threats to each species\u2019 survival, and that the government adequately funds and implements them,\u201d  \u201cAll of these elements will be needed to enable recovery of species that have been neglected by government after government.\u201d  Greater gliders, found in the forests of the Yarra Ranges, are one of four species that will have a recovery plan in place by July 2026, alongside ghost bats, sandhill dunnarts and Australian lungfish. The greater glider was reclassified from vulnerable to endangered in 2022, having first been classified as threatened in 2016.  Ms Szoke-Burke said the Wilderness Society are elated that the greater glider will finally have a recovery plan after years of government delay.  \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic and well-loved species that relies on mature native forests that are often smashed by deforestation,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe greater glider\u2019s recovery must also be premised on the removal of harmful deforestation loopholes in federal laws that allow logging and deforestation to occur without federal oversight,\u201d  \u201cOur supporters have been mobilising across the continent to urge the Environment Minister to close these loopholes as part of the current reform process.\u201d  As a result of the ruling, recovery plans will no longer expire after a period of time (previously having been considered expired after 10 years, known as \u2018sunsetting\u2019) and will now only be removed when a species is no longer listed as threatened and well on its way to recovery.  A government spokesperson said the Albanese Government is on track to deliver recovery plans for the Australian Lungfish, Sandhill Dunnart, Greater Glider (southern and central) and Ghost Bat.  \u201cPlans are currently in their mandatory public consultation period for the Australian Lungfish and Sandhill Dunnart,\u201d they said.  \u201cPublic consultation on plans for the Greater Glider (southern and central) and Ghost Bat will be conducted well before the agreed timeframe for the plans\u2019 completion.\u201d  \u201cThe Albanese Government is investing over $600 million in actions that are directly contributing to the recovery of threatened species and ecological communities.\u201d  An Auditor-General report in 2022 into the management of threatened species and ecological communities found that only two per cent of recovery plans were completed within the statutory time frame since July 2013, making the removal of sunsetting a crucial component to ensuring these plans are seen through to completion. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water website has been updated to reflect this.  President of Warburton Environment Nic Fox said the group feels a huge sense of relief, but also deep disappointment.  \u201cThis outcome shows that the law can still work to protect nature when communities hold governments to account but it really shouldn\u2019t be up to community groups and volunteers to force the government to follow its own laws,\u201d she said.  \u201cThe Court has made it crystal clear that recovery plans are not optional, they are a legal duty, this precedent should push governments to take their responsibilities seriously and deliver recovery plans on time, so species aren\u2019t left waiting while their habitats disappear,\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for species like the greater glider, they\u2019ve been listed as needing a recovery plan since 2016, but one has never been delivered.\u201d  Protection of the greater glider was a talking point in May 2024 when bushfire mitigation works carried out by Forest Fire Management Victoria in the Yarra Ranges National Park resulted in the death of a glider.  Ms Fox said the greater glider recovery plan must focus on protecting and restoring habitat, especially hollow-bearing trees that gliders need for nesting.  \u201cIt should also address stopping logging and deforestation in glider strongholds, securing climate refuges, and ensuring connectivity between forest patches so gliders can survive fires and adapt to change, strong community and scientific monitoring programs should also be part of it,\u201d she said.  \u201cProtecting forests for greater gliders will also help Leadbeater\u2019s Possums, sooty owls, yellow-bellied gliders, and countless other hollow-dependent species,\u201d  \u201cThese forests are home to a whole community of threatened wildlife, when you protect one, you protect many.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57776437735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTS-BV73-RRKJ-H3MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Ferntree Gully Belgrave Mail</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 25, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Prosperous Future Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prosperous Future Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>01259</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PRFUF</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: KYG2116R1002</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The Wilderness Society, represented by Environmental Justice Australia, successfully argued a court settlement with Environment Minister Murray Watt and the federal government, arguing they had failed to create mandatory recovery plans for a number of threatened species.    Biodiversity policy and campaign manager for the Wilderness Society Sam Szoke-Burke said the case has achieved an important precedent, namely that making these recovery plans is not optional.    \u201cWhen in place, the recovery plans will have legal heft when the government assesses future development projects \u2014 it won\u2019t be able to ignore them,\u201d he said.    \u201cThe community will also be watching to make sure the plans accurately describe the key threats to each species\u2019 survival, and that the government adequately funds and implements them,\u201d    \u201cAll of these elements will be needed to enable recovery of species that have been neglected by government after government.\u201d    Greater gliders, found in the forests of the Yarra Ranges, are one of four species that will have a recovery plan in place by July 2026, alongside ghost bats, sandhill dunnarts and Australian lungfish. The greater glider was reclassified from vulnerable to endangered in 2022, having first been classified as threatened in 2016.    Ms Szoke-Burke said the Wilderness Society are elated that the greater glider will finally have a recovery plan after years of government delay.    \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic and well-loved species that relies on mature native forests that are often smashed by deforestation,\u201d he said.    \u201cThe greater glider\u2019s recovery must also be premised on the removal of harmful deforestation loopholes in federal laws that allow logging and deforestation to occur without federal oversight,\u201d    \u201cOur supporters have been mobilising across the continent to urge the Environment Minister to close these loopholes as part of the current reform process.\u201d    As a result of the ruling, recovery plans will no longer expire after a period of time (previously having been considered expired after 10 years, known as \u2018sunsetting\u2019) and will now only be removed when a species is no longer listed as threatened and well on its way to recovery.    A government spokesperson said the Albanese Government is on track to deliver recovery plans for the Australian Lungfish, Sandhill Dunnart, Greater Glider (southern and central) and Ghost Bat.    \u201cPlans are currently in their mandatory public consultation period for the Australian Lungfish and Sandhill Dunnart,\u201d they said.    \u201cPublic consultation on plans for the Greater Glider (southern and central) and Ghost Bat will be conducted well before the agreed timeframe for the plans\u2019 completion.\u201d    \u201cThe Albanese Government is investing over $600 million in actions that are directly contributing to the recovery of threatened species and ecological communities.\u201d    An Auditor-General report in 2022 into the management of threatened species and ecological communities found that only two per cent of recovery plans were completed within the statutory time frame since July 2013, making the removal of sunsetting a crucial component to ensuring these plans are seen through to completion. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water website has been updated to reflect this.    President of Warburton Environment Nic Fox said the group feels a huge sense of relief, but also deep disappointment.    \u201cThis outcome shows that the law can still work to protect nature when communities hold governments to account but it really shouldn\u2019t be up to community groups and volunteers to force the government to follow its own laws,\u201d she said.    \u201cThe Court has made it crystal clear that recovery plans are not optional, they are a legal duty, this precedent should push governments to take their responsibilities seriously and deliver recovery plans on time, so species aren\u2019t left waiting while their habitats disappear,\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for species like the greater glider, they\u2019ve been listed as needing a recovery plan since 2016, but one has never been delivered.\u201d    Protection of the greater glider was a talking point in May 2024 when bushfire mitigation works carried out by Forest Fire Management Victoria in the Yarra Ranges National Park resulted in the death of a glider.    Ms Fox said the greater glider recovery plan must focus on protecting and restoring habitat, especially hollow-bearing trees that gliders need for nesting.    \u201cIt should also address stopping logging and deforestation in glider strongholds, securing climate refuges, and ensuring connectivity between forest patches so gliders can survive fires and adapt to change, strong community and scientific monitoring programs should also be part of it,\u201d she said.    \u201cProtecting forests for greater gliders will also help Leadbeater\u2019s Possums, sooty owls, yellow-bellied gliders, and countless other hollow-dependent species,\u201d    \u201cThese forests are home to a whole community of threatened wildlife, when you protect one, you protect many.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57777269582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTS-HF63-RSBJ-X0YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Rangers Trader Mail</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 25, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Prosperous Future Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prosperous Future Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>01259</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PRFUF</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: KYG2116R1002</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

He helps clear pastures cheaply, but also leaves blackened earth and charred trees in his wake \u2013 threatening the planet\u2019s largest tropical forest.  In northern Brazil\u2019s cowboy country, fire is so entrenched in ranching that locals nicknamed it \u201cJoao Vermelho\u201d (Red John).  Abandoning it is almost unthinkable.  \u201cFire is a cheap way to maintain pasture. Labour is expensive, pesticides are expensive. Here we don\u2019t have any public funding,\u201d Antonio Carlos Batista, who owns 900 head of cattle in the municipality of S\u00e3o Felix do Xingu, told .  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  During the dry season, a bit of gasoline and a match are enough to get the job done.  When someone goes to light a fire, they say, \u201cI\u2019m going to hire the worker Red John!\u201d said Batista, 62.  But Red John is a worker who cannot be controlled \u2013 and an unprecedented drought in 2024 linked to climate change sent fires blazing out of control, scorching nearly 18 million hectares (44.5 million acres) of the Brazilian Amazon.  The resulting loss of trees caused deforestation to rise four per cent in the 12 months to July, reversing a 30-per cent decline achieved the previous year.  This was a setback for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has pledged to eradicate deforestation by 2030.  For the first time, more tropical forest burned than grassland. Most of the fires began on cattle ranches and spread through dry vegetation to forested areas.  Editor\u2019s Picks  S\u00e3o Felix do Xingu recorded the highest number of fire outbreaks in Brazil \u2013 more than 7,000.  In the Amazon, today \u201cthe big challenge is deforestation caused by fires,\u201d Environment Minister Marina Silva told .  Experts say solving it will require firefighters, stricter sanctions, and, above all, a cultural shift.  Fire \u2018devoured everything\u2019  S\u00e3o Felix is in the Para state, which will host the COP30 UN climate conference in November \u2013 the first to take place in the Amazon \u2013 in its capital, Belem.  Para is almost the size of Portugal, with 65,000 inhabitants and the largest herd of cattle in Brazil, with 2.5 million head, partly for export.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  The municipality is also responsible for Brazil\u2019s worst carbon dioxide emissions due to deforestation, according to 2023 data.  A drone views shows fallen trees in a secondary forest where farmers (not pictured) were in the last stages of clearing land as soybean farming expanded in the Amazon, in Santarem, Para state, Brazil. File image/Reuters  In 2019, Sao Felix took centre stage on the so-called \u201cFire Day,\u201d when landowners deliberately set blazes to support the climate-sceptical policies of then-president Jair Bolsonaro, sparking international outrage.  Here, miles of dusty roads stretch past vast, deforested expanses.  Many of the biggest ranches, with their headquarters in distant cities like Sao Paulo, do not identify themselves.  Some \u2013 like the Bom Jardim ranch, home to 12,000 cattle \u2013 are identified only by a wooden fence.  Bom Jardim\u2019s young foreman, Gleyson Carvalho, seated in the shade outside the stable in a black cowboy hat, with a silver buckle glinting on his belt, admits that using fire is increasingly risky.  \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s good,\u201d he said, because the burned vegetation acts as a natural fertiliser, enriching soil and stimulating growth of more nutritious grass for cattle to eat.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  However, last year, the fires \u2013 which Carvalho insists came from outside the ranch \u2013 \u201cdevoured everything.\u201d  \u201cThere was no food, the cattle lost weight. We had to fight hard to prevent any animals from dying,\u201d he said.  According to satellite data from the Mapbiomas monitoring network analysed by , more than two-thirds of the ranch was burned.  The property belongs to the former mayor of S\u00e3o Felix, Jo\u00e3o Cleber, who has been repeatedly fined for deforestation and other environmental crimes.  Located on the banks of the Xingu River, it borders a Kayapo Indigenous village, whose families suffered from the clouds of toxic smoke from the fires.  \u201cThere were days when you couldn\u2019t even breathe,\u201d said Maria de Fatima Barbosa, a teacher at the village school.  \u201cDuring the night, it was difficult to sleep because the sheets, the bed, everything smelled of smoke.\u201d  A 2021 Greenpeace report notes that the ranch has indirectly sold cattle to Brazilian meatpacking giants Frigol and JBS, which export some of the meat abroad, especially to China in the case of Frigol.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  They alert you  Flying over Sao Felix during the dry season, clouds of smoke can be seen rising over patches of scorched pasture.  \u201cIt\u2019s very sad because you arrive in a region where everything is green, and then the fire comes and destroys everything,\u201d said Jose Juliao do Nascimento, a 64-year-old small-scale rancher in the rural neighbourhood of Casa de Tabua, north of the Bom Jardim ranch.  He was like many farmers in the region, who arrived in the Amazon from the south of the country from the 1960s and 1970s onwards, encouraged by the military regime to clear the land, exploit it and enrich themselves.

Reuters  \u201cA land without men for men without land,\u201d read the slogan of the time.  Last year, the out-of-control flames reached his pasture, as did terrified cows from other properties that had travelled for kilometres in search of food.  The lush forest visible from his small wooden house was burned to the ground.  Although Para state completely banned pasture maintenance fires last year to avoid a major catastrophe, enforcement is weak.  \u201cEveryone has WhatsApp, a phone. When a police car or a car from (environmental watchdog) Ibama shows up, they alert you. That way, even if someone is working with a tractor, they can hide the machine and flee,\u201d he told .  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  Government representatives are scarce in the region.  Ibama president Rodrigo Agostinho told that when officials from the watchdog are called to issue fines, they receive \u201cthreats.\u201d  No one helps us  Small farmers say they feel powerless while large agricultural corporations thrive.  \u201cThey call us criminals of the Amazon, responsible for the fires and deforestation, but no one helps us,\u201d said Dalmi Pereira, a 51-year-old small-scale farmer living in Casa de Tabua.  \u201cHere we have no rights. When the police come, we have to hide.\u201d  Facing some of the small farmers is Agro SB, an agricultural giant in the region.  The company bought land in 2008 to build its Lagoa do Triunfo complex, a ranch the size of a large city.  The ranch has received six environmental fines since 2013, and has yet to pay any of them.  The property recorded more than 300 fires in 2024, according to data analysed by .  That same year, it received the \u201cMore Green Integrity\u201d seal from Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock for \u201cits social responsibility and environmental sustainability practices.\u201d  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  Pereira complains that Agro SB receives preferential treatment when dealing with the government, while \u201cwe remain at the door.\u201d  He and other ranchers are engaged in a standoff with Agro SB over land titles, claiming right of ownership of some of the company\u2019s land by usucapion, a legal process that allows people to claim land they have occupied and used for a certain period.  Agro SB told the ranchers are \u201cinvaders\u201d who it is suing for allegedly starting all the fires recorded on its farm.  No fire brigade  In the Amazon, traditional communities and small producers use fire culturally.  However, the main offenders in razing trees are large farms, followed by illegal miners, said Cristiane Mazzetti, forest coordinator for Greenpeace Brazil.  The mayor of S\u00e3o Felix do Xingu, Fabricio Batista, emphasised that most people do not have titles for their land.  \u201cThe first thing we must do is document the people,\u201d he told at a parade of cowboys on horseback.  \u201cPeople who are documented will be careful with their heritage, because when they don\u2019t have documents, they sometimes do illegal things.\u201d  STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD  Batista also owns a ranch and was himself fined for deforestation in 2014.  He appealed, and the fine was canceled.  He said Sao Felix needs more federal support to fight fires.  \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single fire brigade here. When there\u2019s a fire, who puts it out? We need infrastructure,\u201d he said.  Regino Soares, a 65-year-old farmer and president of the Agricatu small-scale livestock association, lost a fifth of his animals in a fire last year.  He called for controlled burning to be done in a better way.  \u201cYou have to light the fire at the right time, make firebreaks\u201d by removing dry vegetation around the pasture, \u201clet neighbours know when something\u2019s going to burn,\u201d he said.  Back turned to the Amazon  This year, the Amazon is experiencing a reprieve, with fires at their lowest level since records began in 1998.  Ane Alencar, scientific director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, attributes this to a combination of the climate and human factors.  \u201cThe drought persists in some areas, but rainfall has been more evenly distributed this year because the Amazon is in a neutral phase, unaffected by either El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a,\u201d she said.  \u201cThere was also greater oversight by authorities and the effect of trauma on some producers, who were more cautious after what happened in 2024.\u201d  The Ibama president, Agostinho, said the state has intensified surveillance in the Amazon since Lula\u2019s return to office, which followed years of a hands-off approach under Bolsonaro.  Despite deploying record numbers of firefighters, vehicles and aircraft, the effort still looks small against the immensity of a territory spanning five million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles).  Finding and punishing the person who lights the match is also an uphill battle for authorities.  \u201cYou have to conduct an expert report, find someone responsible and consult satellite images,\u201d said Agostinho, adding that Ibama is making progress thanks to artificial intelligence.  Enforcing fines remains a challenge.  Greenpeace showed in 2024 that five years after \u201cFire Day,\u201d the large majority of fines imposed were not paid.  During Lula\u2019s first two terms (2003-2010), monitoring and control policies led to a 70 per cent drop in deforestation in the Amazon.  \u201cThe solution always starts with good public policy,\u201d journalist and filmmaker Joao Moreira Salles, author of an investigative book on the Amazon, \u201cArrabalde,\u201d told .  But he warns that no public policy will succeed without popular support.  \u201cWhat matters most is not that the world sees what\u2019s being done, but that Brazil and Brazilians see it,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe problem is that Brazil has its back turned to the Amazon.\u201d  End of Article</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57969258676</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H0Y-9593-RTR3-64TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Firstpost.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 19, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Fines Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>5125</className><className>TKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: JP3802410005</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Last week, we wrote on how banks are no longer at the centre of the flow of funds to the economy. In FY25, banks accounted for a little over half of the funding that the economy demanded, which is sizeable. But since this share is down from 60 percent in FY23, it\u2019s fair to say banks are ceding ground to other non-bank sources of finance that are primarily the capital markets and non-bank financial companies (NBFCs).  Story continues below This jams up the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s aim to foster quick transmission of policy measures onto interest rates of funding agents. Perhaps the central bank reckoned the same and announced a slew of measures spread over the next couple of years to bring banks front and centre of the funding game. In a nutshell, the measures bring down the requirement for banks to set aside capital when they lend, in turn spurring more lending. The banking regulator has given banks ample time and then some to meet newer capital rules, as the expected credit loss (ECL) method to determine toxic assets will take effect only from April 2027 and will have a generous glide path for banks to meet them.  To be fair, India\u2019s banking system has never been better since the 2016 bad loan nightmare and the pandemic\u2019s blow to growth in 2020. Capital levels are enviably high, bad loans are near lows, though stress has been rising of late. It won\u2019t be adventurous of the RBI to give banks time to meet new norms.  What stood out is the promise that banks would be allowed to participate and increase their exposure to segments hitherto considered risky. A raft of circulars would be issued enabling banks to fund acquisitions, increase their participation in financing equity purchases, in lending against securities and a more principle-based approach to lending to brokers.  In essence, banks won\u2019t be hamstrung in providing the leg-up to generate some wealth in the equity markets, should Indians wish so. The flow of funding into equities just increased.  Over the past few years, capital market agents primarily accessed non-bank lenders for financing their purchases since banks had to adhere to strict overseeing on these transactions. NBFCs have been the biggest players here and now banks can also increase their push here.  Analysts and bankers have termed this as \u201cunshackling the banking industry\u201d. But there are niggling concerns.  Story continues below Has the RBI merely given a well-deserved freedom to banks to be the financiers of wealth creation and in turn get to influence the funding channel more or has it just found a permanent solution to a temporary problem?  Banks have healthy balance sheets, and the hysteresis of past crises has ensured that bankers remain vigilant about risks. But it takes only a spark to light a forest fire and capital markets are treacherous woods. Also, by increasing banking\u2019s footprints into most segments, the central bank can hope for faster policy transmission. Our Chart of the Day shows that NBFCs are not upstanding in the policy transmission process compared with banks. Then again, bond markets tend to respond faster to policy rate changes than banks.  That brings us to the point we made at the beginning that banks have been losing ground in the funding game. The share of the banking sector in flow of funds has had its own ebb and flow historically. A large part of it is simply the fact that borrowers go where the rates are cheaper. NBFCs and the markets have been able to provide cheaper funds at times. But banks have been the go-to counter during uncertain times and bankers have been able to attract business away from other sources, too.  Prudential norms are hardly short-lived and tend to be at least medium-term driven. In giving greater access and freedom to riskier pockets of the economy so that banks are back in the lending game, the central bank may be stepping onto a rocky path.  RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra was clear that the central bank wants to protect financial stability and banks must not overindulge with their new-found freedom. That said, history has enough examples to show that banks tend to get exuberant when growth rates start to show fireworks. Prudential easing and select steps to make it easy for banking customers to transact are aimed at ease of doing banking. But will it lead to ease of doing good business or just risky and easy business?     Investing insights from our research team  WeWork India: Can the IPO ride the flexible workspace growth wave?

There are 247 firefighters and support staff currently working on this incident.</p><p>On the morning of Aug. 9, there are 49 active forest fires across northeast Ontario. Of these, 17 are not yet under control, 32 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There were nine new fires confirmed yesterday (Wednesday, Aug. 8), two of which had already been extinguished, as of 8 a.m. on Thursday, Aug. 9. Parry Sound 41 was not yet under control at 0.4 of a hectare, located just east of Parry Sound 33, at 8 a.m. on Thursday, Aug. 9. It started at approximately 4:33 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 8 and was listed as human-caused. The fire is no longer shown on the map.</p><p>So far in 2018, there have been 971 forest fires inside Ontario's fire region, according to the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. That compares to 354 fires in 2017 and a 10-year average of 567 forest fires per year.</p><p>The evacuation order issued by the Municipality of Killarney for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park still remains in effect. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>The evacuation alert issued by the Municipality of French River for residents in the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64 is still in effect. For more information, call the municipality at 705-898-2294 or visit frenchriver.ca.</p><p>RESTRICTED FIRE ZONES</p><p>Restricted fire zone has expanded to additional parts of the northeast fire region (southern region)</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire activity, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include parts of the southern region of Ontario as outlined on the interactive map. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current MNRF Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>For details on travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use of all waterways east and west of Highway 69 in Mowat, Mason, Bigwood, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick and Travers townships and all associated tributaries that access the river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick Island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet 2, southern boundary from mainland due west to Potvin Point is prohibited unless authorized by travel permit issued by Parry Sound District or Sudbury District Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF).</p><p>All road access west of Highway 69 in Bigwood, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick and Travers townships is prohibited and the unsurveyed lands from the French River to Nesbitt Creek including 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park and to the southern border of Henvey Inlet 2 Indian Reserve, excluding business and residences north of the French River directly adjacent to the west side of Highway 69.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p><p>UPDATE (Tuesday, Aug. 7, 9:40 p.m.): Though not yet under control, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Parry Sound 33 had no new growth Tuesday, August 7. The fire is holding at 11,362 hectares.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter and containment around the fire is almost complete. The total perimeter is almost 120 kilometers long. There are 275 firefighters and support staff currently working on this incident. That number will continue to fluctuate as staff complete their 14 day assignment and more staff become available after days of rest.</p><p>By the evening of August 7, there were 43 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 14 are not yet under control, 29 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, Aug. 7, 9:40 p.m.): Though not yet under control, according to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Parry Sound 33 had no new growth Tuesday, August 7. The fire is holding at 11,362 hectares.</p><p>Although this fire received approximately 10 millimetres of rain, extremely dry fuel conditions remain.</p><p>Firefighters took advantage of the precipitation, high humidity and low winds to continue consolidating hose lines around the perimeter. Crews continued to move inward to solidify control lines.</p><p>By the evening of Aug. 6, there were 44 active forest fires across northeast Ontario. Of these, 18 are not yet under control, 26 are either being held, under control or being observed. There were four new fires confirmed on Monday, Aug. 6, two of which are already been called out, including Parry Sound 38, which was located south of Parry Sound 33. It was confirmed at 0.1 hectares and declared out on Monday, Aug. 6.</p><p>UPDATE (Sunday, Aug. 5, 10:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown once again, to 11,362 hectares and is still not yet under control.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry say it was a challenging, hot and windy day on Aug. 5 and the fire responded as they expected.</p><p>However, even with the challenges and high temperatures, the crews managed to maintain the perimeter of the fire, thanks to the placement of the hose lines. Two minor spot fires on the northeast flank were quickly contained in the morning of Aug. 5.</p><p>Crews have made excellent progress over the last few days and now have hose lines around most of the fire perimeter. More work still needs to be done as crews will work inward to solidify the control lines.</p><p>Some structure protection (sprinklers) will be removed in areas of the fire where full containment has been achieved and the threat from those structures has been removed.</p><p>Some precipitation was reported over the fire on Aug. 5 and the MNRF is hopeful that the interior of the fire receives more rain from the weather system.</p><p>Today (Aug. 6), once again, there is the potential for strong winds. Some unsettled weather may bring some scattered thunderstorms with the possibility of 10 to 15 millimetres of patchy rain. It is anticipated that temperatures will be in the mid to high 20s with high humidity. Winds could august up to 30 kilometres an hour or more.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE (Saturday, Aug 4, 11:23 p.m.)</p><p>No new fires reported.</p><p>News coming from the MNRF for the Northeast region on Aug 4 is positive.</p><p>By the evening of August 4, there were 44 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 19 are not yet under control, 25 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>Nine forest fires are still active to the south and west of Fort Severn in the Far North. FireRanger crews and Coastal Rangers are responding.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE (Friday, Aug. 3 11:39 p.m.)</p><p>\"The fire is suppressed nicely along the Key River.\"</p><p>This good news is coming from the most recent MNRF Northeast Region Forest Fire Situation Update.</p><p>However the fire is still more than 11,000 hectares - a single hectare is about the size of an international soccer pitch. So imaging 11,000 soccer pitches. The evacuees from Henvey are expected to be out of their homes for another week.</p><p>On Friday higher humidity helped firefighers work on the blaze, laying hose around the perimeter of the fire.</p><p>\"Bucketing helicopters assisted crews in keeping the spread of the fire in check,\" states the MNRF release.</p><p>Read the rest of the MNRF release here:</p><p>\"Helicopter bucketing helped suppress isolated pockets of higher intensity, including torching, within the perimeter of the fire.</p><p>The west side of the fire remained quiet. Crews started to work into the interior of the perimeter along the south end of Key Harbour.</p><p>Tomorrow's weather calls for higher temperatures with low humidity. The hot, dry weather, coupled with the forecasted southwesterly winds, may cause an increase in fire behaviour and test our fire lines. If such an event occurs, we have the resources to respond appropriately.</p><p>It is important to note that while good progress is being made, the fire remains active. The conditions continue to be very dry, and extreme burning conditions are still possible. Land and water restrictions remain in place at this time for protection of people, property and to allow our crews to do their work. Patrols from OPP and Conservation Officers will continue throughout the area around the fire.</p><p>We continue to work hard to manage Parry Sound 33 in order to get people back into their residences safely. We thank you for your patience and ongoing support.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Thursday, August 2, 11:40 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,185 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports that Thursday, August 2, was another great day for crews working and laying hose around the perimeter of the fire. Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Monday, July 30, 11:52 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire reportedly expanded by 749 hectares on Monday, reaching 8,973 hectares, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he had held a \"coordination meeting\" Saturday, as France and Italy sent water bombers to an air base near Salamanca to help with the firefighting efforts.  \"The government continues to work to fight the fire with all the means at its disposal,\" he said on X.  The most serious forest fires were in the northwest and west of the country, in the regions of Castile and Leon, Galicia, Asturias and Extremadura.  Around 10 roads remain closed across the country, as well as the train line between Madrid and Galicia. Emergency services in Galicia sent alert messages urging residents in dozens of towns to take precautions.  \"If you receive this alert: remain calm and read the text carefully,\" the alerts said.  \"As the fires spread, avoid all unnecessary travel and stay indoors. If you are outside and have nowhere to stay, move away from the affected areas.\"  Around 3,500 military from a special emergency unit were deployed around the country, with some political leaders calling for more.   Alfonso Fernandez Manueco, the centre-right president of Castile and Leon, asked Sanchez's government \"for an exceptional response: we need more army personnel at the disposal of the regions\".   Extremadura has also made an official request for reinforcements.  In Spain, firefighting is in principle the responsibility of the regions with the central government only intervening in the event of a major disaster.  Smoke from wildfires in Spain and Portugal has reached the UK, the country's Met Office reported.  Since the beginning of the year, more than 157,000 hectares have been reduced to ashes in Spain, according to the real-time map of the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis).  mig/gv/jj</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57470157921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHB-9H73-RT2M-M2BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"365\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ENCA</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 16, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

The fires come amid record heatwaves that have turned Europe into a sweltering sauna above 40 degrees Celsius.  The extreme summer heat has created favorable conditions for rampant wildfires, which have already killed several people and displaced thousands across the continent.  In rural areas of Extremadura, a landlocked autonomous community in the southwest part of Spain, villagers have been forced to evacuate as the fire spread rapidly.  \"I was at home when the wildfire started. I later moved to a distant spot to watch the fire's progression. It was very intense. Then someone mentioned evacuating the entire village, so we left,\" said Florencia, a local resident.  \"The terrain here is extremely steep, sloped and rocky, making ground operations nearly impossible, so we rely almost entirely on air support. The winds keep changing, making the fires likely to reignite. As a result, the situation hasn't improved yet. While some areas have been contained, other fires continue to burn,\" said Antonio, a firefighter.  Many houses have been burned down, and while some residents whose homes were not affected have started to return, many homes remain unoccupied.  \"We weren't allowed back into the village until about an hour ago. Some people have come back, while others haven't because they're worried about the fire. Although there are no flames around the village, the wildfire continues to burn in large areas nearby,\" said Alvarez, another local resident.  More than 59,000 hectares of land have burned in Spain so far in 2025, marking an increase of nearly 25 percent in just the past week, the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) reported on Monday.  With no rain forecast and temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in many regions, Spain continues to suffer from one of the most prolonged heatwaves on record since data collection began in 1975.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57469830888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHB-53F3-RRY6-B2DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BastillePost</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 16, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DVSL</classCode><className>EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2MJ</classCode><className>EXTREMADURA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC303</classCode><className>HONG KONG, CHINA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GR128</classCode><className>EASTERN ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Rural Housing</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REM1RkYzMDYxQThBNDQ0MkIyRkQxODUyMzIyQzY3Qjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzlCQzJCMkVCQ0VFNDlDNDkzMUVDNENCNTMzN0REMjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Thousands of firefighters aided by soldiers and water-bombing aircraft continued to fight fires tearing through parched woodland that were especially severe in northwestern Spain, where the country's weather agency AEMET reported a still \"very high or extreme\" fire risk \u2014 particularly in the Galicia region.  The fires in Galicia have ravaged small, sparsely populated towns, forcing locals in many cases to step in before firefighters arrive.  Firefighting units from Germany arrived in northern Spain on Tuesday to help fight the blazes, Spain's Interior Ministry announced. More than 20 vehicles were deployed to help fight an ongoing blaze in Jarilla in the Extremadura region that borders Portugal, the ministry said.  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was expected to visit Jarilla later Tuesday.  The fires in Spain, which have killed 4 people this year, have burned more than 382,000 hectares or about 1,475 square miles according to the European Union's European Forest Fire Information System. That surface area is more than twice the size of metropolitan London.  Many fires have been triggered by human activity. Police have detained 23 people for suspected arson and are investigating 89 more, Spain's Civil Guard said Tuesday.  In Portugal, more than 3,700 firefighters were tackling blazes, including 4 major ones in the north and centre.  Wildfires there have burned about 235,000 hectares or 907 square miles, according to EFFIS \u2014 nearly 5 times more than the 2006-2024 average for this period. Two people there have died.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.

Thousands of firefighters aided by soldiers and water-bombing aircraft continued to fight fires tearing through parched woodland that were especially severe in northwestern Spain, where the country\u2019s weather agency AEMET reported a still \u201cvery high or extreme\u201d fire risk \u2014 particularly in the Galicia region.  The fires in Galicia have ravaged small, sparsely populated towns, forcing locals in many cases to step in before firefighters arrive.  Firefighting units from Germany arrived in northern Spain on Tuesday to help fight the blazes, Spain\u2019s Interior Ministry announced. More than 20 vehicles were deployed to help fight an ongoing blaze in Jarilla in the Extremadura region that borders Portugal, the ministry said.  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was expected to visit Jarilla later on Tuesday.  The fires in Spain, which have killed 4 people this year, have burned more than 382,000 hectares or about 1,475 square miles according to the European Union\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System. That surface area is more than twice the size of metropolitan London.  Many fires have been triggered by human activity. Police have detained 23 people for suspected arson and are investigating 89 more, Spain\u2019s Civil Guard said Tuesday.  In Portugal, more than 3,700 firefighters were tackling blazes, including 4 major ones in the north and center.  Wildfires there have burned about 235,000 hectares or 907 square miles, according to EFFIS \u2014 nearly 5 times more than the 2006-2024 average for this period. Two people there have died.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57488531060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHX-XBM3-RT42-D16V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>WTOP</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 19, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

I also want to thank our staff who worked safely and efficiently to get Foster Creek running again.\"</p><p>Cenovus expects second-quarter production to be reduced by approximately 10,500 barrels per day (bbls/d) net due to the shutdown. For the full year, the production impact is estimated to be approximately 2,600 bbls/d net. Cenovus expects full-year production from Foster Creek to remain within its previously announced annual guidance of 62,000 bbls/d to 68,000 bbls/d net.</p><p>Essential staff were cleared to return to Foster Creek on June 1 to inspect the site and begin start-up activities. Crews found no damage to the Foster Creek facility and infrastructure, and the restart of operations went smoothly. The company is assessing expected costs incurred as a result of the evacuation and the shutdown.</p><p>Foster Creek, which is jointly owned with ConocoPhillips, had average production of approximately 67,500 bbls/d net to Cenovus (135,000 bbls/d gross) before the forest fire. Production has now essentially returned to this range. Total oil production across all of Cenovus's assets averaged about 218,000 bbls/d net in the first quarter of 2015.</p><p>The Athabasca natural gas operation, which was also shut down due to the forest fire, has returned to normal operations as well. The facility produces about 20 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of gas, which is used as fuel for Foster Creek. While the forest fire caused minor damage to peripheral equipment at some well sites, the natural gas wells were not affected.</p><p>On June 9, Alberta Agriculture and Forestry declared the forest fire on the CLAWR as being held and lifted the precautionary two-hour evacuation notice for Foster Creek.</p><p>ADVISORY</p><p>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION</p><p>This document contains certain forward-looking statements and other information (collectively \"forward-looking information\") about Cenovus's current expectations, estimates and projections, made in light of the company's experience and perception of historical trends. Forward-looking information in this document is identified by words such as \"expect\", \"guidance\", \"estimate\" or similar expressions and includes suggestions of future outcomes, including statements about expected future production and projections contained in the company's 2015 guidance. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information as the company's actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.</p><p>Developing forward-looking information involves reliance on a number of assumptions and consideration of certain risks and uncertainties, some of which are specific to Cenovus and others that apply to the industry generally. The factors or assumptions on which the forward-looking information is based include: the extent of damage caused by the forest fire; assumptions disclosed in Cenovus's 2015 corporate guidance, available at cenovus.com; projected capital investment levels, the flexibility of capital spending plans and the associated source of funding; the company's ability to obtain necessary regulatory and partner approvals; the successful and timely implementation of capital projects or stages thereof; the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet the company's current and future obligations; and other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in the filings Cenovus makes with securities regulatory authorities.</p><p>The risk factors and uncertainties that could cause Cenovus's actual results to differ materially include: the impact of weather conditions on the ability to execute further damage assessment and repair programs; risks associated with any unanticipated damage or other effects of the forest fire; risks associated with any continued, further or additional natural disasters; and the risk factors and uncertainties identified in Cenovus's First Quarter Report, which remain accurate as of the date of this release.

At least 500 more soldiers were deployed to battle 20 major wildfires in Spain, which have torn through parched woodland during a prolonged spell of scorching weather, and have killed two, including a firefighter.  Recommended Stories  The move to add more troops came as authorities struggled to contain forest blazes, especially in the northwestern Galicia region, and awaited the arrival of promised aircraft reinforcements from other European countries.  Firefighters are tackling 12 major wildfires in Galicia, all of them near the city of Ourense, the head of the Galician regional government, Alfonso Rueda, told a press conference with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.  \u201cHomes are still under threat, so we have lockdowns in place and are carrying out evacuations,\" the Associated Press quoted Rueda as saying.  Galicia has been battling the spreading flames for more than a week.  According to a Spanish national weather agency, temperatures in Spain could reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some areas. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 44.7\u00b0C (112.46 F) in the southern city of Cordoba, it said.  The fires in Spain this year have burned 158,000 hectares (390,000 acres), according to the European Union\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System. That is an area roughly as big as metropolitan London.  Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.  AP quoted scientists as saying that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.  top videos  Swipe Left For Next Video  Spain was expecting the arrival of two Dutch water-dumping planes that were to join aircraft from France and Italy already helping Spanish authorities under a European cooperation agreement.

A huge forest fire in central Portugal killed at least 25 people and injured 16 others, most of them burning to death in their cars, the government said Sunday.Several hundred firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched late Saturday to tackle the blaze, which broke out in the afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande before spreading fast across several fronts. </p><p>\"Unfortunately this seems to be the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires,\" the visibly moved Prime Minister Antonio Costa said.\"The number of fatalities could still rise,\" he said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon. \"The priority now is to save those people who could still be in danger.\"Portugal was sweltering under a severe heatwave Saturday, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in several regions.Some 60 forest fires broke out across the country during the night, with around 1,700 firefighters battling to put them out. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said 22 people burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road between Figueiro dos Vinhos and Castanheira de Pera. Three others died from smoke inhalation. Sixteen people were injured, including five firefighters. Two of those were seriously injured.The flames spread \"with great violence\", moving out on four fronts, Gomes said. Dry thunderstorms could have been the cause of the fatal blaze, according to the prime minister.A number of villages were affected by the main fire and evacuation procedures had been put in place for some of them, Costa added. Officials were not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage.Spain dispatched two water-bombing planes on Sunday morning to aid the Portuguese fire service on the ground, the prime minister said. Costa said a period of national mourning would be announced shortly.President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims, \"sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people,\" he said. Firefighters did \"all they could\" when faced with the blaze, he added.Dozens of people who fled their homes were taken in by residents of the nearby municipality of Ansiao. \"There are people who arrived saying they didn't want to die in their homes, which were surrounded by flames,\" Ricardo Tristao of Ansiao told reporters.Portugal was hit by a series of fires last year which devastated more than 100,000 hectares (1,000 square kilometres) of the mainland. Fires on the tourist island of Madeira in August killed three people, while over the course of 2016 around 40 homes were destroyed and 5,400 hectares of land burned. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903149775222010525176530005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NTJ-MJN1-F03R-N1DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><timeReceived>6:16 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 18, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000008</classCode><className>ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DL3R</classCode><className>ANTONIO COSTA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX261</classCode><className>LISBON, PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It will benefit 9 States of Assam, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. To realise Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi\u2019s vision of disaster-resilient India, the Ministry of Home Affairs is providing all necessary support to states and UTs.  The Committee, comprising of Finance Minister, Agriculture Minister and Vice Chairman NITI Aayog as members considered the proposal for financial assistance to the State from National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).  The HLC has approved the restoration and rejuvenation of wetlands plan of Rs.692.05 crore to the State of Assam. The implementation of this project will enhance wetland capacity, create flood storage, increase flood resilience, protect the aquatic environment and will help in economic growth through improved fisheries infrastructure. Out of total approved outlay of Rs. 692.05 crore for the project, central share will be Rs.519.04 crore (75%) and State share will be Rs.173.01 crore (25%). This includes projects for mitigation activities towards restoration and rejuvenation of 24 distinct wetlands of 9 districts of the Assam State spread across the Brahmaputra river system. Through a number of structural and other measures, this project in Assam will enhance water retention capacity of wetlands/Beels and will help mitigate risk of flooding and erosion.  This approval is in line with Union Home Minister\u2019s vision for the development of wetlands for conservation and flood mitigation in Assam. The project's long-term coverage is aimed at the entire length of Brahmaputra within Assam and therefore this project would be taken up as a pilot project to establish a flood-proof Brahmaputra valley.  The HLC has also approved the Urban Flood Risk Management Programme (UFRMP) Phase-2 for eleven (11) cities viz. Bhopal, Bhubhaneshwar, Guwahati, Jaipur, Kanpur, Patna, Raipur, Trivandrum, Vishakhapatnam, Indore and Lucknow with a total financial outlay of Rs.2444.42 crore to be funded from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).  The selection of these 11 cities is on the basis of their status of being most populous cities / State capitals, primarily prone to floods, as well as consideration of other physical, environmental, socio-economic and hydro-meteorological factors. The programme will complement the states in mitigating risk of urban flooding in their cities through uniform structural and non-structural intervention measures. The funding pattern will be on cost-sharing between the Centre and State as per NDMF guidelines i.e 90% from Centre and 10% from State.  Additionally, out of afore-stated 11 cities, the HLC has approved the programme designed for flood mitigation projects of Guwahati city with a total financial outlay of Rs. 200 crore out of which Rs. 180 crore will be the central share from NDMF. The activities involved for Urban Flood risk mitigation project for Guwahati cities ranges from structural measures of Interlinking of water bodies to Stormwater Management, Construction of flood protection wall, Erosion Control and Soil Stabilisation using Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) etc. as well as non-structural measures such as Flood Early Warning System and Data Acquisition System and capacity building etc.  Earlier, Central Government had approved Urban Flood Risk Management Programmes of total financial outlay of Rs. 3075.65 crore for seven metro cities viz. Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Pune. Further Central Government had also approved a number of mitigation projects for mitigating the risks of a number of hazards in the areas of Landslides (Rs.1000 crore), GLOF (Rs. 150 crore), Forest Fire (Rs. 818.92 crore), Lightening (Rs. 186.78 crore) and Drought (Rs. 2022.16 crore).  The HLC, also approved financial assistance of an amount of Rs. 1270.788 crores to the State Government of Assam and Rs. 260.56 crore to the State of Kerala for recovery and reconstruction activities/plan for both the states in the aftermath of flood/landslide incident of 2022 and Wayanad Landslide-2024 respectively. These recovery assistances will help the States of Assam and Kerala in carrying out Recovery and Reconstruction activities, arisen due to damage and destruction occurred during flood/ landslides 2022 and Wayanad landslide 2024 respectively.  Earlier, the Central Government had approved Recovery &amp; Reconstruction plans for the States of Uttarakhand of Rs 1658.17 crore, in the aftermath of Joshimath Land Subsistence, for Sikkim of Rs 555.27 crore, in the aftermath of GLOF incident of 2023 and for Himachal Pradesh of Rs. 2006.40 crore in the aftermath of flood, landslides, cloudburst incident of 2023.  This additional assistance is over and above the funds released by the Centre to the States in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at the disposal of the States. During the financial year 2025-26, the Central Government has released Rs. 13578.80 crore to 27 States under SDRF and Rs. 2024.04 crore to 12 states under NDRF to 12 States.  In addition, Union Home Minister has approved advance release of Rs. 24.40 crore, as 2nd installment of Central share of SDRF, to State Government of Sikkim for the year 2025-26.  Additionally, Central Government has released Rs. 4412.50 crore from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) to 21 States and Rs. 372.09 crore from National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) to 09 States.  ****  RK/VV/PS/PR  (Release ID: 2173811)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57831746369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GW4-N2W3-RRNM-D4DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Press Information Bureau</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 1, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

(TSXV: RKR,OTC:RKMSF) (OTCQB: RKMSF) (FSE: 1RR1) (\"Rokmaster\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to provide an update for the Duncan Lake and Big Copper Projects.  Both the Duncan Lake Project and Big Copper Project are located in southeastern British Columbia and have been steadily advanced by Rokmaster since 2018. Both Projects feature road access in favourable regions with the Trail Smelter within 170 km of the Duncan Lake Project and with the mining town of Kimberley, BC around the Sullivan Deposit within 50 km of the Big Copper Project (Figure 1).  A five-year Multi-year Area Based Exploration Permit (\"MYAB Permit\") was recently approved on the Duncan Lake Project by the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals (Figure 2). The MYAB Permit allows for up to 21 drill sites north of the historic Duncan Mine, which was developed by Cominco 1957-1960. Cominco identified eight mineralized zones but never produced ore from the mine. Between 1989 and 1997, Cominco and Teck Resources completed 12 diamond drillholes approximately 2,000 metres north of the Duncan Mine which intersected strong lead-zinc mineralization in the east limb of the north plunging Duncan Anticline. Rokmaster completed a small drill program in 2022 by re-entering one of these historic drillholes, which are all now on Rokmaster claims, and successfully intersected the west limb of the Duncan Anticline and cored a wide interval of Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization in the east limb (see news release dated May 17, 2022).   There is also a five year MYAB Permit covering the southern No.3, No.2, and No.1 Zones previously approved on the Duncan Lake Project. These zones were partially defined in the 1960's by Cominco who completed small trenching programs on surface exposures of massive sphalerite-galena mineralization in the east limb of the Duncan Anticline. This MYAB Permit allows for 26 drillsites and 15 trenches and while it expired in August 2025, an application to extend the end date on the permit due to a large forest fire which burned the region in 2024. The fire extensively burned throughout the No.2 Zone, No.1 Zone, and the Mag Zone with good potential for new outcrop exposure. The application to extend the permit was submitted in April 2025 and is currently in the consultation stage since June 2025.  Field work on the Duncan Lake Project in 2025 included trenching at the No.3 Zone and further prospecting and sampling in the Mag Zone (Figure 3). This work followed 2023 sampling which collected 127 soil samples and 22 rock samples1. Three of the trenches completed at the No.3 Zone returned high lead and zinc results with appreciable silver grades over meter-scale widths with channel sampling. An outcrop exposure at the No.1 Zone, approximately 3.1 km south of the No.3 Zone, was also channel sampled returning 14.64% combined lead and zinc with 6.67 g/t Ag over 4.5 m (Table 1). More advanced geochemical analysis is ongoing to assess the germanium, gallium, and indium concentrations in the mineralization.

Widths reported are sampled widths, such that true thicknesses are unknown.  2. All assay intervals represent length-weighted averages.  3. Some figures may not sum exactly due to rounding.  4. Samples were prepared and analyzed by MSALABS in Langley BC. After preparation, samples were analyzed for 30 elements including Zn, Pb and Ag by 4-acid digestion of a 0.2 g subsample with ICP-ES finish (MSALAB ore-grade method ICP-240).  A five year MYAB Permit was recently approved on the Big Copper Project by the British Columbia Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals (Figure 4). The MYAB Permit allows for 20 helicopter-supported drillsites and 4 helicopter pads. A field work program was completed on the Big Copper Project in 2023 which collected 165 soil samples and 11 rock samples, highlighting anomalous silver values in the southern portion of the Property2. The Big Copper Property hosts a mineralized deformation and alteration front approximately 4.5 km in strike defined by at least three adits, outcrops, seven trenches and several drillholes which support strong copper-silver mineralization. Mineralized zones are hosted within fine-grained siltstones, argillites and dirty quartzites of the Creston formation. The Creston formation is correlative with the Revett Formation which hosts several large sedimentary hosted copper-silver deposits and undeveloped occurrences in northern Montana and Idaho, including the Spar Lake, Montanore and Rock Creek deposits.   John Mirko, President and CEO, comments:  \"Having these exploration drill permits in hand provides Rokmaster the flexibility to get right to work on these fantastic projects. We have held and advanced the Duncan Lake and Big Copper Projects for many years and believe in the high potential for exploration success on both. Zinc and copper are critical elements which are very important in the current environment, and both projects have an ideal address for a discovery to be made and developed. The elevated silver concentrations on both projects, particularly on the Duncan Lake Project where the strength and significance of silver may not have been fully recognized, is what we're excited to test in addition to the increasingly critical elements.\"  Financing Update  The Company is also pleased to announce that further to its news release on October 7, 2025 that it has closed the first tranche of the flow-through funding (the \"FT Financing\") with the issuance of 11,450,000 FT Units (the \"FT Units\") at a price of $0.04 per FT Unit for gross proceeds of $458,000 (the \"First Tranche\").  Each FT Unit issued in the First Tranche is comprised of one flow-through common share (the \"FT Share\") plus one-half (1/2) non-transferable non-flow-through share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"NFT Warrant\"). Each NFT Warrant is exercisable to purchase one additional non-flow-through common share of the Company (the \"NFT Warrant Share\") at $0.06 for a period of two years expiring on October 15, 2027.  The FT Shares will qualify as \"flow-through shares\" (within the meaning of subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Tax Act\").  The gross proceeds raised from the issuance of the FT Shares will be used by the Company to incur \"Canadian exploration expenses\" (within the meaning of the Tax Act).  In connection with the First Tranche, the Company paid cash finder's fees of $14,000 and issued 350,000 finder's warrants (the \"Finder's Warrant\") with respect to the sale of FT Units to an arm's length subscriber. Each Finder's Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company at $0.05 for a period of two years expiring on October 15, 2027.

But with higher winds came an accelerated fire that was soon approaching the community's borders.</p><p>Smoke began drifting into the First Nation, prompting residents to close windows and shut down air conditioners.</p><p>Ultimately, the chief declared an emergency and the initial transfer of babies, pregnant women, and children under five and their families began.</p><p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, a total of 227 people were flown about 330 kilometres south to Sioux Lookout, which has declared its own state of emergency aimed at defraying the cost of helping the evacuees.</p><p>More than 200 other residents were flown to Timmins, Ont., on Thursday, Meekis said.</p><p>Scott said ministry staff are on scene trying to contain the blaze, noting that weather conditions are expected to remain warm and dry in the coming days.</p><p>\"Crews are placing sprinklers on areas of the community as a precaution,\" he said. \"And they're looking for aerial ... opportunities as well.\"</p><p>Keewaywin's last full evacuation occurred in 2011.

The fires have already consumed over 382,000 hectares this year, with more than 300,000 hectares lost in just the past two weeks. Four people have died and over 30,000 residents have been forced to evacuate their homes. Sanchez directly linked the crisis to climate change, calling it a calamity that requires both immediate response and long-term prevention strategies.  Madrid, Aug 20: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced that his government will declare a civil protection emergency in response to widespread wildfires ravaging the country.  Key Points  Over 382,000 hectares burned in Spain so far in 2025  Four people have died and 30,000 residents evacuated this month  Sanchez pledges government compensation for fire victims  Climate change identified as root cause of worsening wildfire crisis  Sanchez made the announcement on Tuesday during a visit to a firefighting command post in Caceres, southwest Spain, one of the worst-hit areas along with the northwestern regions of Galicia and Castilla-Leon.  Calling the situation \"a calamity,\" Sanchez pledged government support, including compensation for those who have suffered losses from the fires.  According to the European Forest Fire Information System, more than 382,000 hectares have burned in Spain so far in 2025, with over 300,000 hectares destroyed in the past two weeks alone.  Regional emergency services reported that four people have died this month and more than 30,000 residents have been evacuated.  Sanchez also underlined the need to confront climate change, describing it as the root cause of the crisis.  \"We cannot limit ourselves to reacting when fires start. We must prepare the ground so that when they break out, the damage is reduced,\" he said.  Global warming is driving longer, more intense and more frequent heatwaves around the world. By lowering humidity in the air, vegetation and soil, and reducing the threshold at which materials ignite, heatwaves turn vegetation into highly flammable fuel and make wildfires even harder to control.  While the phenomenon has fuelled fires across southern Europe this summer, Spain has been hit particularly hard, finally getting some respite on Tuesday.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57494800232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJ4-2M13-S1C2-43YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewKerala.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 20, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00073BQ</classCode><className>REGIONAL EMERGENCY SERVICES INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

The government continues to work to fight the fire with all the means at its disposal, he said on X.The most serious forest fires were in the northwest and west of the country, in the regions of Castile and Leon, Galicia, Asturias and Extremadura.Around 10 roads remain closed across the country, as well as the train line between Madrid and Galicia. Emergency services in Galicia sent alert messages urging residents in dozens of towns to take precautions. If you receive this alert: remain calm and read the text carefully, the alerts said. As the fires spread, avoid all unnecessary travel and stay indoors. If you are outside and have nowhere to stay, move away from the affected areas. Around 3,500 military from a special emergency unit were deployed around the country, with some political leaders calling for more. Alfonso Fernandez Manueco, the centre-right president of Castile and Leon, asked Sanchez s government for an exceptional response: we need more army personnel at the disposal of the regions . Extremadura has also made an official request for reinforcements.In Spain, firefighting is in principle the responsibility of the regions with the central government only intervening in the event of a major disaster.  AFP | Brais LORENZO  Smoke from wildfires in Spain and Portugal has reached the UK, the country s Met Office reported.Since the beginning of the year, more than 157,000 hectares have been reduced to ashes in Spain, according to the real-time map of the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis).mig/gv/jj</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57470199337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHB-G273-RRS6-N1JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>South Africa News Shafaqna</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 16, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;
