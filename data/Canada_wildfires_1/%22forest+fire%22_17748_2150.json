But until last weekend, owner Brad DeMille said he never seen water flow from his field onto the adjacent frontage road that recently served as part of Highway 1. On Monday morning, May 8, DeMille stood perplexed, watching as water from the Salmon River continued to move from one of his fields over the newly constructed walking path and frontage road. The transportation ministry said the water must recede first before it can determine if the road has been damaged.</p><p>\u07e6 The Salmon Arm Silverbacks' quest for the BCHL's Fred Page Cup has come to an end. A three-goal rally in the third period Friday night, May 5, wasn't enough to extend the Interior Conference Finals, as the Penticton Vees used a 7-4 victory to eliminate Salmon Arm in Game 5 of the third-round series at the South Okanagan Events Centre (SOEC).</p><p>\u07e6 A pair of philanthropic Shuswap residents were honoured and remembered with the placement of the 100th brick on the Memorial Walkway at McGuire Lake Park. A ceremony for the placement of the brick recognizing the late Al Neale and Beryl Herdan took place on Wednesday, May 10. Along with their names, the brick includes the words \"Celebrating love &amp; community.\"</p><p>\u07e6 Another member of Salmon Arm's renowned basketball community has been inducted into the BC Basketball Hall of Fame. At an awards ceremony on Sunday, May 13, longtime basketball coach Terry Michell joined the ranks of other notable Salmon Arm coaches.</p><p>\u07e6 Mountain bikes were central to a weekend of family fun and friendly competition in Salmon Arm. About 500 mountain-bike riders were at the South Canoe trails Sunday, May 14, for the annual Salty Dog Enduro.</p><p>\u07e6 A large crowd of people gathered at the intersection of Ross Street and Lakeshore Drive at 1 p.m., Wednesday, May 17, for the grand opening of the underpass connecting the city's downtown to the waterfront.</p><p>\u07e6 Higher than normal temperatures are sparking wildfire concerns throughout the Columbia Shuswap Regional District. \"We're only in May but it feels like July,\" said CSRD FireSmart coordinator Len Youden, who noted the province has identified Crown land throughout the entire regional district, in general, as being at high risk for wildfires.</p><p>\u07e6 Shuswap Lake General Hospital is suffering from a chronic lack of funding and prioritization in the region that is threatening the ability to provide quality critical care. Dr. Scott McKee, head of the internal medicine department at the Salmon Arm hospital, brought this candid message to city council on May 23. McKee said his hope is that council could help to keep the health-care needs of the growing community at the forefront for Interior Health, the Ministry of Health and the board of the North Okanagan Columbia Shuswap Regional Hospital District.</p><p>\u07e6 \"Honest, hard working,\" is how people who know and work with Ellen Zilkie describe her. So when Zilkie came across more money than she's ever seen in one place before, she didn't hesitate. She knew what to do. On Friday, May 12, Zilkie, who keeps city streets clean for Downtown Salmon Arm through the Shuswap Association for Community Living (SACL), was heading past Scotia Bank with her broom and dustpan when she spotted a bunch of $100 bills. She'd found $4,000. She and a SACL staff member went to see if they could find the owner. At Scotia Bank, they learned a man had come in just 10 minutes earlier, asking about the money. The man wasn't told Zilkie's name and Zilkie wasn't told his. But he left a card for her addressed to 'finder' with a bird on it, thanking her, as well as a small reward, she said.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20231224PSB4553165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69Y8-S331-JD2C-J502-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

So, I'll just say that the fuel was really, really dry,\" she said.</p><p>Gauthier said the extreme dryness, along with coastal winds, may have enabled the fire to burn through the roughly 17 per cent of Crown lands rated as \"wet\" trees, and to burn or move across fields and bogs that make up about a quarter of Crown land in the area.</p><p>Anthony Taylor, a forest ecologist at the University of New Brunswick, said in an interview Thursday that up until the recent fires, there had been a downward trend in the Maritimes in wildfires over the past century due to firefighters' growing ability to extinguish such blazes.</p><p>But he also cited recent research papers indicating climate change is expected to increase average temperatures by several degrees in the next three decades, creating an increase in the number of days each year when fires are more likely to break out in the eastern forests.</p><p>In particular, he references 2018 work by forest fire ecologists, including the University of Alberta's Mike Flannigan, which note the trend over the past 57 years nationally is for the fire season to start \"approximately one week earlier and end one week later.\"</p><p>Taylor said more study is needed to definitely show that climate change is directly linked to the size of the Shelburne fire because the biggest variable remains the potential human influence in its cause.</p><p>However, he added, \"climate change is increasing the number of fire weather days across the country, including in eastern Canada. This means an increase in the number of days each year conducive to supporting fires, and this is projected to get worse.\"</p><p>Gauthier said projections she and other scientists prepared for the frequency of fires in the region, known as the eastern temperate zone, still suggest large fires will be rarer than in other regions of Canada.</p><p>But the measurements of the number of years between the fires is falling sharply under scenarios where the world pumps out more carbon emissions. In the more extreme carbon emission scenario studied, the \"return interval\" of fires goes from about 3,000 years in the 2011-2014 period to 830 years by 2071.</p><p>Forest ecologist Donna Crossland has studied the impact of fires and insect disturbances on Nova Scotia forests, and said she is alarmed by the trends.</p><p>She said in a recent interview that during the time of European colonialization of the province \u2014 before modern firefighting \u2014 large fires were more common in the eastern forests. The retired Parks Canada manager points to historical research from diary entries and letters indicating that in the 1700s and 1800s there were extremely large fires in Nova Scotia that have largely been forgotten.</p><p>She said the early fires, likely linked to land clearing by settlers, left large amounts of the wilderness with degraded soils and smaller trees with branches closer to the ground, which are better able to \"carry the flame.\"</p><p>Crossland said in the pre-settlement woodlands, referred to as the Acadian forest, there was a wider mix of species before widespread burning and heavy harvesting took place.

So, I'll just say that the fuel was really, really dry,\" she said.</p><p>Gauthier said the extreme dryness, along with coastal winds, may have enabled the fire to burn through the roughly 17 per cent of Crown lands rated as \"wet\" trees, and to burn or move across fields and bogs that make up about a quarter of Crown land in the area. </p><p>Anthony Taylor, a forest ecologist at the University of New Brunswick, said in an interview Thursday that up until the recent fires, there had been a downward trend in the Maritimes in wildfires over the past century due to firefighters' growing ability to extinguish such blazes.</p><p>But he also cited recent research papers indicating climate change is expected to increase average temperatures by several degrees in the next three decades, creating an increase in the number of days each year when fires are more likely to break out in the eastern forests.   </p><p>In particular, he references 2018 work by forest fire ecologists, including the University of Alberta's Mike Flannigan, which note the trend over the past 57 years nationally is for the fire season to start \"approximately one week earlier and end one week later.\"</p><p>Taylor said more study is needed to definitely show that climate change is directly linked to the size of the Shelburne fire because the biggest variable remains the potential human influence in its cause. </p><p>However, he added, \"climate change is increasing the number of fire weather days across the country, including in eastern Canada. This means an increase in the number of days each year conducive to supporting fires, and this is projected to get worse.\"</p><p>Gauthier said projections she and other scientists prepared for the frequency of fires in the region, known as the eastern temperate zone, still suggest large fires will be rarer than in other regions of Canada.</p><p>But the measurements of the number of years between the fires is falling sharply under scenarios where the world pumps out more carbon emissions.  In the more extreme carbon emission scenario studied, the \"return interval\" of fires goes from about 3,000 years in the 2011-2014 period to 830 years by 2071. </p><p>Forest ecologist Donna Crossland has studied the impact of fires and insect disturbances on Nova Scotia forests, and said she is alarmed by the trends.</p><p>She said in a recent interview that during the time of European colonialization of the province \u2014 before modern firefighting \u2014 large fires were more common in the eastern forests.

Canadian wildfires \u2014 which consumed an area roughly one-quarter the land mass of Manitoba \u2014 were by far the first choice for The Canadian Press news story of the year, as voted by editors in newsrooms across the country. An unusually warm and dry winter in much of Canada set the stage for a wildfire season that led to 200,000 people fleeing their homes. One of the first communities evacuated was Evansburg, a hamlet west of Edmonton, on April 29. Evacuation orders for other communities were issued in the following days. </p><p>On May 29, Nova Scotia\u2019s fires spun out of control, in a fashion that experts said was an ominous signal for the rest of Canada. \u201cIf Halifax can burn, any place can burn, and that blows all our minds,\u201d said John Vaillant, author of the award-winning \u201cFire Weather:The Making of a Beast.\u201d A heat dome and tinder-dry forests fed the blaze on the outskirts of the Nova Scotia capital. Homeowners, startled by the rapidity of the spread, encountered traffic jams attempting to flee their neighbourhoods. On June 8, during debate in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \u201cCanada is burning.\u201d And the impact was not confined within our borders. Quebec\u2019s lightning-sparked wildfires made international news as the smoke travelled south, giving Toronto among the worst air quality in the world and forcing the cancellation of Major League Baseball games as far away as Washington, D.C.Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency estimated that more than 700 fires burned about 51,000 square kilometres of land, more than the province had ever recorded in a single season. Fires also ravaged the North. About 70 per cent of the population of the Northwest Territories were at some point displaced during the wildfire season. When flames threatened Yellowknife, the capital\u2019s 20,000 residents were ordered out on Aug. 16. People waited in line at the airport for flights while others set off on marathon road trips to Alberta and other regions. Flames came close but did not enter the city, and after three weeks, residents were allowed to return. The territorial election, less than a month away, was pushed to November. Meanwhile, British Columbia also suffered its worst wildfire season on record, with about 400 homes destroyed and more than 2.8 million hectares burned. Fires stoked by drought conditions and howling winds swept down late at night on West Kelowna on the shores of Okanagan Lake in mid-August, making it the centre of the unfolding emergency. The fires caused tragic loss:six firefighters in B.C. died, including four killed in a road crash as they returned home from a two-week deployment. And there were also stories of selflessness, including the efforts of volunteer firefighters such as Mark Zawidzki. He helped extinguish the flames approaching neighbours\u2019 houses in a Halifax suburb as his own burned a few kilometres away. \u201cI just wanted to save somebody else\u2019s house while I could,\u201d Zawidzki told The Canadian Press. Thousands of Canadians suffered long-term economic loss, and began an exhausting odyssey of rebuilding their lives after everything from wedding photos to cars went up in flames. \u201cTypically, wildfire season has been isolated as a British Columbia problem with spillover into Alberta. But 2023 proved wildfires are now a national problem and a harbinger of Canada\u2019s new normal,\u201d said Dawn Walton, managing editor of CTV Calgary. \u201cWildfires will intensify as climate change increases. It will soon become the biggest story in the land,\u201d commented Richard Dooley, supervising producer of Global News in Nova Scotia. Thirty-five per cent of the 97 survey respondents chose wildfires as story of the year. Inflation was the second choice at 25 per cent. As the year came to an end, the University of Waterloo\u2019sIntact Centre on Climate Adaptation said the experience of 2023 will be repeated unless Canadian governments and citizens make significant investments in prevention. \u201cAccording to historical records, current wildfire seasons start roughly one week earlier and end one week later than 70 years ago,\u201d the centre said in a report released Monday. Matt Goerzen, managing editor of the Brandon Sun, noted that discussion of the wildfires reflected the sometimes divisive nature of the climate change debate in Canada. \u201cThese discussions became overly heated during the summer of wildfires that claimed large swaths of Canadian forests, and forced an entire city, Yellowknife, to evacuate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI fear we will only see more of these kinds of stories in the coming years.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20231222PTEA0004103812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69XX-FJV1-F0HF-822D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

There are gaps in mapping and other data that officials need to effectively manage water during times of scarcity.</p><p>The province doesn't keep track of exact usage by most groundwater licence holders, the Ministry of Land, Water and Resource Stewardship confirmed. Rather, the licence sets the maximum amount of water each user can extract.</p><p>That's the case for both domestic and some commercial users,including companies in the forestry, mining, and agricultural sectors, the ministry says.</p><p>At the same time, about two-thirds of pre-existing users have yet to even apply for licences since B.C. first began regulating groundwater in 2016.</p><p>The B.C. Energy Regulator publishes quarterly water-use reports for the oil and gas sector, and some other licensees may be required to report how much they use. Groundwater users may also be asked to complete a \"beneficial use\" declaration to show they're meeting licence terms.</p><p>But it's an incomplete picture of water use throughout the province at a time when signs point to deepening drought.</p><p>Hartwig, as well as Oliver Brandes, a lawyer and policy expert at the University of Victoria, and hydrogeologist Mike Wei, who retired from working for the province in 2018, say B.C. lacks sufficient mapping and details on groundwater sources.</p><p>B.C.'s minister for land, water and resource stewardship, Nathan Cullen, says drought wasn't always front of mind for B.C. governments and the public.</p><p>\"If there were worries (about) water, historically, there was often too much, right?\"</p><p>Cullen's fledgling ministry is now tasked with catching up to today's climate reality and delivering the province's watershed security strategy, expected sometime this year.</p><p>An intentions paper shows priority areas include enhancing monitoring and addressing data gaps.</p><p>The B.C.-First Nations Water Table is co-developing the strategy, and Cullen says the province is working to establish additional community-based groups this spring. </p><p>Many of those tables involve members of the agricultural sector, he says, pointing to the recent announcement of $80 million in additional funding for the province's agricultural water infrastructure program to help farmers weather times of drought.</p><p>\"The scope and scale of the challenges is real to my mind,\" Cullen says.</p><p>But \"standing up what may be dozens and dozens of these community water tables in short order ... is very much in the government's interest,\" he says.</p><p>\"This costs us one way or the other,\" the minister adds. \"Better water management is a lot cheaper than the management of crisis, similar to forest fire mitigation.\"</p><p>As executive director of Living Lakes Canada, Hartwig works to build capacity for community-based water monitoring and fill the gaps in provincial data.</p><p>\"We're also helping to educate and build a water-literate constituency, so people understand that groundwater is a treasure and not to be wasted,\" she says.</p><p>There were just two groundwater observation wells in the Columbia Basin when Living Lakes began monitoring in 2017, she says. Today, there are more than 30. Last year they registered some of the lowest water levels, Hartwig adds.</p><p>In 2021, Living Lakes launched an open-access hub to bring water-related data from the Columbia region together in one place from sources including local governments, First Nations, community groups and the private sector.</p><p>But the experts say it's just scratching the surface of what's needed.</p><p>'HALF A CENTURY OF NEGLECT'</p><p>B.C. has regulated surface water for more than a century, but before the Water Sustainability Act came into force in 2016, that wasn't the case for groundwater, says Wei, who helped the province develop the legislation.</p><p>Before 2016, he says, landowners could drill next to a stream and pump groundwater, potentially depleting surface water, without provincial knowledge.</p><p>That's changing, but Wei says B.C. is \"dealing with half a century of neglect.\"</p><p>He says B.C. has mapped 1,200 aquifers with about 240 observation wells, most on the South Coast and in the southern Interior.</p><p>But much of the mapping is \"rudimentary\" and monitoring infrastructure inadequate, Wei says. It often doesn't tell officials how much water is being used, which direction it's flowing, and what the sustainable supply from an aquifer might be.</p><p>Cullen says he \"always (wants) more data,\" and the province is expanding monitoring sites.</p><p>\"I think increasingly, there's an understanding from water users and the general public that we're into an era where we're going to have to be a lot more precise and inclusive when we make decisions around water, especially groundwater use.\"</p><p>B.C. has been working to bring people who use groundwater into the licensing system introduced with the 2016 legislation. The province offered existing users a six-year transition period to obtain a licence with the date recognizing their first use of the groundwater.</p><p>The date is crucial because licences showing newer usage are the first to be cut off during water scarcity under the \"first in time, first in right\" system, says Brandes,who leads the POLIS Water Sustainability Project at the University of Victoria.</p><p>Yet the province received just 7,700 applications from some 20,000 existing non-domestic users by the time the transition ended.</p><p>Those who didn't register may face a \"rude awakening,\" Brandes says.</p><p>\"In a few places, there is basically not enough water,\" he says. \"The people who ... weren't signed up in the transition period are going to be in a tough spot.\"</p><p>They can still apply for a licence moving forward, but it would no longer reflect when they first began using groundwater, Brandes says.</p><p>Cullen says sign-ups came in \"dramatically\" below what officials had hoped for and what the province needs to manage water.</p><p>\"It's difficult to manage if you're not properly measuring,\" the minister says.</p><p>\"We're trying to broadly understand the resistance to people getting licensed and to lower (it),\" he says, adding things are \"trending in the right direction.\"</p><p>\"We're understanding the full actual nature of it in a much better way than we did, say, five years ago,\" he says.</p><p>But Brandes says the slow progress and general lack of \"vital signs\" about water in B.C. led to a \"disaster\" last summer, when critically low flows in several waterways prompted the province to issue fish protection orders that restricted the irrigation of forage crops in parts of the southern Interior.</p><p>The orders cut off several hundred surface and groundwater users and some ranchers resorted to selling livestock as they grappled with the shortage of feed.</p><p>Brandes says the province's handling of the situation contributed to uncertainty, social conflict, and a loss of public trust.</p><p>Wei, too, says the orders lacked transparency. \"People didn't know why they were being shut off. Science wasn't necessarily getting out there.\"</p><p>He says a lack of proactive investment in understanding water and building capacity to respond to drought leads to \"scrambling\" in the face of urgent situations, and scrambling is costly, financially and democratically.</p><p>\"When you don't have information, it's not transparent, you erode public confidence in what you, the administrator for the resource, can do.\" he says.</p><p>\"And when you start eroding it, you're eroding your democratic foundation.\"</p><p>The conversation in the Interior last summer \"went badly,\" Cullen says, adding that restrictions are \"the last thing\" the government wants.</p><p>\"Coming together is the path forward, and that's what we're doing. That's why we're having those conversations in 20-plus communities already.\"</p><p>Hartwig says the work in the Columbia Basin serves as a template and underscores the importance of community-led water monitoring and governance.</p><p>The project has uncovered streams that were \"over-allocated\" with licences, she says, as well as dry areas where government maps indicated high-elevation wetlands.</p><p>Yet she says three dozen community-based groups in the Columbia region have been forced to stop their work due to funding cuts in recent years.</p><p>\"We have a huge amount of attrition of these small, volunteer-based water monitoring groups who are very concerned about their own watersheds,\" she says. </p><p>\"We need those boots on the ground. We need that level of water literacy, and we need them to participate in civil society, right? We can't have that eroded.</p><p>\"And that's not being fortified by the province.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 9, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-874e7339b7d243e6b8bc9825d366827c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BS5-J4C1-DY9S-T0K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1533\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was located on the eastern shore of Length Lake and reached 0.4 hectares in size.<br/><br/> At 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 2, there were two new  wildland fires confirmed in the Northeast Region. Algonquin Park 9 was being held at 0.4 of a hectare at that time. North Bay 19 had already been declared out after being confirmed at 3:09 p.m. that same day. It measured 0.1 of a hectare and was located along the southwestern shore of Lady Evelyn Lake. <br/><br/><br/><br/> There was one other active wildland fire in the Northeast Region at that time, in the Bancroft area, and it was under control. At 1:44 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 3, it is now out.<br/><br/> The fire hazard is low to moderate across the entire Northeast Region, except for an area located around Bissett Creek and southward, including a portion of Algonquin Park, that is showing a high hazard Thursday afternoon.<br/><br/> The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating is currently set to moderate and in Almaguin, North Bay area, the fire danger rating is also moderate.<br/><br/> You can view past and current wildfires from 2022 and their location in the map below.

When you fly a drone near a forest fire, you can put the lives of pilots, firefighters and other emergency personnel at risk. Be safe, stay clear of forest fires.<br/><br/> Also, if you are in a watercraft, a reminder to steer clear of waterbombers. When waterbombers approach a body of water, move close to the shore so they can perform their scoop safely. A waterbomber will not scoop from a lake or river if encroaching watercraft pose a safety hazard. <br/><br/> Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services would like to remind the public to use caution when performing any outdoor burning. In order to dispose of yard waste and woody debris, we encourage you to use methods such as composting or using your local landfill. If you must burn, follow Ontario's Outdoor Burning Regulations. <br/><br/> Fires are to be ignited no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise. Always have tools/water adequate to contain the fire at the site. Know the rules for safe outdoor burning. Consult the full set of Outdoor Burning Regulations. <br/><br/> To report a wildland fire located north of the French and Mattawa rivers, please dial 310-FIRE. To report a forest fire located south of the French or Mattawa rivers, please dial 911. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2022080565202440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:663F-GSR1-JDV5-F53M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Evacuation orders for other communities were issued in the following days.</p><p>On May 29, Nova Scotia\u2019s fires spun out of control, in a fashion that experts said was an ominous signal for the rest of Canada. \u201cIf Halifax can burn, any place can burn, and that blows all our minds,\u201d said John Vaillant, author of the award-winning \u201cFire Weather: The Making of a Beast.\u201d</p><p>A heat dome and tinder-dry forests fed the blaze on the outskirts of the Nova Scotia capital. Homeowners, startled by the rapidity of the spread, encountered traffic jams attempting to flee their neighbourhoods.</p><p>On June 8, during debate in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \u201cCanada is burning.\u201d</p><p>And the impact was not confined within our borders. Quebec's lightning-sparked wildfires made international news as the smoke travelled south, giving Toronto among the worst air quality in the world and forcing the cancellation of Major League Baseball games as far away as Washington, D.C.</p><p>Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency estimated that more than 700 fires burned about 51,000 square kilometres of land, more than the province had ever recorded in a single season.</p><p>Fires also ravaged the North. About 70 per cent of the population of the Northwest Territories were at some point displaced during the wildfire season. When flames threatened Yellowknife, the capital's 20,000 residents were ordered out on Aug. 16. People waited in line at the airport for flights while others set off on marathon road trips to Alberta and other regions.</p><p>Flames came close but did not enter the city, and after three weeks, residents were allowed to return. The territorial election, less than a month away, was pushed to November.</p><p>Meanwhile, British Columbia also suffered its worst wildfire season on record, with about 400 homes destroyed and more than 2.8 million hectares burned.</p><p>Fires stoked by drought conditions and howling winds swept down late at night on West Kelowna on the shores of Okanagan Lake in mid-August, making it the centre of the unfolding emergency.</p><p>The fires caused tragic loss: six firefighters in B.C. died, including four killed in a road crash as they returned home from a two-week deployment.</p><p>And there were also stories of selflessness, including the efforts of volunteer firefighters such as Mark Zawidzki. He helped extinguish the flames approaching neighbours\u2019 houses in a Halifax suburb as his own burned a few kilometres away. \u201cI just wanted to save somebody else\u2019s house while I could,\u201d Zawidzki told The Canadian Press.</p><p>Thousands of Canadians suffered long-term economic loss, and began an exhausting odyssey of rebuilding their lives after everything from wedding photos to cars went up in flames.</p><p>\"Typically, wildfire season has been isolated as a British Columbia problem with spillover into Alberta. But 2023 proved wildfires are now a national problem and a harbinger of Canada's new normal,\" said Dawn Walton, managing editor of CTV Calgary.</p><p>\"Wildfires will intensify as climate change increases. It will soon become the biggest story in the land,\" commented Richard Dooley, supervising producer of Global News in Nova Scotia.</p><p>Thirty-five per cent of the 97 survey respondents chose wildfires as story of the year. Inflation was the second choice at 25 per cent.</p><p>As the year came to an end, the University of Waterloo\u2019sIntact Centre on Climate Adaptation said the experience of 2023 will be repeated unless Canadian governments and citizens make significant investments in prevention.</p><p>\u201cAccording to historical records, current wildfire seasons start roughly one week earlier and end one week later than 70 years ago,\u201d the centre said in a report released Monday.</p><p>Matt Goerzen, managing editor of the Brandon Sun, noted that discussion of the wildfires reflected the sometimes divisive nature of the climate change debate in Canada.</p><p>\"These discussions became overly heated during the summer of wildfires that claimed large swaths of Canadian forests, and forced an entire city, Yellowknife, to evacuate,\" he wrote. \"I fear we will only see more of these kinds of stories in the coming years.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 20, 2023.</p><p>Note to readers: This is a corrected story.

There are gaps in mapping and other data that officials need to effectively manage water during times of scarcity.</p><p>The province doesn't keep track of exact usage by most groundwater licence holders, the Ministry of Land, Water and Resource Stewardship confirmed. Rather, the licence sets the maximum amount of water each user can extract.</p><p>That's the case for both domestic and some commercial users,including companies in the forestry, mining, and agricultural sectors, the ministry says.</p><p>At the same time, about two-thirds of pre-existing users have yet to even apply for licences since B.C. first began regulating groundwater in 2016.</p><p>The B.C. Energy Regulator publishes quarterly water-use reports for the oil and gas sector, and some other licensees may be required to report how much they use. Groundwater users may also be asked to complete a \"beneficial use\" declaration to show they're meeting licence terms.</p><p>But it's an incomplete picture of water use throughout the province at a time when signs point to deepening drought.</p><p>Hartwig, as well as Oliver Brandes, a lawyer and policy expert at the University of Victoria, and hydrogeologist Mike Wei, who retired from working for the province in 2018, say B.C. lacks sufficient mapping and details on groundwater sources.</p><p>B.C.'s minister for land, water and resource stewardship, Nathan Cullen, says drought wasn't always front of mind for B.C. governments and the public.</p><p>\"If there were worries (about) water, historically, there was often too much, right?\"</p><p>Cullen's fledgling ministry is now tasked with catching up to today's climate reality and delivering the province's watershed security strategy, expected sometime this year.</p><p>An intentions paper shows priority areas include enhancing monitoring and addressing data gaps.</p><p>The B.C.-First Nations Water Table is co-developing the strategy, and Cullen says the province is working to establish additional community-based groups this spring.</p><p>Many of those tables involve members of the agricultural sector, he says, pointing to the recent announcement of $80 million in additional funding for the province's agricultural water infrastructure program to help farmers weather times of drought.</p><p>\"The scope and scale of the challenges is real to my mind,\" Cullen says.</p><p>But \"standing up what may be dozens and dozens of these community water tables in short order \u2026 is very much in the government's interest,\" he says.</p><p>\"This costs us one way or the other,\" the minister adds. \"Better water management is a lot cheaper than the management of crisis, similar to forest fire mitigation.\"</p><p>As executive director of Living Lakes Canada, Hartwig works to build capacity for community-based water monitoring and fill the gaps in provincial data.</p><p>\"We're also helping to educate and build a water-literate constituency, so people understand that groundwater is a treasure and not to be wasted,\" she says.</p><p>There were just two groundwater observation wells in the Columbia Basin when Living Lakes began monitoring in 2017, she says. Today, there are more than 30. Last year they registered some of the lowest water levels, Hartwig adds.</p><p>In 2021, Living Lakes launched an open-access hub to bring water-related data from the Columbia region together in one place from sources including local governments, First Nations, community groups and the private sector.</p><p>But the experts say it's just scratching the surface of what's needed.</p><p>'HALF A CENTURY OF NEGLECT'</p><p>B.C. has regulated surface water for more than a century, but before the Water Sustainability Act came into force in 2016, that wasn't the case for groundwater, says Wei, who helped the province develop the legislation.</p><p>Before 2016, he says, landowners could drill next to a stream and pump groundwater, potentially depleting surface water, without provincial knowledge.</p><p>That's changing, but Wei says B.C. is \"dealing with half a century of neglect.\"</p><p>He says B.C. has mapped 1,200 aquifers with about 240 observation wells, most on the South Coast and in the southern Interior.</p><p>But much of the mapping is \"rudimentary\" and monitoring infrastructure inadequate, Wei says. It often doesn't tell officials how much water is being used, which direction it's flowing, and what the sustainable supply from an aquifer might be.</p><p>Cullen says he \"always (wants) more data,\" and the province is expanding monitoring sites.</p><p>\"I think increasingly, there's an understanding from water users and the general public that we're into an era where we're going to have to be a lot more precise and inclusive when we make decisions around water, especially groundwater use.\"</p><p>B.C. has been working to bring people who use groundwater into the licensing system introduced with the 2016 legislation. The province offered existing users a six-year transition period to obtain a licence with the date recognizing their first use of the groundwater.</p><p>The date is crucial because licences showing newer usage are the first to be cut off during water scarcity under the \"first in time, first in right\" system, says Brandes,who leads the POLIS Water Sustainability Project at the University of Victoria.</p><p>Yet the province received just 7,700 applications from some 20,000 existing non-domestic users by the time the transition ended.</p><p>Those who didn't register may face a \"rude awakening,\" Brandes says.</p><p>\"In a few places, there is basically not enough water,\" he says. \"The people who \u2026 weren't signed up in the transition period are going to be in a tough spot.\"</p><p>They can still apply for a licence moving forward, but it would no longer reflect when they first began using groundwater, Brandes says.</p><p>Cullen says sign-ups came in \"dramatically\" below what officials had hoped for and what the province needs to manage water.</p><p>\"It's difficult to manage if you're not properly measuring,\" the minister says.</p><p>\"We're trying to broadly understand the resistance to people getting licensed and to lower (it),\" he says, adding things are \"trending in the right direction.\"</p><p>\"We're understanding the full actual nature of it in a much better way than we did, say, five years ago,\" he says.</p><p>But Brandes says the slow progress and general lack of \"vital signs\" about water in B.C. led to a \"disaster\" last summer, when critically low flows in several waterways prompted the province to issue fish protection orders that restricted the irrigation of forage crops in parts of the southern Interior.</p><p>The orders cut off several hundred surface and groundwater users and some ranchers resorted to selling livestock as they grappled with the shortage of feed.</p><p>Brandes says the province's handling of the situation contributed to uncertainty, social conflict, and a loss of public trust.</p><p>Wei, too, says the orders lacked transparency. \"People didn't know why they were being shut off. Science wasn't necessarily getting out there.\"</p><p>He says a lack of proactive investment in understanding water and building capacity to respond to drought leads to \"scrambling\" in the face of urgent situations, and scrambling is costly, financially and democratically.</p><p>\"When you don't have information, it's not transparent, you erode public confidence in what you, the administrator for the resource, can do.\" he says.</p><p>\"And when you start eroding it, you're eroding your democratic foundation.\"</p><p>The conversation in the Interior last summer \"went badly,\" Cullen says, adding that restrictions are \"the last thing\" the government wants.</p><p>\"Coming together is the path forward, and that's what we're doing. That's why we're having those conversations in 20-plus communities already.\"</p><p>Hartwig says the work in the Columbia Basin serves as a template and underscores the importance of community-led water monitoring and governance.</p><p>The project has uncovered streams that were \"over-allocated\" with licences, she says, as well as dry areas where government maps indicated high-elevation wetlands.</p><p>Yet she says three dozen community-based groups in the Columbia region have been forced to stop their work due to funding cuts in recent years.</p><p>\"We have a huge amount of attrition of these small, volunteer-based water monitoring groups who are very concerned about their own watersheds,\" she says.</p><p>\"We need those boots on the ground. We need that level of water literacy, and we need them to participate in civil society, right? We can't have that eroded.</p><p>\"And that's not being fortified by the province.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: B.C.'s Sunshine Coast declares state of emergency over drought</p><p>READ ALSO: B.C. farms, industry risk losing water rights as licence deadline nears</p><p>Copyright 2024 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20240410PAB4590680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BS7-DXT1-F0HF-801N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Group Ltd.

(MAX Power or the Company) announces that Prospectair Geosurveys of Gatineau, Quebec, has resumed a high resolution heliborne radiometric and magnetic survey covering the Companys Corvette Lake North and Corvette Lake South properties in James Bay, in close proximity to Patriot Battery Metals Corvette deposit and covering a total area of approximately 100 sq. km (see Figure 1, Location Map).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAX Power initially commenced the airborne survey in late June (refer to June 21, 2023 news release) and work was paused shortly thereafter, due to forest fire restrictions in the region. On June 26, the company announced that it had outlined multiple radiometric anomalies at and around the newly-identified Shoreline Zone from preliminary airborne survey data covering approximately two-thirds of Corvette Lake North. MAX Power eagerly awaits a detailed analysis of the Corvette Lake North Survey upon its final completion in the coming days, ahead of ground operations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Figure 1 - Location Map</p><p>Mr. Rav Mlait, MAX Power CEO, commented: Corvette Lake North and Corvette Lake South have become increasingly interesting to our geological team in recent months based on further reviews of historical information and preliminary interpretations from the early part of the airborne survey before it was interrupted by the forest fire threat. This summer, we have seen significant corporate activities in this area including the entrance of Rio Tinto, next to MAX Power (1), and investment by Albemarle into Patriot Battery Metals (2). Were excited to resume this work at our Corvette Lake properties in advance of field operations.</p><p>Mr. Mlait added, The recent news that Ford and SK, a Korean battery manufacturer, are planning to build a new $1.2 billion battery cathode factory in Becancour, Quebec (3) is another reason our Canadian lithium division is focused exclusively on this province with our strategic position in the James Bay Lithium Camp and ownership of one of the largest land positions focused on lithium in Nunavik, covering the top third of Quebec, where an exploration program is ongoing.</p><p>Management cautions that mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby properties is not necessarily indicative of the presence of similar mineralization or geology on the Company's properties.</p><p>Prospectair Geosurveys is acquiring detailed information on Corvette Lake North and Corvette Lake South using 50-metre line spacing. The tight line spacing is an important factor in interpreting structures and rock formations, especially where rocks are not outcropping.</p><p>References: //st (1) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/azimut-and-rio-tinto-sign-agreements-\">https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/azimut-and-rio-tinto-sign-agreements-</url> for-the-corvet-and-kaanaayaa-lithium-properties-james-bay-region-quebec-888 177804.html (2) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/albemarle-invest-about-83-mln-p\">https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/albemarle-invest-about-83-mln-p</url> atriot-battery-metals-5-stake-2023-07-31/ (3) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2023/\">https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2023/</url> 08/fords-turn-to-choose-becancour.html</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Peter Lauder, P.Geo., Member of the Order of Geologists of Quebec and Senior Geologist and Exploration Manager for MAX Power Mining Corp.

residents of Fort Albany has shifted to Kapuskasing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, the remote community was evacuated due to a nearby forest fire. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Things shifted in the delivery of services over the weekend, and Kapuskasing\u2019s CAO Guylain Baril said that the long-time partnership between their community and leadership from Fort Albany has resumed at the request of Chief Elizabeth Kataquapit.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cTo change hands in the middle of an evacuation, regardless of who it is that was involved or is getting involved, there is some chaos,\u201d said Baril. \u201cWe are trying to make it as seamless as possible for the evacuees.\u201d </p><p>While Missanabie Cree First Nation's ISN Maskwa had been co-ordinating the efforts during the initial evacuation, that role has changed over to the town. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re willing to play a role in the town of Kap, or Val Rita, or anywhere in the province where they can be received,\u201d said Joe Tom Sayers, the general manager at Missanabie Cree Business Corporation. </p><p>On Friday, June 23, the Town of Kapuskasing issued a press release saying that they had been pushed out of the evacuation planning process. </p><p>On Monday, June 26 Missanabie Cree First Nation Chief Jason Gauthier responded with a news release claiming the town would not work with them and clarifying what ISN Maskwa is and what their goals are. </p><p>Sayers said the company reached out to the city to come to an agreement. </p><p>\u201cWe have attempted to engage with the town since last fall,\u201d said Sayers. \u201cWe weren\u2019t successful in coming to terms with the town.\u201d </p><p>This lack of communication came to a head when a plane carrying people from Fort Albany First Nation was stuck on the tarmac at the Kapuskasing airport, unable to disembark, said Sayers. </p><p>Sayers said they offered to put their staff in place to assist those who needed it to disembark safely. </p><p>\u201cWe asked if we could have our folks meet them on the tarmac, so we can ensure they get safely on the bus on the tarmac,\u201d said Sayers. \u201cThey said no, you don\u2019t have the training, we won\u2019t allow that.\u201d </p><p>Baril said that the town offered help. </p><p>\u201cAirside assistance is not a service our airport offers,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually the airlines provide that service, but during evacuations, the town of Kap has staff that they deploy because we\u2019re getting larger airplanes that require that assistance.\u201d </p><p>Baril said that service was not something they were willing to offer. </p><p>\u201cThis was essentially the only role we were going to play and it was decided by council that if that was the only value that the ISC sees Kapuskasing playing, then we\u2019re not interested in that,\u201d he said.  </p><p>The plane was eventually rerouted to Cochrane where the passengers got off the plane and boarded a bus to go back to Kapuskasing. </p><p>Sayers said that the focus should not be on the politics behind who does what in these situations. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a reliable partner in the town of Kap,\u201d said Sayers. </p><p>He said that they\u2019ve built partnerships with service providers in Kapuskasing, including the friendship centre. </p><p>ISN Maskwa has been working with Indigenous Services Canada and First Nations across the province in emergency situations since 2021. </p><p>It also provides securities, policing and emergency services training to First Nations across the province. </p><p>ISC spokesperson Randy Legault-Rankin said that their work with ISN Maskwa filled a gap many First Nations saw in the services ISC was providing. </p><p>\"For many years, Ontario First Nations that have been asking for an Indigenous-led approach to emergency management,\" said Legault-Rankin. \"As part of our approach to reconciliation and supporting a true nation-to-nation relationship between First Nations and the Government of Canada ISC is transferring service delivery to First Nations and Indigenous organizations is a key part of our mandate.\" </p><p>Sayers said that ISN Maskwa is filling that gap. </p><p>\u201cWe really believe in First Nations helping First Nations,\u201d said Sayers. \u201cWe provide an alternative to First Nations with a First Nations workforce.\u201d </p><p>The company has partnerships with many host cities and is in the process of building an 800-person capacity shelter on their reserve lands, which is planned to open in 2024. </p><p>\u201cOur priority is the safety of the community of Fort Albany, and we respect the chief\u2019s decision,\u201d said Sayers. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously trying to help her community in a time of crisis.\u201d </p><p>Baril said the focus is on the evacuees and the Town of Kapuskasing will put their energy into this situation. </p><p>\u201cThe focus is really on making sure the evacuees have what they need,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, I\u201dm sure the First Nation is feeling the divide, but we\u2019ll try to minimize that as best we can.\u201d </p><p>ISC said that as of 4:30 pm on Thursday, 380 people from Fort Albany First Nation have been evacuated to Kapuskasing, and 100 have been sent to Timmins. </p><p>The fire \u2014 Cochrane 11 \u2014that pushed residents from their homes is now being held, says Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES). It's estimated to be 805 hectares in size and FireRanger crews are making good progress to suppress it. </p><p>TimminsToday has reached out to Fort Albany First Nation leadership about these issues did not receive a response by the the time of publication.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8aeae6e29796483caccfb14796705391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KK-TNJ1-JBVR-325R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><timeReceived>02:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 30, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTQzMTg1Rjc4OUNGNDgxRkI4Qzk2QzBEODQwQTRENDc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc0QkUxRjIwOENFNDFFM0IyRjk2QzZCRjNCMjkwODU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He was assisted by the PAAC\u2019s marketing professional, Jennifer Layman. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Wren explained the presentation to WWR was the first in what is hoped to be an annual initiative to update the municipalities which own the airport, including WW, Laurentian Valley, the City of Pembroke, the Town of Petawawa, Deep River, Laurentian Hills, and Garrison Petawawa. The PAAC is made up of representatives of the municipalities which share ownership of the facility.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis is the first of the owner-municipalities that we\u2019re doing a presentation to, so you are our guinea pigs,\u201d he told council.  </p><p>Using a \u201ctrivia quiz\u201d format, Ms. Layman highlighted a variety of ways in which the airport serves its owners and the wider community. </p><p>\u201cThe first flight to land there in 2023 was an international air ambulance transporting a local resident who had fallen ill in St. Lucia,\u201d she said. \u201cORNG air ambulance service is very busy with us, as we back up three hospitals. But it\u2019s important to note that we also handle international air travel. Any local resident who falls ill outside of Canada comes back to us. We are a certified airport, which is a big plus in making it possible for us to handle those things.\u201d </p><p>Council learned the airport serves a vital role in forest firefighting. </p><p>\u201cThis past June, Calabogie-Griffith had a pretty significant forest fire, and even though there are airports closer to them, the staff here were able to meet the needs of the Ministry of Natural Resources forest firefighting crew more easily,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fuel upgrades you, as the owners, have made in the system, ensured that the base of the operation was handled out of our airport. If the airport were not here, would fire-related aviation still happen? Yes, it would, but it would take longer, and we all know that in a fire, time is of the essence.\u201d </p><p>A recent user of the airport was the president of Jamaica. </p><p>\u201cHe flew into Hamilton, Ontario, with a delegation and then flew up to Pembroke with a whole bunch of people who then went to CNL for the day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would count as a corporate flight, of which we have about 200 a year. What\u2019s good for us is, they pay a landing fee, and they often refuel when they land, so that\u2019s revenue for us in two ways, but also helps us make a connection with the world.\u201d  </p><p>A Department of National Defence (DND) exercise in the fall of 2023 was a major contributor to airport revenue. </p><p>\u201cIt was a huge project,\u201d said Ms. Layman. \u201cDND purchased 630,000 litres of fuel. Without this exercise, our total fuel sales for the year would have been 165,000 litres. This brought us to a higher level with DND in terms of things that we can provide for them at the airport. We can facilitate a massive six-week exercise like this. They are our biggest user today, and they have been for a long time.  </p><p>\u201cWe have slowly been adding more to what we can do to help them, and this was a big step for us. As we strengthen our relationship with DND, it allows us to connect in other ways, through different businesses such as a skydiving business being established now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe always say \u2018yes\u2019 to everything and then figure out how to do it.\u201d </p><p>The airport is a vital link in the development of cutting-edge technology. </p><p> \u201cLast year a gentleman flew in from Saskatchewan in his own aircraft with an MRI machine he had invented that would work in space,\u201d she said. \u201cHe, too, was going to CNL where they did some checking on this device.\u201d </p><p>Running the airport isn\u2019t a 9-to-5 job. There were 55 emergency callouts for airport staff outside of regular operating hours of 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. last year, said Ms. Layman. </p><p>\u201cThese were situations where time was of the essence, such as air ambulance or OPP search and rescue,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is an 800 number they can call, and staff will go out at midnight or 2 or 3 a.m. to help them refuel or let them into the building \u2013 whatever needs to be done.\u201d </p><p>People don\u2019t go fishing at an airport,  she said, but the PAA is  a vital link for the MNR when they stock 57 lakes and rivers all across Renfrew County with almost 100,000 fish, an activity that is run out of the airport. Further, it\u2019s a transportation link for fishing tourism. </p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of connections you don\u2019t even think about,\u201d she said.  </p><p>She highlighted a little-known community service using the airport. </p><p>\u201cBearskin Airlines provides transportation at no charge weekly for children with vision and hearing impairments to a school in Southern Ontario where they learn to live well with their impairments, eventually graduating from high school there,\u201d Ms. Layman explained. </p><p>She encouraged council members as airport owners to spread the word about the services it makes possible.  </p><p>\u201cFor example, it can be a tool for tourism services to promote charter opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe airport itself does not have a charter service, but it will facilitate charter services. Coming from Toronto it\u2019s easy because there are a lot of charter services based there.\u201d </p><p>She urged council members to promote the airport.  </p><p>\u201cYou, the owners, are to be commended for having to foresight to be invested in this facility,\u201d she said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t encourage your partners around the table, or even the county, to do the same. This is a county-wide regional airport. </p><p>She added the airport has reasonably-priced meeting space for rent for uses ranging from interviews to a job fair.  </p><p>Councillor Mike Moore asked Ms. Layman to elaborate on the OPP\u2019s and Suret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s use of the airport.  </p><p>\u201cThe OPP uses it for surveillance and fugitive search and capture,\u201d she said. </p><p> She noted that a prime example of that was the capture of triple-murderer Basil Borutski, which was facilitated at the PAAC. </p><p>\u201cThe gentleman in charge of that operation said that being able to operate so closely there probably saved at least one other life that day,\u201d she said.  </p><p>She said that emergency situations such as that are challenging to discuss because they often cannot be discussed publicly when they are happening. </p><p>Situations involving lost or injured tourists in Qu\u00e9bec, which does not have an air ambulance service, are often co-ordinated out of the PAA.  </p><p>Councillor Joe Trimm expressed his appreciation for the presentation. </p><p>\u201cAnnually I and the other councillors have to make a decision with respect to budget,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is good to be reminded of why we continue to support the airport with our taxpayer dollars.\u201d  </p><p>She noted that during discussions and lobbying with various government departments, it came up time and again the airport is not operating in the red. </p><p>\u201cNobody could believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is another airport that operates in the black, but we have, and we do, and that is highly unusual for an airport that receives zero government funds. The big airports that get lots of money don\u2019t operate in the black. They are a drain on their communities. We are not. The municipal owners contribute 15 per cent of our budget. The remaining 85 per cent, we make ourselves.\u201d  </p><p>The last time the PAA received federal money was in 1995. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-cc84e7b77ee04ebe87f3b837201188ea</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJD-B3M1-JBVR-32KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><timeReceived>02:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 13, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8</p><p>\\x95 Artesian Drive, between

It was thought poor air quality may have persisted into Saturday for some areas.</p><p>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW</p><p>NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE</p><p>According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.</p><p>You might be interested in</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Related Stories</p><p>Muskoka Fire Danger Rating 2023</p><p>Restricted Fire Zone order in effect June 1 for Muskoka, Parry Sound, Almaguin</p><p>Are you prepared in case of a wildfire Parry Sound-Muskoka?</p><p>UPDATE: Larger Algonquin Park fire now 'under control,' while other 'being held'</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution.

It was thought poor air quality may persist into Saturday for some areas. <br/><br/> NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE<br/><br/> According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.<br/><br/> To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060968146511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F4-HNG1-JDV5-F0FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

But what about those who have no indoors to go to?</p><p><br/><br/> Jennifer Van Gennip, director of communication and advocacy for Redwood Park Communities, said there's no easy answer for those experiencing homelessness.<br/><br/> \"This air-quality warning takes me back to our early COVID days ... What are you supposed to do when the advice is to stay in your home, and you don't have a home?\" she said in an email to Simcoe.com. \"And what are the government's obligations to people when warnings are issued to cease outdoor activities and get inside due to health risks?\"<br/><br/> During a Barrie council meeting June 7, Dr. Charles Gardner, medical officer of health for the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit, said smoke and haze brought about by the fires in Quebec can have a big impact on everyone's health, but some more than others. <br/><br/> \"With a poor air quality, everybody's health is put at risk, but particularly people who are vulnerable, people who are older or very young, or those who have pre-existing medical conditions, respiratory conditions, heart conditions,\" he said. \"The advice right now is to reduce your exposure to the outdoor air. That's difficult to do, of course, since we are obliged to go out.\"<br/><br/> \"We know that many of our unhoused neighbours already have compromised health, and the risk to them is elevated,\" pointed out Van Gennip. \"My hope is that, as these types of disruptions become more common, we figure out how to provide immediate assistance.<br/><br/> \"It further underscores the urgency to make sure everyone in our community has a safe, affordable, hopeful place to call home.\"<br/><br/> Environment Canada has indicated that poor air quality across most of Simcoe County may continue into the weekend. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060868136029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DX-JBN1-JDV5-F09M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(\"Trican\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its second quarter results for 2024. The following news release should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\"), the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as well as the Annual Information Form (\"AIF\") for the year ended December 31, 2023. All of these documents are available on SEDAR+ at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS //st * Trican's results for the second quarter compared to the prior year period improved with an increase in operating activity resulting in improvements in all major financial categories:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Revenue was $211.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a 26% increase compared to $168.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>* Adjusted EBITDAS1 and adjusted EBITDA1 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $45.2 million and $40.7 million, compared to $32.9 million and $31.9 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>* Free cash flow1 and free cash flow per share1 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $20.9 million, $0.10 per share basic and diluted compared to $20.2 million, $0.09 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>* Profit and profit per share for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $16.2 million, $0.08 per share basic and diluted compared to $9.8 million, $0.05 per share basic and $0.04 per share diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2023. * The Company's balance sheet remains strong with positive working capital, including cash, of $148.4 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $153.2 million at December 31, 2023, providing significant financial flexibility. As at June 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $36.0 million (December 31, 2023 - $88.8 million). The decrease in cash is the result of working capital requirements, tax installments, capital expenditures and return of capital initiatives. As at June 30, 2024, the Company had no loans and borrowings (December 31, 2023 - nil).</p><p>OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHT</p><p>On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into a partnership with Source Energy Services Ltd. to construct a new sand transloading facility (the \"Facility\") in The District of Taylor, British Columbia. The Facility will be unit train capable and feature approximately 55,000 tonnes of storage and greater than 12,000 tonnes of daily throughput capacity when completed, making it one of the largest facilities in northeast British Columbia. Construction of the Facility will commence in late July of 2024 with the first phase expected to be operational in late Q3 2024 with full completion anticipated in early 2025. The Facility will provide improved sand access to the region and allow Trican to better service its clients in northeast British Columbia.</p><p>RETURN OF CAPITAL //st * The Company continues to be active in its Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\") program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:</p><p>* During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, Trican purchased and cancelled 6,158,400 common shares at a weighted average price of $4.42 per share, or approximately 3% of the Company's outstanding shares at December 31, 2023. Subsequent to June 30, 2024 the Company purchased an additional 2,438,100 common shares, bringing total purchases under the 2023-2024 NCIB program to 15,258,429 common shares.</p><p>* On October 2, 2023, the Company announced the renewal of its NCIB program, commencing October 5, 2023, to purchase up to 21,004,897 common shares for cancellation before October 4, 2024, subject to the TSX NCIB rules.</p><p>* Since the initiation of our NCIB programs in 2017, Trican has purchased 158,638,182 common shares, equating to approximately 46% of total shares outstanding at the start of the NCIB programs. All common shares purchased under the NCIB are returned to treasury for cancellation. * The Company continues to execute on its return of capital strategy through a quarterly dividend program:</p><p>* During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.045 per share each quarter, or approximately $18.3 million in aggregate to shareholders.</p><p>* On July 30, 2024, the Company's board of directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share reflecting an increase of 12.5% from the prior year quarterly dividend payments of $0.04 per share. The distribution is scheduled to be made on September 30, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 13, 2024.</p><p>* The dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.</p><p>FINANCIAL REVIEW //st ($ millions, except $ per share amounts.

The Company's capital budget for 2024 remains at approximately $90 million, to be funded with available cash resources, free cash flow1 and our operating line.</p><p>Hydraulic Fracturing Fleet</p><p>We developed our fleet by upgrading existing equipment with CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (\"DGB\") engine technology and building new fully electric ancillary equipment. The combination of Tier 4 DGB engines and fully electric ancillary equipment can displace up to 90% of the diesel used in a conventional fracturing operation with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. Our fracturing fleet upgrades also include industry leading continuous heavy duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies. //st * During the first quarter of 2024, Trican's fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) and second group of electrical ancillary equipment was deployed into the field bringing Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP. Upgrades to the third group of electrical ancillary equipment is underway and expected to be field ready by the end of the year. * Tier 4 upgrades and electric ancillary equipment are key components of Trican's operating strategy. Our ongoing initiatives, including fleet upgrades, are intended to improve operating performance, cost efficiency, and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations while supporting our customers in achieving their productivity goals.</p><p>Financial Position</p><p>We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 and financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including ongoing investment in our industry leading fleet, continued execution of our NCIB program and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Our overall outlook for the next few years remains positive as Canadian market fundamentals continue to be attractive for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing. Additional Canadian oil and natural gas export capacity is now a reality with the expanded Trans Mountain Pipeline in commercial service, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline completed and the LNG Canada project anticipated to start-up in late 2024 or early 2025. Canada's new export capacity will allow our customers to sell oil and natural gas at prices more closely linked to global commodity prices ending our status as having landlocked commodities relying almost solely on US demand and prices. We are also encouraged by the progress being made at other LNG export facilities on the West coast of Canada, as illustrated by the recent positive investment decision for Cedar LNG and the construction progress being made at Woodfibre LNG. Canada's expanded export capacity for oil and natural gas creates a positive backdrop for drilling and completions activity in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, and the associated oilfield services required to develop our resources, through 2024 and beyond. We expect overall annual oilfield activity in Canada to grow modestly allowing us to continue generating attractive returns for our shareholders.</p><p>In particular, the Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta is expected to remain an important North American resource play. We expect that the combination of attractive well economics, increasing demand from LNG export facilities and British Columbia's agreements with First Nations should lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, technically challenging cementing and coiled tubing services, which will support high-volume demand for Trican's core product offerings.</p><p>Although Canadian natural gas prices have remained at or near historical lows to-date in 2024, year-to-date activity has been resilient and almost in line with 2023 levels. We expect the second half of 2024 to remain busy, although not as robust as the second half of 2023. We believe that the liquids content of many natural gas wells and hedges that were put in place are providing attractive economics in spite of low spot prices for natural gas and will support activity levels in the second half of 2024. Many producers and analysts are predicting much improved natural gas prices in 2025.</p><p>Trican's Q2 2024 activity was stronger than anticipated as certain customers accelerated portions of their capital programs to mitigate potential water constraints given the continuing drought conditions expected in Western Canada. Trican continues to work closely with these customers on various solutions including alternative water storage options and utilization of produced water via advanced chemical treatment solutions. Trican is actively monitoring potential access issues related to ongoing forest fire activity throughout Western Canada which could cause temporary delays in our operating areas and will continue to work closely with our customers to minimize business interruptions. We expect no long-term impact to our financial results.</p><p>Trican continues to build on the investments made in our equipment fleet over the last three years with a focus on pressure pumping technology and design. Demand for our energy efficient Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets continues to be robust and is expected to remain strong through the remainder of 2024. Our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB high pressure fracturing equipment containing continuous duty pumps was deployed in the field in early 2024 bringing Trican's total Tier 4 fleet to 210,000 HHP. We continue to invest in and enhance our equipment offering by moving forward with the electrification of certain ancillary equipment required for on-site fracturing operations including the data van, blending, sand handling and other equipment used for fracturing. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers by increasing reliability, reducing emissions and reducing fuel costs. Continued investment in our fleet and electrification program is supported by our free cash flow1 outlook and financial flexibility.</p><p>We remain focused on generating attractive returns for our shareholders and returning capital to them both through our quarterly dividend and our ongoing NCIB program. Trican increased its quarterly dividend per share by 12.5% effective in Q1 2024. We have made significant progress on our NCIB program to date and will look to fully utilize this program prior to its renewal. We believe our ability to deliver a multi-layered return of capital strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet will lead to long-term value creation for our shareholders.</p><p>COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS //st ($ thousands, except total job count, revenue per job and crews; unaudited) Percentage Percentage Percentage Three months ended June 30, 2024 of revenue June 30, 2023 of revenue March 31, 2024 of revenue Revenue 211,811 100% 168,232 100% 271,925 100% Cost of sales Cost of sales 159,611 75% 128,122 76% 189,028 70% Cost of sales - depreciation and amortization 19,033 9% 18,579 11% 18,422 7% Gross profit 33,167 16% 21,531 13% 64,475 24% Administrative expenses 11,498 5% 8,375 5% 10,157 4% Administrative expenses - depreciation 999 -% 954 1% 967 -% Other income (2,791 ) (1%) (831 ) -% (1,522 ) (1%) Results from operating activities 23,461 11% 13,033 8% 54,873 20% Finance costs 510 -% 484 -% 771 -% Foreign exchange loss 135 -% 155 -% 82 -% Profit before income tax 22,816 11% 12,394 7% 54,020 20% Current income tax expense 5,281 2% 2,478 1% 10,767 4% Deferred income tax expense 1,308 1% 77 -% 2,078 1% Profit for the period 16,227 8% 9,839 6% 41,175 15% Adjusted EBITDAS1 45,185 21% 32,946 20% 74,380 27% Adjusted EBITDA1 40,709 19% 31,908 19% 72,801 27% Total job count 1,394 1,337 2,025 Revenue per job 151,945 125,828 134,284 Total proppant pumped (tonnes) 358,000 235,000 386,000 Hydraulic pumping capacity (HHP) 500,000 529,000 525,000 Hydraulic fracturing - active crews 7.0 7.0 7.0 Hydraulic fracturing - parked crews 5.0 5.0 5.0 1 Refer to the Non-GAAP disclosure section of this news release for further details.</p><p>Sales Mix - % of Total Revenue //st Three months ended (unaudited) June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 March 31, 2024 Fracturing 74% 69% 72% Cementing 19% 23% 20% Coiled Tubing 7% 8% 8% Total 100% 100% 100%</p><p>COMPARATIVE YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME STATEMENTS //st ($ thousands, except total job count, revenue per job and crews; unaudited) Percentage Percentage Six months ended June 30, 2024 of revenue June 30, 2023 of revenue Year-over year change Percentage change Revenue 483,736 100% 465,267 100% 18,469 4% Cost of sales Cost of sales 348,639 72% 333,502 72% 15,137 5% Cost of sales - depreciation and amortization 37,455 8% 38,509 8% (1,054 ) (3%) Gross profit 97,642 20% 93,256 20% 4,386 5% Administrative expenses 21,655 4% 18,605 4% 3,050 16% Administrative expenses - depreciation 1,966 -% 1,864 -% 102 5% Other income (4,313 ) (1%) (1,912 ) -% (2,401 ) 126% Results from operating activities 78,334 16% 74,699 16% 3,635 5% Finance costs 1,281 -% 1,429 -% (148 ) (10%) Foreign exchange loss 217 -% 217 -% - -% Profit before income tax 76,836 16% 73,053 16% 3,783 5% Current income tax expense 16,048 3% 17,092 4% (1,044 ) -% Deferred income tax expense 3,386 1% 88 -% 3,298 3,748% Profit for the period 57,402 12% 55,873 12% 1,529 3% Adjusted EBITDAS1 119,565 25% 115,824 25% 3,741 3% Adjusted EBITDA1 113,510 23% 113,539 24% (29 ) -% Total job count 3,419 3,426 Revenue per job 141,485 135,805 Total proppant pumped (tonnes) 744,000 675,000 Hydraulic pumping capacity (HHP) 500,000 529,000 Hydraulic fracturing - active crews 7.0 7.0 Hydraulic fracturing - parked crews 5.0 5.0 1 Refer to the Non-GAAP disclosure section of this news release for further details.</p><p>Sales Mix - % of Total Revenue //st Six months ended (unaudited) June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Fracturing 72% 74% Cementing 20% 19% Coiled Tubing 8% 7% Total 100% 100%</p><p>NON-GAAP MEASURES</p><p>Certain terms in this News Release, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAS, adjusted EBITDA percentage, adjusted EBITDAS percentage and free cash flow, do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and therefore are considered non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAS</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to translate historical variability in the Company's principal business activities into future financial expectations. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, taxation strategy and non-cash charges, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDAS (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation) is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

The Company previously elected to defer its 2023 current income tax installments which was remitted in combination with the 2024 current income tax installments in the period. The Company elected to present current income tax expense as a reduction of free cash flow in the respective period to clearly adjust for the effects of timing and show the impact of such non-discretionary items.</p><p>Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing free cash flow by the Company's basic or diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.</p><p>Free cash flow and free cash flow per share are not standardized measures and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities. //st ($ thousands, unaudited) Three months ended Six months ended</p><p>June 30, June 30, March 31, June 30, June 30,</p><p>2024 2023 2024 2024 2023 Cash flow from / (used in) operations (IFRS financial measure) 86,536 101,270 (37,532 ) 49,004 123,049 Adjustments: Other income (642 ) (449 ) (1,069 ) (1,711 ) (1,197 ) Realized foreign exchange loss 102 450 306 408 398 Current income tax expense (5,281 ) (2,478 ) (10,767 ) (16,048 ) (17,092 ) Maintenance capital expenditures (14,063 ) (8,772 ) (11,460 ) (25,523 ) (19,946 ) Net changes in other liabilities 729 (667 ) (921 ) (3,301 ) - Change in non-cash operating working capital (56,382 ) (69,157 ) 71,622 (25,523 ) (19,946 ) Income taxes paid 9,904 - 39,672 (192 ) 1,265 Free cash flow 20,903 20,197 49,851 70,754 75,119 ($ thousands, unaudited) Three months ended Six months ended</p><p>June 30, June 30, March 31, June 30, June 30,</p><p>2024 2023 2024 2024 2023 Adjusted EBITDA 40,710 31,908 72,801 113,511 113,539 Interest paid (463 ) (461 ) (723 ) (1,186 ) (1,382 ) Current income tax expense (5,281 ) (2,478 ) (10,767 ) (16,048 ) (17,092 ) Maintenance capital expenditures (14,063 ) (8,772 ) (11,460 ) (3,301 ) - Free cash flow 20,903 20,197 49,851 70,754 75,119 ($ thousands, unaudited) Three months ended Six months ended</p><p>June 30, June 30, March 31, June 30, June 30,</p><p>2024 2023 2024 2024 2023 Purchase of property and equipment 25,937 14,419 15,260 41,197 33,908 Growth capital expenditures 11,874 5,647 3,800 15,674 13,962 Maintenance capital expenditures 14,063 8,772 11,460 25,523 19,946 ($ thousands, except $ per share amounts.

(TSX: TCW) (\"Trican\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its second quarter results for 2024. The following news release should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\"), the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as well as the Annual Information Form (\"AIF\") for the year ended December 31, 2023. All of these documents are available on SEDAR+ at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/BpOxLiGZ7Z\">www.sedarplus.ca.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trican's results for the second quarter compared to the prior year period improved with an increase in operating activity resulting in improvements in all major financial categories:</p><p>Revenue was $211.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a 26% increase compared to $168.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDAS1 and adjusted EBITDA1 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $45.2 million and $40.7 million, compared to $32.9 million and $31.9 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>Free cash flow1 and free cash flow per share1 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $20.9 million, $0.10 per share basic and diluted compared to $20.2 million, $0.09 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>Profit and profit per share for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $16.2 million, $0.08 per share basic and diluted compared to $9.8 million, $0.05 per share basic and $0.04 per share diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2023.</p><p>The Company's balance sheet remains strong with positive working capital, including cash, of $148.4 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $153.2 million at December 31, 2023, providing significant financial flexibility. As at June 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $36.0 million (December 31, 2023 - $88.8 million). The decrease in cash is the result of working capital requirements, tax installments, capital expenditures and return of capital initiatives. As at June 30, 2024, the Company had no loans and borrowings (December 31, 2023 - nil).</p><p>OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHT</p><p>On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into a partnership with Source Energy Services Ltd. to construct a new sand transloading facility (the \"Facility\") in The District of Taylor, British Columbia. The Facility will be unit train capable and feature approximately 55,000 tonnes of storage and greater than 12,000 tonnes of daily throughput capacity when completed, making it one of the largest facilities in northeast British Columbia. Construction of the Facility will commence in late July of 2024 with the first phase expected to be operational in late Q3 2024 with full completion anticipated in early 2025. The Facility will provide improved sand access to the region and allow Trican to better service its clients in northeast British Columbia.</p><p>RETURN OF CAPITAL</p><p>The Company continues to be active in its Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\") program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:</p><p>During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, Trican purchased and cancelled 6,158,400 common shares at a weighted average price of $4.42 per share, or approximately 3% of the Company's outstanding shares at December 31, 2023.

The Company's capital budget for 2024 remains at approximately $90 million, to be funded with available cash resources, free cash flow1 and our operating line.</p><p>Hydraulic Fracturing Fleet</p><p>We developed our fleet by upgrading existing equipment with CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (\"DGB\") engine technology and building new fully electric ancillary equipment. The combination of Tier 4 DGB engines and fully electric ancillary equipment can displace up to 90% of the diesel used in a conventional fracturing operation with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. Our fracturing fleet upgrades also include industry leading continuous heavy duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies.</p><p>During the first quarter of 2024, Trican's fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) and second group of electrical ancillary equipment was deployed into the field bringing Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP. Upgrades to the third group of electrical ancillary equipment is underway and expected to be field ready by the end of the year.</p><p>Tier 4 upgrades and electric ancillary equipment are key components of Trican's operating strategy. Our ongoing initiatives, including fleet upgrades, are intended to improve operating performance, cost efficiency, and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations while supporting our customers in achieving their productivity goals.</p><p>Financial Position</p><p>We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 and financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including ongoing investment in our industry leading fleet, continued execution of our NCIB program and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Our overall outlook for the next few years remains positive as Canadian market fundamentals continue to be attractive for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing. Additional Canadian oil and natural gas export capacity is now a reality with the expanded Trans Mountain Pipeline in commercial service, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline completed and the LNG Canada project anticipated to start-up in late 2024 or early 2025. Canada's new export capacity will allow our customers to sell oil and natural gas at prices more closely linked to global commodity prices ending our status as having landlocked commodities relying almost solely on US demand and prices. We are also encouraged by the progress being made at other LNG export facilities on the West coast of Canada, as illustrated by the recent positive investment decision for Cedar LNG and the construction progress being made at Woodfibre LNG. Canada's expanded export capacity for oil and natural gas creates a positive backdrop for drilling and completions activity in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, and the associated oilfield services required to develop our resources, through 2024 and beyond. We expect overall annual oilfield activity in Canada to grow modestly allowing us to continue generating attractive returns for our shareholders.</p><p>In particular, the Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta is expected to remain an important North American resource play. We expect that the combination of attractive well economics, increasing demand from LNG export facilities and British Columbia's agreements with First Nations should lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, technically challenging cementing and coiled tubing services, which will support high-volume demand for Trican's core product offerings.</p><p>Although Canadian natural gas prices have remained at or near historical lows to-date in 2024, year-to-date activity has been resilient and almost in line with 2023 levels. We expect the second half of 2024 to remain busy, although not as robust as the second half of 2023. We believe that the liquids content of many natural gas wells and hedges that were put in place are providing attractive economics in spite of low spot prices for natural gas and will support activity levels in the second half of 2024. Many producers and analysts are predicting much improved natural gas prices in 2025.</p><p>Trican's Q2 2024 activity was stronger than anticipated as certain customers accelerated portions of their capital programs to mitigate potential water constraints given the continuing drought conditions expected in Western Canada. Trican continues to work closely with these customers on various solutions including alternative water storage options and utilization of produced water via advanced chemical treatment solutions. Trican is actively monitoring potential access issues related to ongoing forest fire activity throughout Western Canada which could cause temporary delays in our operating areas and will continue to work closely with our customers to minimize business interruptions. We expect no long-term impact to our financial results.</p><p>Trican continues to build on the investments made in our equipment fleet over the last three years with a focus on pressure pumping technology and design. Demand for our energy efficient Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets continues to be robust and is expected to remain strong through the remainder of 2024. Our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB high pressure fracturing equipment containing continuous duty pumps was deployed in the field in early 2024 bringing Trican's total Tier 4 fleet to 210,000 HHP. We continue to invest in and enhance our equipment offering by moving forward with the electrification of certain ancillary equipment required for on-site fracturing operations including the data van, blending, sand handling and other equipment used for fracturing. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers by increasing reliability, reducing emissions and reducing fuel costs. Continued investment in our fleet and electrification program is supported by our free cash flow1 outlook and financial flexibility.</p><p>We remain focused on generating attractive returns for our shareholders and returning capital to them both through our quarterly dividend and our ongoing NCIB program. Trican increased its quarterly dividend per share by 12.5% effective in Q1 2024. We have made significant progress on our NCIB program to date and will look to fully utilize this program prior to its renewal. We believe our ability to deliver a multi-layered return of capital strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet will lead to long-term value creation for our shareholders.</p><p>COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS</p><p>($ thousands, except total job count, revenue per job and crews;

It was thought poor air quality may persist into Saturday for some areas.</p><p>NOTICE OF HEAVY SMOKE</p><p>According to the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, heavy smoke conditions are occurring in the Northeast Region due to a large number of fires in eastern Ontario and Quebec. Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.</p><p>Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.</p><p>See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.</p><p>Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.</p><p>People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.</p><p>If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.</p><p>Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.</p><p>To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm.</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20230609TMPC2023060968146511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F6-93M1-JDV5-F3PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The wildfires, which stretch from coast to coast, have resulted in roughly 4.4 million hectares of burned land. </p><p><br/><br/> If trends continue, the country could be looking at more scorched forest than has ever been recorded, officials from Natural Resources Canada warned. <br/><br/> As even more fires expected this wildfire season - which lasts until the end of October in Ontario - here's how to keep you and your family safe. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pack a wildfire emergency kit</emphasis><br/><br/> Ensure you have everything you need if you are forced to evacuate by packing an emergency kit. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/making-an-emergency-kit.html\">The Government of Canada</url> says an emergency kit should be easy to carry and that everyone in a household knows where it's located. A kit should include at least two litres of water per day per person, a flashlight, windup radio, first aid kit and non-perishable food items. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Store flammable material away from your home</emphasis><br/><br/> If you live in an area with a wildfire risk, do not store flammable materials near the perimeter of your house, recommends Michelle Laidlaw, associate vice president of national home product and portfolio at The Co-operators. <br/><br/> Bringing a combustible material right outside your house \"can increase the risk of a wildfire doing significant damage to your home,\" she said, noting you should store wood at least 10 metres away from your house. She also said those living in vulnerable areas should keep their lawn trimmed and regularly clear debris, such as branches and leaves around their house. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow all official warnings and emergency evacuation orders</emphasis><br/><br/> During wildfire season, it's especially important to stay on top of all advisories and evacuation orders as fires can start and spread rapidly. When outdoor conditions are extremely dry or if firefighting resources are limited, the Ontario government may enact <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM&amp;locale=en-CA\">a Restricted Fire Zone</url>, prohibiting open fires in certain areas of the province. <br/><br/> It's also imperative to stay informed of any evacuation alerts or orders. The former means you should be prepared to evacuate on short notice, while the latter means you are in danger and should evacuate immediately. <br/><br/> David Arama, a wilderness survival expert, said most townships have post wildfire warning and fire bans on their websites. \"Check with the local townships to find out what the fire danger is,\" he said. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Build a campfire safely</emphasis><br/><br/> During the summer season, Ontario sees an average of one wildfire each day caused by an unextinguished or unattended campfire. Recreational forest users can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-prevent-forest-fires\">prevent wildfires by practicing good campfire safety</url>, including: picking a site sheltered from the wind and near water; clearing a space around the fire; keeping the flame small and never leaving it unattended; and ensuring the fire is properly put out. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find water if you are outdoors during a wildfire</emphasis><br/><br/> If you find yourself in a wildfire, \"the best thing is evacuate and get the hell out of there, obviously,\" said Arama, \"but if that's not possible, then get to a clearing away from all flammable bush.\"<br/><br/> Forest fires can spread rapidly, so he doesn't recommend trying to outrun a wildfire. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires-safety-information#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20indoors%20during%20a%20wildfire%3A&amp;text=close%20windows%2C%20vents%20and%20blinds,damper%20and%20close%20fireplace%20screens\">Ontario government advises</url> instead that those trapped should find a river, pond or lake to crouch in. If you're not near water, head to a low-lying area and breath air closest to the ground, ideally through a moist cloth to avoid inhaling smoke. Cover yourself with soil, dirt or anything that can shield you from the heat of the fire. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What to do if you are forced to evacuate due to wildfire</emphasis><br/><br/> If you are told to evacuate, listen to the radio or TV and choose a route away from fire hazards, advises the provincial government. If possible, wear long-sleeve clothes and covered shoes to protect yourself from ashes and sparks. And if you have time before you leave, pack enough supplies for a week (see the tips for an emergency kit above), turn off the gas line, turn on your lawn sprinklers and move flammable items away from your dwelling. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keep track of active wildfires</emphasis><br/><br/> You can stay informed and plan your trips properly this summer by keeping track of active wildfires. The Ontario government maintains <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/ForestFireInformationMap/index.html?viewer=FFIM.FFIM&amp;locale=en-CA\">a forest fire info map</url>. Google Maps also has a feature (under \"layers\") that shows users information about the major fires across the country.<br/><br/> Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

Paramedics secured and calmed the 52 year old, who had chest pains and possible broken ribs. OPP called the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) in Trenton for help.</p><p><br/><br/> That's when Capt. Darik Picavet and his four-person crew from RCAF 424 squadron readied their Griffon helicopter. <br/><br/> \"We were on the scene at about 5:30 p.m. The paramedics had him calmed and triaged. Our search and rescue technicians made an assessment and he was hoisted,\" Picavet said. \"(The patient) was very calm and quite comfortable in the stretcher, I assure you.\" <br/><br/> Due to the nature of the injuries, JRCC transported him to The Civic Hospital in Ottawa arriving by 6:30 p.m.<br/><br/> \"It is very satisfying when you get an easy transition to hospital and our job is done,\" Picavet said, adding that airlifts can b be a daily exercise during summer. It was, however, his first time in the Township of Greater Madawaska. <br/><br/> JRCC was called in because Ornge air ambulance does not hover and hoist patients. Ornge must land, but the forested terrain around the lake doesn't allow for it. <br/><br/> The scene unfolded one day before a forest fire forced the evacuation of residents living on Centennial Lake.<br/><br/> CORRECTION<br/><br/> June 5: An inaccurate timeline was presented in the initial version. It was corrected within hours. Inside Ottawa Valley regrets any confusion that may have followed. <br/><br/> Following a request for aid from @OPP_ER members of an #RCAF 424 Sqn Griffon helicopter hoisted an injured dirtbiker from a remote area north of Calabogie, ON on 3 June.  The patient was flown to hospital in Ottawa. #Rescue pic.twitter.com/HIZnP3P2Ni - Trenton JRCC CCCOS (@JRCCTrentCCCOS) June 5, 2023 <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060668112046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-KNP1-F197-50DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Authorities said the evacuation was underway and promised more details Wednesday. </p><p>According to the province's forest fire prevention agency, more than 150 forest fires were burning in the province on Tuesday, including more than 110 deemed out of control.</p><p>Legault said the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region in northwestern Quebec is an area of particular concern, with the communities of Norm\u00e9tal and Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon under threat.</p><p>The mayor of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, where about 2,100 people were forced from their homes on the weekend, said the fire is about 10 kilometres outside of town, but its advance has been slower than expected. \"The fire started in an area where there were no trees, which slowed it down considerably,\" Guy Lafreni\u00e8re said.</p><p>Other northern communities at risk include Chibougamau, where crews have been creating firebreaks, and the Cree village of Chisasibi on the eastern shore of James Bay. Firefighting resources have also been dispatched to Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's Micoua substation near Baie-Comeau, Legault said.</p><p>On Monday, Legault said authorities had no choice but to leave the hamlet of Clova to burn, drawing the ire of local residents. Legault said Tuesday that he had simply repeated what fire prevention officials told him: the fire around the tiny community about 325 kilometres northwest of Montreal was too intense to send water bombers. That remained true Tuesday, he said, but he noted that no homes had burned.</p><p>Dominic Vincent, the owner of the Auberge Restaurant Clova, said that by Monday afternoon, the situation in the area had already improved, aided by cooler temperatures and a change in wind direction. While smoke remained visible, it was far less intense, he said.</p><p>Vincent said that for three days residents worked with crews from Quebec's forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, to protect the village.</p><p>\u201cSOPFEU cut firebreaks and we filled tanks with water, along with our friends from the outfitters next to us, to be able to help the places that didn\u2019t have water and then we tried to stop the fire along the side of the roads,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>With so many fires burning, Legault said authorities were focusing on towns and critical infrastructure. He met with civil security officials and firefighting teams in Sept-\u00celes, Que., where an evacuation order affecting about 4,500 residents of the town and the nearby Innu community of Mani-Utenam was lifted Tuesday.</p><p>Sept-\u00celes Mayor Steeve Beaupr\u00e9 told a separate news conference that the fire was no longer deemed a threat, but he warned residents to be ready to leave again should the situation change.</p><p>\u201cI want to make it clear that the fight is far from over,\" Beaupr\u00e9 said after delivering the good news. \"The fire is still large and active and it could remain so for several days, even several weeks, which means that we could be forced to evacuate certain sectors of Sept-\u00celes again.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bonnardel was in northwestern Quebec where he said more firefighters were expected Wednesday. He said there are concerns for hydro transmission lines and a high-speed internet connection link to the North.</p><p>He defended the government's response to the fires, saying the province is doing everything it can, but all provinces are dealing with their own wildfires.</p><p>\"We're experiencing an unprecedented situation, exceptional, everywhere on Quebec territory,\" Bonnardel said. \"We've never had so many fires so early in the season, it's not just a problem for Quebec, it's a problem all over Canada.\"</p><p>Another 250 firefighters are expected in the region in the coming days to join the 230 already on the ground, Bonnardel said.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina told reporters in Quebec City that evacuees across the province number just over 8,300, down from 10,000 to start the week, but the Abitibi region remains a concern. \"We are not expecting rain in the short term, which is what makes it more difficult to fight fires,\" Blanchette V\u00e9zina said.</p><p>Forest access bans remain in effect for several regions, and open fires are banned throughout Quebec.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7505a965d40d45cf9595f14297250769</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-HBV1-DY9S-T0C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><timeReceived>10:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 6, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Smoke drift is travelling as far as north of Timmins, down through Sudbury and past Parry Sound.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> See smoke and are unsure if you should call it in? Generally if you see a column of smoke, give Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services a call at 310-FIRE if you're located north of the French and Mattawa Rivers (or 911 if you're south of these rivers); otherwise, check their interactive fire map or the above smoke-related websites to determine if what you're seeing is drifting heavy smoke.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. For more details, please consult <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html\">www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html</url>.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA\">https://www.wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA</url>.<br/><br/> Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airhealth.ca\">www.airhealth.ca</url> for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.<br/><br/> To report severe weather, send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ONstorm@canada.ca\">ONstorm@canada.ca</email> or tweet reports using #ONStorm. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023060668112183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-KNP1-F197-50JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.
