I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver&amp; -a moderate climate&amp; -and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \"work\" as a clerk in my dad's general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don't have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p><p>David Zirnhelt is a rancher, member of the Cariboo Cattlemen's Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake.</p><p>Read More: Ranch Musings: Drought and the perilous bounty</p><p>Do you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?

They are no longer seeing bees visiting the flowers in their gardens as often as they were before, and have become concerned that the smoke may be killing or incapacitating Nature's industrious little workers.</p><p>As daytime temperatures in the valley have not cooled enough over the past few months to blame cooler air on the lack of bees it is obvious that something else is at play.</p><p>A study undertaken by Oregon State University on the effect of wildfire on bee colonies done in 2020 makes note of a Swedish research project that studied qualities of light around forest fire haze. The study showed that bees and many other insects use patterns of polarized light in the sky as something similar to a compass to help them navigate from their nest to flowers, and then back to the nest. These patterns are still readable to the bees when it is cloudy, but when smoke comes into the mix the amount of polarized light can fall to levels that bees and tiny insects can no longer discern.</p><p>This can result in the bees going in different directions than usual, which can make finding a flower for its nectar a confusing task. The study noted this is something that may be why bees seem to stay closer to their hive or nest when there is excess smoke in the air. They also noted that with wildfire smoke in the air the bees were seen to be making shorter flights, thus remaining closer to their nests for easier returns.</p><p>Wild bees that make their nests in wood and twigs are unfortunately killed by forest fires. However, bees who make their nests in the ground (called 'mining bees') will survive the fire. The study also pointed out that very few wild bees make their homes in closed canopy forests, and as a result bee numbers usually increase in the years following a wildfire. This is often due to the fact that large areas of land that have lost tight knit forests have now become open areas that sprout fireweed, wild shrubs, and other nectar producing banquets for the bees, and as a result help to restore post-fire areas to healthy ecosystems.</p><p>We checked in with local apiarist Jayne D'Entremont, on how her bees are handling the air quality right now?</p><p>\"My hives are actually doing better than I thought they would be,\" said D'Entremont, who runs the Canny Crofter Farm in Barriere where she produces and markets honey from her hives.</p><p>\"My biggest problem is there is a bit of a dearth of nectar sources due to the heat. Although, I was up the back of the property and there's quite a few wild flowers as well as snow-berry bushes that are just starting to bloom.\"</p><p>Wildfire smoke does impact bees, but is seems that as long as a constant source of nectar is available, both domesticated honey bees and wild bees can survive the effects.</p><p>___________________</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@starjournal.net\">news@starjournal.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook</p><p>Copyright 2021 Barriere Star Journal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-news20210805PBA4194930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639G-0NY1-JD2C-J2XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

They are no longer seeing bees visiting the flowers in their gardens as often as they were before, and have become concerned that the smoke may be killing or incapacitating Nature's industrious little workers.</p><p>As daytime temperatures in the valley have not cooled enough over the past few months to blame cooler air on the lack of bees it is obvious that something else is at play.</p><p>A study undertaken by Oregon State University on the effect of wildfire on bee colonies done in 2020 makes note of a Swedish research project that studied qualities of light around forest fire haze. The study showed that bees and many other insects use patterns of polarized light in the sky as something similar to a compass to help them navigate from their nest to flowers, and then back to the nest. These patterns are still readable to the bees when it is cloudy, but when smoke comes into the mix the amount of polarized light can fall to levels that bees and tiny insects can no longer discern.</p><p>This can result in the bees going in different directions than usual, which can make finding a flower for its nectar a confusing task. The study noted this is something that may be why bees seem to stay closer to their hive or nest when there is excess smoke in the air. They also noted that with wildfire smoke in the air the bees were seen to be making shorter flights, thus remaining closer to their nests for easier returns.</p><p>Wild bees that make their nests in wood and twigs are unfortunately killed by forest fires. However, bees who make their nests in the ground (called 'mining bees') will survive the fire. The study also pointed out that very few wild bees make their homes in closed canopy forests, and as a result bee numbers usually increase in the years following a wildfire. This is often due to the fact that large areas of land that have lost tight knit forests have now become open areas that sprout fireweed, wild shrubs, and other nectar producing banquets for the bees, and as a result help to restore post-fire areas to healthy ecosystems.</p><p>We checked in with local apiarist Jayne D'Entremont, on how her bees are handling the air quality right now?</p><p>\"My hives are actually doing better than I thought they would be,\" said D'Entremont, who runs the Canny Crofter Farm in Barriere where she produces and markets honey from her hives.</p><p>\"My biggest problem is there is a bit of a dearth of nectar sources due to the heat. Although, I was up the back of the property and there's quite a few wild flowers as well as snow-berry bushes that are just starting to bloom.\"</p><p>Wildfire smoke does impact bees, but is seems that as long as a constant source of nectar is available, both domesticated honey bees and wild bees can survive the effects.</p><p>___________________</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@starjournal.net\">news@starjournal.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-4194930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-W5S1-F103-33YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Barriere Star Journal (N.

Sparks from railways or motor vehicles, carelessly discarded cigarettes, workplace mishaps, and open burning that went awry are all causes of fires, but much of the focus on prevention is on campfires, often those in the back country started by campers.</p><p>That focus on preventing campfires from sparking wildfires, and educating those using the back country, is by no means new. In the April 5, 1913 issue of the Journal \u2014 well in advance of that year\u2019s fire season \u2014 an article appeared under the headline \u201cGovernment Instructions For Careless Campers\u201d. Apart from some slightly archaic phrasing and language, the piece could have been written today, since tips on how to prevent wildfires haven\u2019t changed much in the past 108 years.</p><p>The piece also shows the ongoing issue with human-caused wildfires in the province. The writer of that long-ago article would probably be disheartened to find that, more than a century later, such advice is still sadly necessary. Here it is in full.</p><p>\u201cHow many of the 188 fires of which the causes are still unknown were the result of an untended camp fire is open to surmise, but as in most of the other risks such as railway and road construction, and logging operations the existence of fire is at once known, the camper may be justly held to account for a very large proportion of the season\u2019s conflagrations.</p><p>\u201cThe Forest Branch is endeavouring to co-operate in every way with those who have work to perform which is attended with danger to the forest. But the greatest danger of all \u2014 that of the man who is careless with his camp fire, still remains open, and it can be removed only be increased watchfulness on the part of every individual who uses the woods for pleasure or profit.</p><p>\u201c1. Be sure your match is out before you throw it away.</p><p>\u201c2. Knock out your pipe ashes or throw your cigar or cigarette stump where there is nothing to catch fire.</p><p>\u201c3. Don\u2019t build a campfire any larger than is absolutely necessary. Never leave it, even for a short time, without putting it out with water or earth.</p><p>\u201c4. Don\u2019t build a campfire against a tree or log. Build a small one where you can scrape away the needles, leaves or grass from all sides of it.</p><p>\u201c5. Don\u2019t build bonfires. The wind may come up at any time and start a fire which you cannot control.</p><p>\u201c6. If you discover a fire, put it out if possible; if you can\u2019t, get word of it to the nearest forest ranger or fire warden as quickly as you possibly can.\u201d</p><p>These days it is considerably easier (and faster) to report a forest fire than it was in 1913:simply call 1-800-6635555 (or *5555 from a cell phone).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20210701PPIA0001978794</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6321-1BV1-JD2C-J3YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver\u2014a moderate climate\u2014and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \"work\" as a clerk in my dad's general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don't have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods.

Sparks from railways or motor vehicles, carelessly discarded cigarettes, workplace mishaps, and open burning that went awry are all causes of fires, but much of the focus on prevention is on campfires, often those in the back country started by campers.</p><p>That focus on preventing campfires from sparking wildfires, and educating those using the back country, is by no means new. In the April 5, 1913 issue of the Journal \u2014 well in advance of that year's fire season \u2014 an article appeared under the headline \"Government Instructions For Careless Campers\". Apart from some slightly archaic phrasing and language, the piece could have been written today, since tips on how to prevent wildfires haven't changed much in the past 108 years.</p><p>The piece also shows the ongoing issue with human-caused wildfires in the province. The writer of that long-ago article would probably be disheartened to find that, more than a century later, such advice is still sadly necessary. Here it is in full.</p><p>\"How many of the 188 fires of which the causes are still unknown were the result of an untended camp fire is open to surmise, but as in most of the other risks such as railway and road construction, and logging operations the existence of fire is at once known, the camper may be justly held to account for a very large proportion of the season's conflagrations.</p><p>\"The Forest Branch is endeavouring to co-operate in every way with those who have work to perform which is attended with danger to the forest. But the greatest danger of all \u2014 that of the man who is careless with his camp fire, still remains open, and it can be removed only be increased watchfulness on the part of every individual who uses the woods for pleasure or profit.</p><p>\"1. Be sure your match is out before you throw it away.</p><p>\"2. Knock out your pipe ashes or throw your cigar or cigarette stump where there is nothing to catch fire.</p><p>\"3. Don't build a campfire any larger than is absolutely necessary. Never leave it, even for a short time, without putting it out with water or earth.</p><p>\"4. Don't build a campfire against a tree or log. Build a small one where you can scrape away the needles, leaves or grass from all sides of it.</p><p>\"5. Don't build bonfires. The wind may come up at any time and start a fire which you cannot control.</p><p>\"6. If you discover a fire, put it out if possible; if you can't, get word of it to the nearest forest ranger or fire warden as quickly as you possibly can.\"</p><p>These days it is considerably easier (and faster) to report a forest fire than it was in 1913: simply call 1-800-663-5555 (or *5555 from a cell phone).</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@accjournal.ca\">editorial@accjournal.ca</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Ashcroft Cache Creek Journal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20210630PAS4178952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:631T-1GY1-JD2C-J566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver&amp; -a moderate climate&amp; -and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \"work\" as a clerk in my dad's general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don't have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods.

The annex consists of seventeen bedrooms, with bath room, parlour, and writing room. The dining room of the hotel will be lengthened about twenty feet and a new kitchen built on the side. Everything will be in first class shape for the accommodation of visitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Slate Creek Tragedy: Coroner Clapperton, Dr. Sutton, and Revd. E.E. Hardwick returned last Friday evening to Nicola Lake from the scene of the tragedy at Slate Creek and from them the following particulars have been gathered respecting the shooting and death of James Hamilton.</p><p>It seems that W. Kyle, Ole Benson, and the deceased, James Hamilton, were engaged in mining on adjacent claims in the vicinity of and about a quarter of a mile from the residence of Mr. Rabbitt, a rancher in the Slate creek district close by the Tulameen river. Mr. Rabbitt had gone away a few miles distant to attend to some mail matter and left Mrs. Rabbitt, with her three small children, the youngest still nursing, at home. Messrs. Kyle and Benson testified at the inquest that they heard Mrs. Rabbitt screaming and they went to ascertain the cause when they met the man Hamilton, who was subsequently shot, coming from the direction of Rabbitt's house. On being questioned about his actions, he admitted trying to have some fun with the woman, but nothing serious, and afterwards remarked that he would go back and make it all up. Further evidence went to show that he attempted a criminal assault on the woman, but she succeeded in escaping unharmed from her assailant.</p><p>Hamilton then returned to his work, but the woman, terribly excited, went straight to the house, took down a 45-60 Winchester rifle, and gave it to Mr. Kyle. In a short time Hamilton returned, when Mrs. Rabbitt took the rifle from Kyle, who shouted to Hamilton to keep back, but he not heeding the advice, the woman fired at 15 or 20 yards distance, and the unfortunate man, staggering and severely wounded, sat down upon a stone. Kyle and the others gathered round him and took him into a cabin near by where he suffered terrible agony for 18 hours and expired before the doctor arrived. He refused to make any statement respecting the cause of the tragedy, but said that his comrades could tell all about it.</p><p>The deceased had been acquainted with Mrs. Rabbitt for about six years. Immediately after the occurrence of the tragedy Constable Hunter took Mrs. Rabbitt into custody. General sympathy is felt throughout the entire district for the prisoner, who is about 25 years of age, and her small family, on account of the sad trouble into which they have been so suddenly plunged by this serious and most unfortunate affair.</p><p>The Slate Creek Tragedy; Coroner's Inquiry: An announcement last week of the shooting of Jas. Hamilton of Slate creek by Mrs. Thos. Rabbitt, the following is the result of the coroner's inquest which was held at Tulameen, on Tuesday, 21st inst., by Coroner John Clapperton. He briefly addressed the jury and allowed them to retire to consider their verdict: \"We, the jury empanelled to enquire into the matter of the death of James Hamilton after hearing the evidence given in the case, do find that James Hamilton came to his death by a gun shot wound, said gun being in the hands of Mrs. Euphemia Rabbitt. And it is our belief that Mrs. Euphemia Rabbitt shot the said James Hamilton in self-defence.\" Mrs. Rabbitt was committed to stand her trial at Kamloops Assizes. Much sympathy is expressed all through the district for Mrs. Rabbitt and for her family.</p><p>100 YEARS AGO: SEPT. 30, 1922</p><p>Ashcroft Annual Race Meet: Arrangements are being made for, and posters are being printed announcing the Ashcroft annual race meet. A new race track is being prepared on the flat above the town [now the Mesa subdivision] \u2026 The new track is a half-mile oval one and is overlooking the town. When completed it will be one of the best tracks in B.C. Prizes as high as $75 will be given. A special prize of a $25 wrist watch will be given in the \u00bd mile ladies race.</p><p>Night Policeman: Owing to the numerous thefts which have taken place in Ashcroft through breaking into business houses, something should be done in the town to secure the services of a night policeman. The fact that there are no lights during the night is a great aid to robbers. The government should be approached with a view to supplying the town with a night policeman.</p><p>For Sale: One medium large Cary Safe, as good as new. Can be seen at Journal office. Price $85. The cost of this safe was about $150. [There were obviously no takers, as the safe in question can still be seen at the Journal office.]</p><p>B.C. Had 2,429 Forest Fires This Season: Forest fire danger for the year is about over, according to reports today to the chief forester. Last week, however, 145 new fires were discovered and reported by rangers. This brings fires in B.C. up to 2,429. Conditions are reported safe all over the province. [There were 1,559 wildfires reported in B.C. during the 2022 fire season.]</p><p>75 YEARS AGO: OCT. 2, 1947</p><p>Old Mill Honey Best In B.C.: At the Armstrong District Exhibition 1947, the Old Mill Apiaries, Ashcroft, learned from high authorities that they had the best honey in British Columbia, and that none of the other provinces have anything to equal it. At the Armstrong exhibit the Old Mill Apiaries honey took first in District Exhibit; first in B.C. Honey Producers Exhibit and Senior Championship Medal, equivalent to Gold Medal. Mr. Wm. C. Feedham, owner, and Mr. Syd Jackson are to be complimented in their efforts to put Ashcroft on the map. The demand for their honey has always far exceeded supply.</p><p>Trustees Vote To Hold Pay At $300 Per Year: At the convention at Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia school trustees voted in favour of a salary of not more than $300 a year for school trustees. Hookey playing also came in for attention when W.R. Bone of the federal health and welfare department said that the family allowance can be withheld from mothers who keep their children from school or who refuse to help in preventing their children from playing hookey.</p><p>Immunization Week October 5-11: The battle of public health authorities and health educationists to wipe out those twin menaces, diphtheria and whooping cough, appears to be gaining ground. Provisional figures supplied by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics show that in 1946 there were fewer cases of, and deaths from, both diseases than in 1945. We have the means to wipe out these diseases. All we lack is the 100 per cent cooperation of the public. Parents and guardians throughout the nation must be made to realize that diphtheria and whooping cough are preventable \u2014 and that their public health officers and their family physicians have the means to protect them and their children against the menace of these twin scourges.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO: SEPT. 28, 1972</p><p>Bomb Threat Serious Act: The Ashcroft Secondary School was evacuated during the afternoon of Wednesday, Sept. 27, following a phone call received at the school stating there was a bomb in the building. A search of the school by the RCMP and school employees failed to locate any suspicious objects. The RCMP are continuing their investigation of the bomb threat, which caused a disruption of classes and forced the children to stand outside in the cold while the building was searched.</p><p>Lytton News: Lytton's only asset dropped to nil on the weekend when the temperature dropped to 33 [F.] and snow appeared low on the mountains with a raw wind blowing. Really a dirty trick weatherwise for the \"hottest place in Canada\".</p><p>Clinton News: Monday morning the Clinton temperature registered about 14 degrees [F.]. Sure was cold! But the real jolt came Monday evening with a real nasty blizzard which made driving a real hazard. Let's hope that now we may have Indian Summer!</p><p>Highland Valley News: For anyone needing a supply of Vitamin C for the winter months ahead, there is still a good supply of rose hips to be had along Highland Valley road. While their peak is past, in many places the hips are still firm enough to be candied or cleaned and dried, while the softer ones make good puree or jam.</p><p>Do you want to read more from the Journal archives?

The Horton\u2019s company covered the cost of the course-close to $8,000-as well as classroom time and accommodation for the instructor, Roy Bernhardt from Lifesavers First Aid Training Ltd.in Prince George. The District of 100 Mile House offered the use of its Emergency Training Centre on Exeter Road for the practical component of the course.</p><p>While the material is condensed over the two-day program, Bernhardt said it\u2019s a good overview of the basics, including the different types of fuels, fire behaviours, hose rolling and learning to operate and respect the pumps, as well as hose-laying techniques and tandem and relay pumping.</p><p>\u201cWith my experience, you learn the basics here,\u201d said Bernhardt, who\u2019s been teaching these types of course for 22 years.</p><p>\u201cYou get to play with this different equipment and become familiar with it, then you get out to a fire and you\u2019ll learn out there.\u201d</p><p>Mikayla Glen, who has been working at the fire camp in town doing food prep, has never taken any firefighting training but decided to sign up when she saw the course advertised.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed pretty interesting, and it\u2019s a good way to help out my community,\u201d Glen said.</p><p>Brandon Plewes took the course as a refresher-he has worked in various capacities of firefighting in the past-and said he signed up a few of the guys on his crew so they could pitch in with the firefighting efforts as well.</p><p>His company, Cariboo Cord King, works in wildfire fuel management during the winter months and Plewes said the extra training for both him and his crew would be beneficial during fire-related work stoppages.</p><p>\u201cWe do the same thing in the winter, except we don\u2019t have the threat of forest fire,\u201d said Plewes, who is on the hunt for a few new employees. \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping the community safe, and making sure that we can stay working when everything else is shut down.\u201d</p><p>With a long list of interested locals who didn\u2019t make it into this course, Anny said she\u2019s hopeful that other businesses in the community might step up to help sponsor another offering this summer.</p><p>\u201cWe could make this work again in a week or two if we had another sponsor, or if other employers wanted to donate,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth the money, it\u2019s an immediate effect on our community. They\u2019ll be out there working on these fires right away.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20210729UAEA0002036697</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6380-6DF1-F0HF-82GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Here\u2019s the key point and everyone needs to understand this, a lightning strike ignition is a natural and inevitable occurrence, it\u2019s nature\u2019s way of maintaining healthy forests.</p><p>The fact that houses are ignited when a wildfire approaches a townsite has much less to do with the wildfire and much more to do with the high flammability conditions that homeowners have established on their properties.</p><p>Mortimer recommends that residents, especially those living on or near the forested edge of town, get serious about removing cedar hedges and juniper bushes, lower branches of conifer (evergreen) trees, and long grass from their yards.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t do this now \u2013 it will be too late when a forest fire is approaching the backyard fence.\u201d</p><p>Draw an imaginary circle 10 metres (30 feet) away from and surrounding their house and look at the vegetation and other combustible items inside that circle.</p><p>\u201cAsk yourself, if you threw a handful of burning embers on those items under the hot and dry conditions we have in place now, would those trees, bushes, grass, firewood or piled building materials light up and spread fire to your home?\u201d If the answer is yes, remove those items. If it\u2019s vegetation, bring it down to the arena parking lot dumpsters and if it\u2019s firewood or building materials, move them 10 metres away from your house or store them in a FireSmart shed or outbuilding constructed to FireSmart guidelines.</p><p>To be FireSmart, a shed or outbuilding features closed-up construction with no way for embers to get into or under the structure and no plants or combustible materials within 1.5 metres or 5 feet.</p><p>The structure can even be made of wood, and can be placed right beside your house regardless of what\u2019s in it. It\u2019s \u201cFireSmart mitigated\u201d if it meets the ember proofing and combustible surface clearance requirements.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve been talking about FireSmart mitigations that you can perform in your yard, but the same approach applies to your house and there is lots of information available on how to reduce the wildfire hazard on your home and outbuildings as well as your yard,\u201d added Mortimer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that simple, no excuses, so let\u2019s get FireSmart!

Both Suzuki and Cullis are first-time stage performers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the show they talk about their working relationship and 50-year marriage, and explore the connections between love for each other and love for the planet. \"If we see Mother Earth as part of our family,\" said Suzuki, \"then this is how we're really going to work to protect nature.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The story behind this production began five years ago when Why Not Theatre's co-artistic director Ravi Jain invited Suzuki to play the title role in \"The Life of Galileo\" by Bertolt Brecht. \"Galileo was the scientist who the world didn't want to believe at the time,\" explained Jain. \"I thought, what a great way to talk about the planet without talking about the planet.\"</p><p>Suzuki was honoured by the invitation and told Jain that if he were 30 years younger he would have jumped at the opportunity. \"But I just couldn't take the thought of memorizing all those lines,\" Suzuki recalled. Nonetheless, a relationship was sparked and along with Why Not colleagues Miriam Fernandes and Kevin Matthew Wong, Jain began a series of interviews with Suzuki in the interest of developing a stage play with him.</p><p>\"In all my notes he kept mentioning 'Tara, Tara, Tara,'\" recalled Jain, who then wondered, \"what if she's in this with him?\" They developed a show in which Suzuki and Cullis, playing themselves, engage in an extended conversation with Jain and Fernandes, as if the four were at a dinner party.</p><p>They premiered the production at Vancouver's PuSH Festival in March 2020 and were looking forward to touring the show nationally. During the pandemic, Why Not made a film version of the show, with Fernandes's husband Sturla Alvsvaag replacing Jain, who was on paternity leave. \"It is actually a much better conceit, now that it's two couples,\" said Jain. It is this version that is being performed at Luminato.</p><p>\"I'm thrilled with what we've developed,\" said Suzuki, \"because quite frankly, the star is Tara. And I think the story of Tara's life has always been the role that many women or partners of prominent people play.\"</p><p>While Suzuki's is the household name, it was Cullis who had the idea to create the David Suzuki Foundation in 1990. \"I had to, because you must remember him being called Dr. Doom and Gloom,\" said Cullis. \"I felt that 'OK, people are listening ... they get that there's a problem.'</p><p>Having heard Suzuki ring the alarm bells about the climate crisis across many media, people \"wanted to know what they can do about it,\" she added.</p><p>As does Suzuki, Cullis has a PhD, and spent five years as a professor at Harvard University - commuting during term-time between Toronto and Boston - before leaving academia to focus on the Foundation's environmental work. Cullis's \"intellectual contribution has been enormous,\" said Suzuki, \"and shaped a great deal of my message.\" At the PuSH Festival, many more people were lined up to talk to Cullis after the show than to him, Suzuki recalled.</p><p>Asked if she enjoyed the recognition, Cullis allowed with a laugh that \"after 50 years, it feels pretty good.\" The experience of making the film version of \"What You Won't Do For Love\" and participating in media interviews has been a learning curve, though. \"I'm not familiar with that kind of thing. David's an old hand,\" she said. \"There's so much standing and waiting ... I'm getting more of a glimpse of that.\"</p><p>\"She thinks I just drift off to exotic places and have a wonderful time,\" chuckled Suzuki.</p><p>For Jain, the experience of getting to know Suzuki and Cullis has been life-changing. \"They are extremely generous and loving people. They really care, and that's in everything they do ... theatre takes a ton of time, and they are the two busiest people I've ever met,\" said Jain.</p><p>\"When you see them interact with people, they are just pure love. And so that fight for the planet, it's all coming from love.\"</p><p>For Cullis, the bottom line is the message they're sending about climate crisis: \"This is theatre, it's the arts. It's not a scientific paper or a lecture on ecology,\" she said. \"Telling people facts and figures and saying, 'Now change your behaviour,' doesn't seem to work. So we're trying something new, and maybe this will work better.\"</p><p>\"What You Won't Do For Love\" plays at the Canadian Opera Company Theatre, 227 Front Street E., from June 9-19. There is a Q&amp;A with the performers after every show except the show on June 17.

These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this COVID-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at airports in Saskatchewan. </p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide over $3.3 million to the following Saskatchewan airports for safety-related projects:</p><p>La Ronge</p><p> Purchase of a wet/dry material spreader - $110,700</p><p>Prince Albert</p><p> Purchase of a wet/dry material spreader - $110,700</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects, \u00a0\u00a0including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing. </p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over\u00a0$1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"We know how vital airports are to urban centres and remote communities. The investment our government is making will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airports not only for personal travel and business, but also for community resupply of essential goods and access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. This is part of how we build stronger more resilient and inclusive communities across Canada.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies</p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada. This is more important than ever as we work towards reopening our economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> Purchase of a wet/dry material spreader - $110,700</p><p>Associated Links</p><p> Purchase of a wet/dry material spreader - $110,700</p><p>Transport Canada is online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tc.gc.ca\">www.tc.gc.ca</url>.

Here's the key point and everyone needs to understand this, a lightning strike ignition is a natural and inevitable occurrence, it's nature's way of maintaining healthy forests.</p><p>The fact that houses are ignited when a wildfire approaches a townsite has much less to do with the wildfire and much more to do with the high flammability conditions that homeowners have established on their properties.</p><p>Mortimer recommends that residents, especially those living on or near the forested edge of town, get serious about removing cedar hedges and juniper bushes, lower branches of conifer (evergreen) trees, and long grass from their yards.</p><p>\"If you don't do this now \u2013 it will be too late when a forest fire is approaching the backyard fence.\"</p><p>Draw an imaginary circle 10 metres (30 feet) away from and surrounding their house and look at the vegetation and other combustible items inside that circle.</p><p>\"Ask yourself, if you threw a handful of burning embers on those items under the hot and dry conditions we have in place now, would those trees, bushes, grass, firewood or piled building materials light up and spread fire to your home?\"</p><p>If the answer is yes, remove those items. If it's vegetation, bring it down to the arena parking lot dumpsters and if it's firewood or building materials, move them 10 metres away from your house or store them in a FireSmart shed or outbuilding constructed to FireSmart guidelines.</p><p>To be FireSmart, a shed or outbuilding features closed-up construction with no way for embers to get into or under the structure and no plants or combustible materials within 1.5 metres or 5 feet.</p><p>The structure can even be made of wood, and can be placed right beside your house regardless of what's in it. It's \"FireSmart mitigated\" if it meets the ember proofing and combustible surface clearance requirements.</p><p>\"So we've been talking about FireSmart mitigations that you can perform in your yard, but the same approach applies to your house and there is lots of information available on how to reduce the wildfire hazard on your home and outbuildings as well as your yard,\" added Mortimer.</p><p>\"It's that simple, no excuses, so let's get FireSmart! You'll sleep easier especially when you're out of town on summer vacation.\"</p><p>For more info see: City of Rossland FireSmart website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rossland.ca/firesmart-program\">www.rossland.ca/firesmart-program</url>, FireSmart BC: firesmartbc.ca/, and FireSmart Canada: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.firesmartcanada.ca/\">www.firesmartcanada.ca/</url>.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Rossland News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ROSNWS-news20210727PTL4190842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ROSNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637J-73K1-F0HF-8004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438271</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It comprises 6,378 hectares and has a multitude of public trails of varying degrees of difficulty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forest is located within Tree Farm Licence (TFL) 44 and is separated into two distinct areas: Sproat Operating Area and Taylor Operating Area.</p><p>The Sproat Operating Area is located approximately 11 km northwest of Port Alberni, north of Highway 4, opposite Sproat Lake Landing. It slopes southward from the height of land between the Great Central Lake watershed, and Highway 4 and is bounded to the east by private land owned by Island Timberlands, and to the west by Friesen Creek. The area encompasses 3000 hectares.</p><p>The Taylor Operating Area slopes northward from the height of land between Mount Klitsa and Adder Mountain, and Highway 4 at Sutton Creek and the Taylor River. It is bounded to the east by Klitsa Creek and to the west by a southeast to northwest line running along the height of land from Adder Mountain to Sutton Pass east of the boundary of Clayoquot Sound. The area encompasses 3378 hectares.</p><p>The AVCF has an annual allowable cut of 19,000 cubic metres, but Law says they stick to 10,000 cubic metres or less \"which is what we feel is a sustainable rate of harvest.\"</p><p>The idea behind the community forest was to put control of land and resources in local hands while creating a viable timber and non-timber forest resource business. The City of Port Alberni is the sole owner of the forest.</p><p>Law, his crews and contractors have a symbiotic relationship with the public when it comes to getting work accomplished within the working forest. Whether it's stacking wood for people to cut under permit or ensuring the vast trail system is safe for users, Law always has the public in mind.</p><p>The firewood cutting program was more popular than ever in 2020 as more people stuck close to home, Law said. The AVCF works with the Ministry of Forests, Lands and National Resource Operations, which issues firewood cutting permits.</p><p>In 2020 crews moved waste wood to the side of the logging roads within the forest for safe public access. Providing this waste wood reduces the need to burn slash piles so it reduces forest fire risk, Law said. This also helped cut down on fire hazard.</p><p>It is important to only cut in the areas indicated on maps provided on the AVCF web page, found at communityforest.ca/firewood.</p><p>Permits may be filled out online on the South Island Forest District web page (search \"personal use firewood cutting on Crown land\") or in person at the Port Alberni office, 4885 Cherry Creek Rd.</p><p>The Weiner Creek and Bookout Creek areas are most popular with outdoor recreation enthusiasts, whether it be walkers, hikers or in winter, skiers and snowshoers. Regular brush cutting is done on trails, and last winter some trails around Weiner Creek were rerouted to accommodate blasting and provide better scenic views.</p><p>While logging regularly occurs in the forest\u2014it is a working forest, after all\u2014sustainability is always top of mind. In 2020 more than 48,000 trees were planted.</p><p>Although there were no timber sales in 2020, the AVCF was still in a position to write a $300,000 dividend cheque to the City of Port Alberni.</p><p>To learn more about the Alberni Valley Community Forest and to view the 2020 AGM presentation, visit the website at communityforest.ca.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Alberni Valley News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20210924PAE4217931</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63P4-H1V1-JD2C-J2WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Inspired by recent world issues - including health and environmental challenges - nine Canadian kids have become finalists in a global design competition, each of them designing a unique vehicle to help make the world a better place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every year, Toyota invites kids across Canada (and around the world) to design a 'dream car' to help make the world a better place. Here are the three Canadian winners (and finalists in the worldwide competition) in each age category (along with their designs):</p><p>Under 8 Years Old //st * Nya Ketchabaw (age 7, Sioux Lookout, ON). Nya's entry - \"Forest Fire Fighter Pangolin Car\" - uses zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell technology to fly over forest fires and extinguish them by spraying water from its tail. The vehicle's tongue acts as a ladder to pick up animals and humans and bring them to safety. * Bernadette Isabella Irwandi (age 5, Collingwood, ON). Bernadette's entry - \"Stray Animal Ambulance\" - acts an ambulance for sick and injured stray animals and has a special \"booster\" to bring them to nearby animal hospitals more quickly. * Candice Bie (age 4, Hamilton, ON). Candice's entry - \"Crabby Car\" - drives on land and dives under water to collect the garbage polluting our lakes and oceans. The specially designed \"crab eyes\" at the front assist the driver while driving through dark areas.</p><p>8 to 11 Years Old //st * Ryan Lychak (age 10, Sherwood Park, AB). Ryan's entry - \"Fusion Craft\" - creates a new energy source by turning garbage to power. As the vehicle flies, it collects garbage and dirty air, converting it to clean power and releasing clean air. * Bellina Man (age 9, Vaughan, ON). Bellina's entry - \"Ocean Life Rescuer\"- cleans up plastic waste in the ocean and sends a team to rescue animals impacted by plastic pollution, \"making our ocean a happy home for all\". * Aryan Shakya (age 11, North York, ON). Aryan's entry - Eco-friendly Realistic Safe Smart Car - is equipped with advanced technology, artificial intelligence and is powered using sustainable energy including water, solar and electric sources.</p><p>12 to 15 Years Old //st * Joseph Lee (age 14, Airdrie, AB). Joseph's entry - Surgery on the Road - is a vehicle designed to help doctors provide surgery while a patient is in transit to increase their chance of survival. * Yiling Wang (age 15, Burnaby, BC). Yiling's entry - The Toypillda - envisions a special pill for patients to consume, which allows doctors to journey inside the patient's body to treat an injury, confront bacteria and heal wounds. * Johnny Wang (age 15, Vancouver, BC). Johnny's entry - Forest Guardian - helps protect animals in the forest by spraying water in fire regions and rescuing animals using its tail.</p><p>A panel of distinguished Canadian judges was tasked with assessing hundreds of entries from kids across Canada: //st * Dr. Bonnie Schmidt - President, Let's Talk Science * Lorraine Sommerfeld - Automotive Journalist, Driving.ca * Brian Sheppard - Creative Director at Saatchi Canada * Heather Greenwood-Davis - Creative Influencer, Journalist and Media Host * Larry Hutchinson, President and CEO, Toyota Canada</p><p>Here's what the judges had to say about the submissions to this year's contest:</p><p>\"I'm truly impressed by the creative, innovative and world-changing ideas presented by Canadian youth. With their vision to design a future that is more sustainable for our people, animals and ecosystem, it's clear to see that these are the leaders of tomorrow bringing forward their world-changing ideas.\" - Larry Hutchinson, President and CEO, Toyota Canada Inc.</p><p>\"Transformative innovations start with an idea. Congratulations to all youth who participated in this competition. Imagination, ingenuity, hope and creativity shines through in the submissions, making judging especially difficult. Participants designed wonderful vehicles that help people, animals and the environment, showing what good hands our future is in.\" - Bonnie Schmidt, President, Let's Talk Science</p><p>\"This year's entrants are proof our kids are very much engaged with and concerned for the future of the planet. They see cars as vehicles that can lead to better, safer times. The level of thought and consideration in all age groups is really remarkable.\"- Lorraine Sommerfeld, Canadian Automotive Journalist, Driving.ca</p><p>\"Overall, there were some super smart concepts and some amazing pieces of artwork. What this contest demonstrates is that young Canadians are both thoughtful about the world and the role technology and vehicles play in it... and are also very creative.\" - Brian Sheppard, Executive Creative Director, Saatchi &amp;Saatchi</p><p>\"The submissions were all incredible.

Consider: forest fires this year have killed more people in Canada than enemy aircraft ever have.</p><p>Before we lose $77 billion of taxpayers' money down the drain called \"defence spending,\" we might ask ourselves why we have jet fighters in the first place. Fighters do not, in any real sense, defend Canada's airspace. Rather, we're protected by American nuclear weapons.</p><p>The only serious threat to Canada and the United States is a nuclear strike by the only country on Earth with enough missiles to overwhelm us. Thus, we co-operate to defend our airspace with early warning radars, which would detect the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and give us enough time to retaliate. The Northern Hemisphere would be reduced to ash within a few hours, plunging the planet into an expedited climatological catastrophe that would end life as we know it.</p><p>Mutually assured destruction, grim as it is, is what protects us - and fighter jets, no matter how sophisticated, do not. It's a common misconception, but fighters cannot intercept an ICBM. Moreover, any attack by enemy strategic bombers would produce the same result.</p><p>This is why most of Canada's fighters were in Western Europe during the Cold War, and why they were equipped with nuclear bombs rather than air-to-air missiles. From the moment ICBMs replaced strategic bombers as the primary nuclear weapon delivery system until the end of the Cold War, Canada had but a few dozen fighter aircraft available for air defence. Occasionally, they would intercept a Soviet bomber on a training flight to Cuba.</p><p>The acquisition of our F-18s in the late 1970s made a lot of sense, given they were based in West Germany to defend NATO against an attack by the Warsaw Pact. We couldn't have picked a better fighter, but the end of the Cold War meant Canada had a number of sophisticated combat aircraft and no use for them. Successive governments sought every opportunity to employ the aircraft in combat roles, essentially to justify their cost to taxpayers.</p><p>It's a point worth considering: Canada has only ever used its F-18s to bomb countries that posed absolutely no threat to us. Moreover, our F-18s have never bombed a country into democracy, stability or prosperity. Wherever they have gone, only misery has followed.</p><p>Now we're expected to replace them because some of our politicians wish for Canada to remain in NATO, a defence alliance designed to counter the threat posed by a country that no longer exists.</p><p>Any nation so foolish it would actually consider spending $77 billion on combat aircraft to fight a war we won 30 years ago probably needs to be reminded you can't shoot down a forest fire or bomb the pandemic.</p><p>Taylor C.

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver&amp; -a moderate climate&amp; -and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \"work\" as a clerk in my dad's general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don't have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p><p>David Zirnhelt is a rancher, member of the Cariboo Cattlemen's Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake.</p><p>Read More: Ranch Musings: Drought and the perilous bounty</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@wltribune.comLike\">news@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-4190103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6391-NP41-F103-350R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Williams Lake Tribune Advisor</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 25, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000671</classCode><className>EXERCISE &amp; FITNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000479</classCode><className>DESERTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N112111MM</classCode><className>BEEF CATTLE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIO</classCode><className>GRAZING MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I say was because on June 30 it burned to the ground,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s partial remarks read, referring to a devastating stretch of days in the central B.C. community where temperatures rose to 49.6 C before the town was ignited in a forest fire.</p><p>But Brown said that although many of the structures in the village\u2019s centre are gone, the community that made up Lytton is still here.</p><p>\u201cLytton still exists. Yes, 90 per cent of the downtown core of the Village of Lytton and Lytton First Nation IR 17 and 18 burned in the fire on June 30, but the community of Lytton remains strong,\u201d she said, adding that at least 50 people whose homes did not burn down still live in Lytton.</p><p>\u201cThe community of Lytton, in the direct vicinity of the exclusion zone, is still very much alive.\u201d</p><p>Brown was born in Lytton in a house that her parents moved into in 1990.</p><p>\u201cThis is the same house they escaped from on June 30, 2021,\u201d she noted.</p><p>Brown also aimed her frustrations at what she called the \u201cbureaucratic red tape\u201d that has prevented the residents from rebuilding their lives. She cited a July 1 conversation that Trudeau had with Premier John Horgan where he \u201cassured Premier Horgan of the Government of Canada\u2019s support for the people of Lytton and all those affected by the fires.\u201d</p><p>However, Brown said that aid has not been forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cThough you committed that support, community members have not seen it,\u201d she said, adding that Trudeau also chose not to stop in Lytton for any of his recent trips to B.C. , included to Surrey in July, Tofino in September and to Kamloops last month.</p><p>The province has provided some support for the Lytton evacuees; in July, that government committed $2,000 to households impacted by that wildfire and other aid, including housing, has been provided through Emergency Support Services.</p><p>In October, the province appointed Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness, and Roly Russell, Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development, to act as recovery liaisons between the government and the village.</p><p>\u201cWe all want to see Lytton rebuilt and re-built quickly. But the reality is that housing solutions take time. There will be bumps along the road to recovery,\u201d Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said in an Oct. 27 statement.</p><p>Earlier this summer, both the province and the feds pledged to match British Columbians\u2019 donations to the Canadian Red Cross wildfire fund, up to a total of $20 million, to help those affected by wildfires across B.C. , including Lytton.</p><p>Many of the other efforts however, have been grassroots, whether at the local Lytton level or by fundraising efforts across the province that have ranged from lemonade stands to GoFundMes.</p><p>The prime minister\u2019s office said that the federal government has provided aid to Lytton and the surrounding areas, citing the matching funds for the Canadian Red Cross and the immediate presence of the Canadian Armed Forces on the ground in Lytton this past summer.</p><p>\u201cThe Canada Revenue Agency implemented emergency tax measures to support Canadians whose primary concern was taking care of their families, homes and communities,\u201d the PMO said in a statement. \u201cIndigenous Services Canada is working with local Indigenous communities and has provided millions to support the Lytton First Nation in immediate recovery. We are also committed to support their interim housing strategy, providing mental health supports to community members.

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver\u2014a moderate climate\u2014and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \"work\" as a clerk in my dad's general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don't have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p><p>David Zirnhelt is a rancher, member of the Cariboo Cattlemen's Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake.</p><p>Read More: Ranch Musings: Drought and the perilous bounty</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@wltribune.com\">news@wltribune.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 Williams Lake Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20210725PWL4190103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6374-8GV1-F0HF-83T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"482\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

I say was because on June 30 it burned to the ground,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s partial remarks read, referring to a devastating stretch of days in the central B.C. community where temperatures rose to 49.6 C before the town was ignited in a forest fire.</p><p>But Brown said that although many of the structures in the village\u2019s centre are gone, the community that made up Lytton is still here.</p><p>\u201cLytton still exists. Yes, 90 per cent of the downtown core of the Village of Lytton and Lytton First Nation IR 17 and 18 burned in the fire on June 30, but the community of Lytton remains strong,\u201d she said, adding that at least 50 people whose homes did not burn down still live in Lytton.</p><p>\u201cThe community of Lytton, in the direct vicinity of the exclusion zone, is still very much alive.\u201d</p><p>Brown was born in Lytton in a house that her parents moved into in 1990.</p><p>\u201cThis is the same house they escaped from on June 30, 2021,\u201d she noted.</p><p>Brown also aimed her frustrations at what she called the \u201cbureaucratic red tape\u201d that has prevented the residents from rebuilding their lives. She cited a July 1 conversation that Trudeau had with Premier John Horgan where he \u201cassured Premier Horgan of the Government of Canada\u2019s support for the people of Lytton and all those affected by the fires.\u201d</p><p>However, Brown said that aid has not been forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cThough you committed that support, community members have not seen it,\u201d she said, adding that Trudeau also chose not to stop in Lytton for any of his recent trips to B.C. , included to Surrey in July, Tofino in September and to Kamloops last month.</p><p>The province has provided some support for the Lytton evacuees; in July, that government committed $2,000 to households impacted by that wildfire and other aid, including housing, has been provided through Emergency Support Services. In October, the province appointed Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness, and Roly Russell, Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development, to act as recovery liaisons between the government and the village.</p><p>\u201cWe all want to see Lytton rebuilt and rebuilt quickly. But the reality is that housing solutions take time. There will be bumps along the road to recovery,\u201d Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said in an Oct. 27 statement.</p><p>Earlier this summer, both the province and the feds pledged to match British Columbians\u2019 donations to the Canadian Red Cross wildfire fund, up to a total of $20 million, to help those affected by wildfires across B.C. , including Lytton.</p><p>Many of the other efforts however, have been grassroots, whether at the local Lytton level or by fundraising efforts across the province that have ranged from lemonade stands to GoFundMes.</p><p>The prime minister\u2019s office said that the federal government has provided aid to Lytton and the surrounding areas, citing the matching funds for the Canadian Red Cross and the immediate presence of the Canadian Armed Forces on the ground in Lytton this past summer.</p><p>\u201cThe Canada Revenue Agency implemented emergency tax measures to support Canadians whose primary concern was taking care of their families, homes and communities,\u201d the PMO said in a statement. \u201c Indigenous Services Canada is working with local Indigenous communities and has provided \u201cThe community of Lytton, in the direct vicinity of the exclusion zone, is still very much alive.\u201d</p><p>Sarah Brown</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-news20211112PQJA0002222110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:642N-XXS1-JD2C-J00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It comprises 6,378 hectares and has a multitude of public trails of varying degrees of difficulty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forest is located within Tree Farm Licence (TFL) 44 and is separated into two distinct areas:Sproat Operating Area and Taylor Operating Area.</p><p>The Sproat Operating Area is located approximately 11 km northwest of Port Alberni, north of Highway 4, opposite Sproat Lake Landing. It slopes southward from the height of land between the Great Central Lake watershed, and Highway 4 and is bounded to the east by private land owned by Island Timberlands, and to the west by Friesen Creek. The area encompasses 3000 hectares.</p><p>The Taylor Operating Area slopes northward from the height of land between Mount Klitsa and Adder Mountain, and Highway 4 at Sutton Creek and the Taylor River. It is bounded to the east by Klitsa Creek and to the west by a southeast to northwest line running along the height of land from Adder Mountain to Sutton Pass east of the boundary of Clayoquot Sound. The area encompasses 3378 hectares.</p><p>The AVCF has an annual allowable cut of 19,000 cubic metres, but Law says they stick to 10,000 cubic metres or less \u201cwhich is what we feel is a sustainable rate of harvest.\u201d The idea behind the community forest was to put control of land and resources in local hands while creating a viable timber and non-timber forest resource business. The City of Port Alberni is the sole owner of the forest.</p><p>Law, his crews and contractors have a symbiotic relationship with the public when it comes to getting work accomplished within the working forest. Whether it\u2019s stacking wood for people to cut under permit or ensuring the vast trail system is safe for users, Law always has the public in mind.</p><p>The firewood cutting program was more popular than ever in 2020 as more people stuck close to home, Law said. The AVCF works with the Ministry of Forests, Lands and National Resource Operations, which issues firewood cutting permits.</p><p>In 2020 crews moved waste wood to the side of the logging roads within the forest for safe public access. Providing this waste wood reduces the need to bum slash piles so it reduces forest fire risk, Law said. This also helped cut down on fire hazard.</p><p>It is important to only cut in the areas indicated on maps provided on the AVCF web page, found at communityforest.ca/firewood.</p><p>Permits may be filled out online on the South Island Forest District web page (search \u201cpersonal use firewood cutting on Crown land\u201d) or in person at the Port Alberni office, 4885 Cherry Creek Rd.</p><p>The Weiner Creek and Bookout Creek areas are most popular with outdoor recreation enthusiasts, whether it be walkers, hikers or in winter, skiers and snowshoers.

I say was because on June 30 it burned to the ground,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s partial remarks read, referring to a devastating stretch of days in the central B.C. community where temperatures rose to 49.6 C before the town was ignited in a forest fire.</p><p>But Brown said that although many of the structures in the village\u2019s centre are gone, the community that made up Lytton is still here.</p><p>\u201cLytton still exists. Yes, 90 per cent of the downtown core of the Village of Lytton and Lytton First Nation IR 17 and 18 burned in the fire on June 30, but the community of Lytton remains strong,\u201d she said, adding that at least 50 people whose homes did not burn down still live in Lytton.</p><p>\u201cThe community of Lytton, in the direct vicinity of the exclusion zone, is still very much alive.\u201d</p><p>Brown was born in Lytton in a house that her parents moved into in 1990.</p><p>\u201cThis is the same house they escaped from on June 30, 2021,\u201d she noted.</p><p>Brown also aimed her frustrations at what she called the \u201cbureaucratic red tape\u201d that has prevented the residents from rebuilding their lives. She cited a July 1 conversation that Trudeau had with Premier John Horgan where he \u201cassured Premier Horgan of the Government of Canada\u2019s support for the people of Lytton and all those affected by the fires.\u201d</p><p>However, Brown said that aid has not been forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cThough you committed that support, community members have not seen it,\u201d she said, adding that Trudeau also chose not to stop in Lytton for any of his recent trips to B.C. , included to Surrey in July, Tofino in September and to Kamloops last month.</p><p>The province has provided some support for the Lytton evacuees; in July, that government committed $2,000 to households impacted by that wildfire and other aid, including housing, has been provided through Emergency Support Services.</p><p>In October, the province appointed Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness, and Roly Russell, Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development, to act as recovery liaisons between the government and the village.</p><p>\u201cWe all want to see Lytton rebuilt and rebuilt quickly. But the reality is that housing solutions take time. There will be bumps along the road to recovery,\u201d Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said in an Oct. 27 statement.</p><p>Earlier this summer, both the province and the feds pledged to match British Columbians\u2019 donations to the Canadian Red Cross wildfire fund, up to a total of $20 million, to help those affected by wildfires across B.C. , including Lytton.</p><p>Many of the other efforts however, have been grassroots, whether at the local Lytton level or by fundraising efforts across the province that have ranged from lemonade stands to GoFundMes.</p><p>The prime minister\u2019s office said that the federal government has provided aid to Lytton and the surrounding areas, citing the matching funds for the Canadian Red Cross and the immediate presence of the Canadian Armed Forces on the ground in Lytton this past summer.</p><p>\u201cThe Canada Revenue Agency implemented emergency tax measures to support Canadians whose primary concern was taking care of their families, homes and communities,\u201d the PMO said in a statement. \u201cIndigenous Services Canada is working with local Indigenous communities and has provided millions to support the Lytton First Nation in immediate recovery. We are also committed to support their interim housing strategy, providing mental health supports to community members. We stand by to provide further assistance as necessary.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KLOWNA-news20211111PQMA0002219426</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KLOWNA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:642G-YNX1-JD2C-J1ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

But it continued to get hotter and hotter until his cherries began to wilt.</p><p>He estimates that the impact of the heat dome \u2013 which has shattered record highs and exacerbated wildfires across the province \u2013has resulted in a loss of $800,000 just from cherries alone.</p><p>\u201cThis year is totally the most stressful year of my life,\u201d he said.</p><p>And he\u2019s worried that the harvesting season will only get worse.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working the same way. We cannot stop anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do the same spray. We do not stop anything. My workers are ready to go. I don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Gill\u2019s farming experience during the unprecedented heatwave is not an isolated event.</p><p>Glen Lucas, the general manager of the BC Fruit Grower\u2019s Association, said there are widespread reports across the province of heat damage to apple and cherry crops.</p><p>\u201cThere will be heat damage to the other crops as well, but right now, apples and cherries is what we\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cSunburn is happening on the fruit itself. The heat was so intense last week that the fruit actually got sunburned.\u201d Farms located in regions across the south Okanagan, he said, were hit the hardest.</p><p>\u201cThat would be from Penticton, south \u2013 or even Summerland, south,\u201d he said. \u201cDown in Oliver and Osoyoos, it got very intensely hot. We had temperature extremes that were record-setting.</p><p>\u201cThis was not something that we had experienced before.\u201d</p><p>However, he said fruit growers have no choice but to continue on the same course, with many seeking assistance from crop insurance and field adjusters.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a reprieve from the intense heat, so they are continuing with their harvests,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the south, they\u2019ve had to abandon and stop harvesting, so now they\u2019re in that recovery mode.\u201d</p><p>Then there\u2019s the smoke from wildfires burning across the province, another threat that farmers have to navigate on top of sweltering heat.</p><p>\u201cWe dug out our smoke advisory on keeping healthy and safe during forest fire season, from both forest fires and smoke,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our big concerns is keeping both the owners of the orchards \u2013 the farmers, their families \u2013 and the workers safe.\u201d</p><p>If the trend of extreme heat carries on through the beginning of September, he expects sunburn issues to persist.</p><p>\u201cBut hopefully, the weather moderates and we will be able to recover on those late-season cherries and get that harvest completed with some damage, but not the extreme damage that happened to the earlier season cherries when we had those very intense heats at the wrong moment in harvest when the cherries were ripe,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cIf we can avoid that, that would be what every grower is hoping for right now.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KEMREV-news20210715PQNA0002010315</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KEMREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6350-M6M1-F0HF-806W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438251</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Rock Sampling: Property Examination by Graeme Evans, P.Geo, June 2005 on behalf of Teck Cominco</p><p>Samples processed at ALS Laboratories Kamloops 2005, Job V050413R</p><p>Numerous pits, shafts and adits, including the 251 m long Betts adit, are evidence of historic exploration on the property, however there has been little systematic modern exploration work completed. Previous exploration on the property has identified several styles of mineralization including copper-gold skarn mineralization, massive sulfide zones (pyrite, pyrrhotite) and epithermal alteration (silicification and veining). Free gold is reported in samples from the western part of the claims A mineralized quartz feldspar porphyry dyke has also returned elevated values of copper mineralization, and could suggest porphyry mineralization potential.</p><p>In 2020, Belmont completed an airborne magnetic survey and a Lidar survey over the property. Numerous features of interest were defined by the surveys, which are assisting in geological mapping and interpretation in areas of cover. An extensive rock-sampling program is currently underway, which will target areas of identified skarn mineralization and epithermal alteration, as well as features of interest from the magnetic and Lidar surveys.</p><p>The sampling program will be followed by an IP survey, which was originally scheduled for June of this year, but was suddenly cancelled due to unusual high temperatures and forest fire danger rating in the project area. The objective of the IP survey is to map the resistivity and chargeability distribution and provide specific diamond drill targets.</p><p>Click Image To View Full Size</p><p>CBC 2020 Magnetic Inversion - Vertical Section</p><p>About Belmont Resources</p><p>Belmont Resources is engaged in the business of acquiring and re-developing past producing copper-gold-silver mines in southern British Columbia and Northern Washington State.

State of Emergency to bring attention to more than 300 fires burning across the province - 60 of them in the Cariboo.</p><p>CRD Chair Margo Wagner said the board voted Friday morning to send a letter to the Premier, following on the heels of a local CRD state of emergency for the region issued Thursday night. The Thompson Nicola Regional District Board also voted to send a letter seeking a provincial SoE declaration Thursday, while the District of 100 Mile Council passed a similar resolution Friday.</p><p>The call comes as Environment Canada predicts a 60 per cent chance of rain with a risk of thunderstorm for 100 Mile House Friday afternoon and evening. Environment Canada also issued a special air quality statement for the area due to wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours.</p><p>\"It raises the concerns and profile of the province that we're in a major state of emergency,\" Wagner said. \"My concern is post 2021 because we still have a lot of mental health issues still carried over form 2017, there's still lot of triggers going on - the fires are close and stressing people out and then we had COVID. It will help post-fire to get more help, to get resources in for mental health.\"</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service is battling nine wildfires of note in the Cariboo Fire District, including a 10,000-hectare Flat Lake blaze that has resulted in evacuation orders for Flat Lake-Green Lake North and evacuation alerts for the District of 100 Mile House and Horse Lake Road. Other evacuations or alerts are in effect as a result of fires south of Canim Lake, near Young Lake, the Chasm and Big Stick Lake.</p><p>READ MORE: Update: 'Fire of note' near Chasm grows to 374 hectares</p><p>The City of Williams Lake added its support for a State of Emergency Friday night.</p><p>\"Declaring a provincial state of emergency helps ensure that communities in need of resources have the means to assist the response efforts and support those who are displaced and affected by the fires,\" said Mayor Walt Cobb. \"With the hot, dry weather continuing, we must be prepared to hit these fires hard and get the situation under control the best we can.\"</p><p>Emergency Management B.C. said in an email to the Free Press Friday that the province is currently deploying all available resources to respond to wildfires across B.C., and that this can be done without a provincial state of emergency.</p><p>\"A provincial declaration of a state of emergency has not been necessary to provide assistance to people, to access funding, or to coordinate or obtain additional resources \u2013 including federal assets,\" the email stated. \"The federal government and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre are providing firefighting personnel, aircraft support, and other assets.\"</p><p>Premier John Horgan also said Friday that firefighters from Quebec and Mexico are en route to assist with local efforts.</p><p>With a file from Canadian Press</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kelly.sinoski@100milefreepress.net\">kelly.sinoski@100milefreepress.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2021 100 Mile House Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20210716PAA4186441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6356-J9S1-F0HF-8449-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

But they\u2019re too soft now \u2013 that\u2019s the heat,\u201d said Gill, who co-owns Kelowna\u2019s Farming Karma alongside his wife, Kuku.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Initially, when temperatures began to rise in June, Gill said he welcomed the heat, seeing as the past two seasons were jeopardized by frost and excessive rain damage. But it continued to get hotter and hotter until his cherries began to wilt.</p><p>He estimates that the impact of the heat dome \u2013 which has shattered record highs and exacerbated wildfires across the province \u2013 has resulted in a loss of $800,000 just from cherries alone.</p><p>\u201cThis year is totally the most stressful year of my life,\u201d he said.</p><p>And he\u2019s worried that the harvesting season will only get worse.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working the same way. We cannot stop anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do the same spray. We do not stop anything. My workers are ready to go. I don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Gill\u2019s farming experience during the unprecedented heatwave is not an isolated event.</p><p>Glen Lucas, the general manager of the BC Fruit Grower\u2019s Association, said there are widespread reports across the province of heat damage to apple and cherry crops.</p><p>\u201cThere will be heat damage to the other crops as well, but right now, apples and cherries is what we\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Lucas.</p><p>\u201cSunburn is happening on the fruit itself. The heat was so intense last week that the fruit actually got sunburned.\u201d</p><p>Farms located in regions across the south Okanagan, he said, were hit the hardest.</p><p>\u201cThat would be from Penticton, south \u2013 or even Summerland, south. Down in Oliver and Osoyoos, it got very intensely hot. We had temperature extremes that were record-setting.</p><p>\u201cThis was not something that we had experienced before.\u201d</p><p>However, Lucas said fruit growers have no choice but to continue on the same course, with many seeking assistance from crop insurance and field adjusters.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a reprieve from the intense heat, so they are continuing with their harvests,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the south, they\u2019ve had to abandon and stop harvesting, so now they\u2019re in that recovery mode.\u201d</p><p>Then there\u2019s the smoke from wildfires burning across the province, another threat that farmers have to navigate on top of sweltering heat.</p><p>\u201cWe dug out our smoke advisory on keeping healthy and safe during forest fire season, from both forest fires and smoke,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of our big concerns is keeping both the owners of the orchards \u2013 the farmers, their families \u2013 and the workers safe.\u201d If the trend of extreme heat carries on through the beginning of September, he expects sunburn issues to persist.</p><p>\u201cBut hopefully, the weather moderates and we will be able to recover on those late-season cherries and get that harvest completed with some damage, but not the extreme damage that happened to the earlier season cherries when we had those very intense heats at the wrong moment in harvest when the cherries were ripe,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cIf we can avoid that, that would be what every grower is hoping for right now.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENNWS-news20210714PRRA0002007657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634X-8MX1-JD2C-J02H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438267</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

So far this year, the province has seen 354 wildfires \u2014 nearly 150 above the five-year average. </p><p>Steve Roberts, vice-president of operations for the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency, says this week's weather forecast offers no reprieve. </p><p>\"The weather in Saskatchewan is going to continue to be mainly hot and dry,\" he said Wednesday. \"There will be isolated storm systems that will pass through \u2014 nothing significant. </p><p>\"The small systems that we've been seeing for the last number of days are producing a slight amount of precipitation, but they are also producing lightning, which is giving us new fire starts.\"</p><p>In northern Saskatchewan, dozens of homes have been evacuated as fires burn close to communities. </p><p>Evacuees are currently being sheltered in North Battleford and Lloydminster. The agency has also been co-ordinating bus transportation out of some communities. </p><p>Portions of Highways 102 and 106 are under threat from multiple fires and may need to be closed if the situation worsens.</p><p>Because of the extreme fire risk, Roberts said a provincial fire ban will remain in place for at least another three to five days. </p><p>The agency said many firefighters in the province have been working for two or three weeks straight.</p><p>\"We're going to have to provide our crews an opportunity to get a couple of days off, get rested and get refreshed before we can put them back on the line,\" said Roberts. </p><p>According to the agency, the province employs a total of 240 firefighters, as well as 85 crews in northern communities. At this point, \"all of those resources are currently engaged on ... fires,\" he said.</p><p>The province is looking to hire residents with firefighting training from northern communities and borrow staff from local fire departments.</p><p>Roberts said local firefighters can help keep a more contained fire under control, which would free up provincial crews that may be needed elsewhere.</p><p>The province is also asking for resources from outside of Saskatchewan. </p><p>But a hot, dry wildfire season throughout Western Canada has made that more difficult. </p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which helps co-ordinate resource sharing between agencies, says provinces are having to make hard choices between helping their neighbours and keeping their fire crews close to home. </p><p>\"Currently there is fire activity or potential for fire activity in most agencies from Ontario westward,\" the centre said in an email. \"This situation is making it very difficult for these agencies to loan their resources.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened the Incident Response Group to discuss wildfires and extreme weather throughout Canada. </p><p>The federal government says it is committed to monitoring the situation and providing resources as needed. </p><p>Evacuees who need to access government assistance, redirect their benefits to a new address or who have lost documents during the evacuation can call the Service Canada Outreach Support Centre at 1-800-O-Canada (1-800-622-6263).</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 14, 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a16a494c805e43f5b795f49b237bff87</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634X-SCN1-DY9S-T3KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>06:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 14, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The message from Mother Nature was unmistakable: \"Act immediately to mitigate climate change.\"</p><p>To heed nature's warning, I propose the \"Lytton test.\"</p><p>Whatever we're planning to do collectively, we must ask: Will this help avoid another Lytton? Will it provide protection during another Lytton-like event? Does it consume resources that would be better spent mitigating the climate crisis?</p><p>If we utilize this test on the spectacularly expensive purchase of 88 new fighter jets, the Liberal's plan fails on all three fronts.</p><p>Fighter jets can't protect us from another Lytton-like catastrophe. They can't extinguish fires, carry personnel to disaster zones or offer effective search and rescue. They are offensive weapons designed to enhance the Canadian Air Force's ability to participate in future U.S. and NATO-led wars.</p><p>Rather than protect Canadians from the devastation experienced by the people of Lytton, purchasing cutting-edge fighter jets increases the likelihood of another climate disaster.</p><p>To fly at high speeds and altitudes, fighter jets consume incredible amounts of specialized fuel. The heavy carbon-emitting fuels' high-altitude release point also has a greater warming effect. Most fuel is consumed in training, but during the 2011 bombing of Libya, the Air Force's jets consumed 8.5 million litres of fuel.</p><p>The planned purchase would be the second largest procurement in Canadian history, diverting resources from efforts to mitigate the prospect of future Lyttons. The government says it plans to spend $19 billion on new jets. But that's just the sticker price. Depending on whether they select Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter, Saab's Gripen or Boeing's Super Hornet, the true cost could be four times greater. According to a recent report released by the No Fighter Jets Coalition, the life cycle cost is estimated at $77 billion. Those resources could turbocharge a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Moving forward with this purchase is a decision we will soon regret. Fortunately, there's growing opposition.</p><p>A public letter released this week by the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute and the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace opposes the purchase. \"As wildfires blaze in Western Canada amidst record breaking heat waves, the Liberal government is planning to spend tens of billions of dollars on unnecessary, dangerous, climate-destroying fighter jets,\" begins a letter addressed to Trudeau.</p><p>Initiating signatories include Canadian musicians Neil Young, Sarah Harmer and Tegan and Sara, as well as authors Yann Martel, Gabor Mat\u00e9 and Michael Ondaatje. The No New Fighter Jets for Canada statement is also signed by environmentalists David Suzuki and Naomi Klein, two sitting MPs, four former MPs, a senator and former diplomat Stephen Lewis. Prominent international figures like rock legend Roger Waters, actress Daryl Hannah and academic Noam Chomsky have also endorsed the call.</p><p>What happened in Lytton must prompt a profound rethink in government policy. Buying 88 offensive, unnecessary and climate-destroying fighter jets certainly doesn't meet the Lytton test.</p><p>Bianca Mugyenyi is director of the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20210716TTAWc8556a86bb004d5ea795deab8bedbba4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6356-HNW1-F197-53CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Arizona, Idaho and Montana accounted for more than half of the large active fires.</p><p>The fires erupted as the West was in the grip of the second bout of dangerously high temperatures in just a few weeks. A climate change-fueled megadrought also is contributing to conditions that make fires even more dangerous, scientists say.</p><p>The National Weather Service said the heat wave had peaked in many areas, and remaining excessive heat warnings were expected to expire by Tuesday night.</p><p>\u201cWhile we are eagerly anticipating a cooling trend over the next few days, we still have another hot day to get through,\u201d the Medford, Oregon, weather office said. </p><p>The largest fire in the United States was burning in rural southwestern Oregon. The Bootleg Fire \u2014 which has ravaged about 316 square miles (818 square kilometers), an area more than twice the size of Portland \u2014 threatened some 2,000 homes, state fire officials said. It had burned about 21 homes homes as well as other minor structures, fire spokesman Daniel Omdal said Tuesday.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling to build containment lines and hadn\u2019t managed to surround any of the fire burning in the Fremont-Winema National Forest, near the Klamath County town of Sprague River. </p><p>\u201cWe are under extreme weather conditions. The humidity is low, the fuels are highly flammable and all those provide conditions for significant fire activity,\u201d Omdal said. </p><p>The fire disrupted service on three transmission lines providing up to 5,500 megawatts of electricity to California, and that state's power grid operator asked for voluntary power conservation Monday evening. The operator reported that more than 44,500 megawatts were available Tuesday. </p><p>In Northern California, a combined pair of lightning-ignited blazes dubbed the Beckwourth Complex was 26% surrounded after days of battling flames in windy, hot and dry weather that sapped moisture from vegetation. Evacuation orders were in place for more than 3,000 residents of remote northern areas and neighboring Nevada.</p><p>There were reports of burned homes, but damage was still being tallied. The blaze had scorched more than 145 square miles (375 square kilometers) of land, including in Plumas National Forest, and containment jumped to 46%.</p><p>A fire that began Sunday in the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite National Park grew to nearly 15 square miles (39 square kilometers) but containment increased to 15%. Four unspecified buildings were destroyed.</p><p>Elsewhere, a forest fire started during lightning storms in southeast Washington grew to 86 square miles (223 square kilometers). It was 20% contained Monday. </p><p>Another fire west of Winthrop closed the scenic North Cascades Highway, the most northern route through the Cascade Range. The road provides access to North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. </p><p>In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little mobilized the National Guard to help fight twin lightning-sparked fires that have together charred nearly 24 square miles (62 square kilometers) of dry timber in the remote, drought-stricken region.</p><p>___</p><p>AP journalist Julie Walker contributed to this report from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-92bec84b0705a4b16312fb52d6e8b5c4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634P-SS91-DY9S-T3XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>11:38 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 13, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Nov. 8, 21 speed cameras of 22 were activated.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Hard-hit Lombardy and Piemonte kept their bookshops and stationary shops closed, while central Lazio postponed any opening for another week to allow stores to put in place sanitary measures to protect both staff and shoppers alike. Veneto was allowing them to open two days a week under a gradual loosening that the governor termed 'lockdown light.' Another segment of workers allowed back on the job Tuesday were forestry workers, to clear dead trees ahead of the warming weather that brings with it forest fire season. While the list of commercial activities allowed to reopen seemed random, officials offered the explanation that students needed to restock up on school supplies, new parents needed to outfit their growing babies. And Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini argued that books were an 'essential good' for Italians cooped up at home. 'The same distancing and security measures as supermarkets will be required, but they'll reopen,' Franceschini tweeted. 'It's not a symbolic gesture, but the recognition that even books are an essential good.' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TAPM116028158687464016125876100132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TAPM-116028</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNH-DM51-JCMN-Y29R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"257\"/><timeReceived>2:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Talking Points Memo</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Italy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>2020 COVID Outbreak AP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID-19</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Workers' Compensation &amp; SSDI</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTNGOEUzQTYwRUQ1NEFCN0FGMjg0Rjc5MjI3NjBDMEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Reopenings</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzEzMzVGNDk2MDFGNEIxN0FGMzkxRUM5NzA0RUI5QjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDE2MDQ4NUQ2NEJDNDYyMEI3ODE3RTRBNkRDQ0EzMkY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOZB</classCode><className>SOCIAL DISTANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9C</classCode><className>GOVERNORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N4491211M</classCode><className>BOOKSTORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000154</classCode><className>BABY PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N445110MM</classCode><className>GROCERY STORES &amp; SUPERMARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It is simply to thin out the forest and make it safer for some of our more high population areas.\"</p><p>Of particular concern is the density of brush around the Pine Grove Correctional Centre. The area east of the facility will be the first to thinned, starting in about two weeks.</p><p>\"Crews will be in there with chainsaws and some small equipment. Their job is to specifically go in and thin out the forest itself,\" Yeaman said. \"Pine Grove Correctional Centre is certainly at risk from forest fire if we didn't go in and do anything with this area whatsoever.\"</p><p>While a lot of the targeted clearing involves deadfall, occasionally some older standing timber is also cut. To determine how to best decide what to cut and what to leave, the City is working with the SPSA.</p><p>The SPSA has specialists in fire management that have given the City some good advice on what should be cut.</p><p>\"They're the project lead. We work with their experts because they have the foremost knowledge on Fire Smart practices, where we should be looking at actually applying this practice too and what areas of the forest that fall within the municipality,\" said Yeaman.</p><p>Fire Smart is a program that started in Alberta in 1990 as the province worked to manage what is called the Wildland/Urban Interface, or the area where humans and nature overlap.</p><p>Disasters such as the burning of the town of Slave Lake in 2011 followed by the fire that also destroyed part of Fort McMurray in 2016 highlighted the need to protect communities that are surrounded by forest.</p><p>Clearing dead trees and cutting some trees that accelerate the spread of wildfire for a limited distance around a community can reduce the risk substantially.</p><p>While some of the projects in the Fire Smart program require municipal or other level of government to be involved, some are up to home owners such as not stacking firewood next to house or limiting highly flammable shrubs near buildings.</p><p>Part of what the City could do in the near future is also an educational component, Yeaman explained.</p><p>\"Internally we're working with fire services management team to look at what other particular areas we should be looking at,\" he said.</p><p>Over the next five years, Prince Albert will spend just over $30,000 annually with the federal government also kicking in $21,000 per year for Fire Smart projects.</p><p>This year, six hectares east of Pine Grove will be targeted and next year they will look at the area north of the prison going up to the parking lot at Little Red River park.</p><p>After that they have their eye on the area north of the Lakeland ball diamonds.</p><p>The following years have yet to be determined but they expect every year it will be between six and eight hectares, as the funding allows.</p><p>A wildfire north of Prince Albert earlier this spring served to highlight what they already have known for years, that the land north of the river was a high risk area that needed addressing.</p><p>\"In talking with the fire chief, I know that Little Red has been a concern for years. Anything north of the river has been a concern for years because there have been wildfires,\" Yeaman said. \"This year just highlighted the need that we need to be a little more pro-active, that we certainly need to focus in and strategize.\"</p><p>Work will start in the fall because that is when contractors are available and it still allows for time to dispose of slash piles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20211101TTAW964dca79a2424605a73536a4cf14444f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:640B-2TK1-F197-543Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"651\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It is simply to thin out the forest and make it safer for some of our more high population areas.\u201d </p><p> Of particular concern is the density of brush around the Pine Grove Correctional Centre. The area east of the facility will be the first to thinned, starting in about two weeks.  </p><p> \u201cCrews will be in there with chainsaws and some small equipment. Their job is to specifically go in and thin out the forest itself,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cPine Grove Correctional Centre is certainly at risk from forest fire if we didn\u2019t go in and do anything with this area whatsoever.\u201d </p><p> While a lot of the targeted clearing involves deadfall, occasionally some older standing timber is also cut. To determine how to best decide what to cut and what to leave, the City is working with the SPSA. </p><p> The SPSA has specialists in fire management that have given the City some good advice on what should be cut.  </p><p> \u201cThey\u2019re the project lead. We work with their experts because they have the foremost knowledge on Fire Smart practices, where we should be looking at actually applying this practice too and what areas of the forest that fall within the municipality,\u201d said Yeaman.  </p><p>Fire Smart is a program that started in Alberta in 1990 as the province worked to manage what is called the Wildland/Urban Interface, or the area where humans and nature overlap.  </p><p>Disasters such as the burning of the town of Slave Lake in 2011 followed by the fire that also destroyed part of Fort McMurray in 2016 highlighted the need to protect communities that are surrounded by forest.  </p><p>Clearing dead trees and cutting some trees that accelerate the spread of wildfire for a limited distance around a community can reduce the risk substantially.  </p><p>While some of the projects in the Fire Smart program require municipal or other level of government to be involved, some are up to home owners such as not stacking firewood next to house or limiting highly flammable shrubs near buildings.  </p><p>Part of what the City could do in the near future is also an educational component, Yeaman explained.  </p><p>\u201cInternally we\u2019re working with fire services management team to look at what other particular areas we should be looking at,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Over the next five years, Prince Albert will spend just over $30,000 annually with the federal government also kicking in $21,000 per year for Fire Smart projects.  </p><p>This year, six hectares east of Pine Grove will be targeted and next year they will look at the area north of the prison going up to the parking lot at Little Red River park.  </p><p>After that they have their eye on the area north of the Lakeland ball diamonds.   </p><p>The following years have yet to be determined but they expect every year it will be between six and eight hectares, as the funding allows.  </p><p>A wildfire north of Prince Albert earlier this spring served to highlight what they already have known for years, that the land north of the river was a high risk area that needed addressing.  </p><p>\u201cIn talking with the fire chief, I know that Little Red has been a concern for years. Anything north of the river has been a concern for years because there have been wildfires,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cThis year just highlighted the need that we need to be a little more pro-active, that we certainly need to focus in and strategize.\u201d  </p><p>Work will start in the fall because that is when contractors are available and it still allows for time to dispose of slash piles.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-964dca79a2424605a73536a4cf14444f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:640C-K8Y1-DY9S-T0CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>09:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 1, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The requirements were: installing three streetlights; installing one of two fire hydrants; upgrading a water main from 100 millimeters to 200 mm and extending the storm sewer.</p><p>While council members expressed support for reducing the setback from Fifth Avenue, concerns were expressed about waiving other requirements.</p><p>Coun. Tim Lavery said storm water handling and fire hydrants would be two items he would have difficulty waiving, but street work would be a possibility. Lavery said he is struggling because the association is \"one of our premier community organizations, does incredibly good work on a key point of land and I want to find ways to support them.\"</p><p>Other council members also mentioned their high regard for the organization and fall fair.</p><p>Coun. Chad Eliason agreed with Lavery, noting the improvements required are expensive because the parcel has been under-serviced for years, something the board didn't realize. For him, the requirements he couldn't waive would be fire hydrants and street lights.</p><p>\"The worst time to get a fire hydrant variance is just after a heat wave in a high forest-fire season,\" Eliason remarked.</p><p>Coun. Sylvia Lindgren said she could likely support most of the variances other than storm water, and perhaps the city could help cover some expenses.</p><p>Mayor Alan Harrison expressed his appreciation for the agricultural association.</p><p>\"I think council all recognizes the value of SASLAA in the community and the fact this is a non profit; it puts a different light on it.\"</p><p>He asked that the fire chief be invited to the July 12 council meeting when the application would be complete and council would decide on it. He said he would follow whatever the fire chief recommends regarding fire hydrants.</p><p>Harrison described street lighting as crucial because Fifth Avenue is a heavily walked area. The handling of storm water is also important, he said, as \"we've all walked through big puddles on that site.\"</p><p>Jayme Franklin, president of the association's engineering firm, pointed out the issue with storm water goes back to when Fifth Street was built and all the catch basins drained water onto the property. He said one small building would have negligible impact.</p><p>Phil Wright, president of the SASLAA board, thanked council for the direction and said he and the engineering firm would see what they could come up with in the next week.</p><p>Read more: Salmon Arm fair returns for 2021</p><p>Read more: Salmon Arm's ROOTSandBLUES branches out for second online festival</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:martha.wickett@saobserver.net\">martha.wickett@saobserver.net</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Sign up for our newsletter to get Salmon Arm stories in your inbox every morning.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20210707PSB4181735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6338-TXP1-F0HF-81W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

With additional exploration, Agnico Eagle believes that mineralization will continue to be added into the overall mine plan in the coming years, with good potential to grow annual gold production and further extend the mine life.</p><p>Figure 1: Canadian Malartic Production Profile</p><p>Source: Agnico Eagle Press Release, June 20, 2023</p><p>In 2023, Agnico Eagle expects to spend approximately $21.8 million for 164,000 meters of drilling at Canadian Malartic and its adjoining properties. Approximately 95,030 meters were drilled during the first five months of 2023. Up to fifteen drills were active on Canadian Malartic and its surrounding properties during the same period, with five underground drills currently completing infill drilling on the Odyssey South deposit, four surface drills focused on completing infill drilling and transitioning to expand East Gouldie mineralization, and up to six drills active in regional exploration.</p><p>Drilling from underground in the Odyssey South deposit gradually increased during the first half of 2023 as ramp development provided access to new drill bays to test Odyssey South and Odyssey internal zones. As at May 31st, the ramp was 3,645 meters in length, reaching the bottom of the Odyssey South deposit at a depth of 578 meters. Shaft sinking activities started in March, with 55 meters completed as of June 20th. Underground infill drilling into Odyssey South continued to confirm the widths and grades of mineralization. With continued infill drilling success, Agnico Eagle's expectation is that Probable Mineral Reserves will continue to grow and replace 2023 production from that zone. Exploration drilling from the Odyssey ramp is also increasing confidence in the adjacent Odyssey internal zones and demonstrating good continuity of gold mineralization within these internal structures. The gold mineralization encountered to date in the Odyssey internal zones has not been included in the current mine plan and could represent an attractive near-term exploration opportunity considering the zone's proximity to existing and planned underground mine infrastructure around the Odyssey South and Odyssey North deposits. Agnico Eagle indicated that positive drill results at Odyssey internal zones show the potential to further increase production during the operation's 2023-2028 transition period.</p><p>Exploration at the Odyssey mine in 2023 is expected to include $11.8 million for 102,000 meters of drilling focused on the following four objectives:</p><p>Continued drilling into East Gouldie to convert additional Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources towards the outer portions of the deposit</p><p>Testing the immediate extensions of East Gouldie to the west and at shallower depths</p><p>Continued conversion drilling into extensions of Odyssey South; and</p><p>Further investigate Odyssey internal zones</p><p>Select intercepts from recent drilling at Odyssey are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 2: Canadian Malartic Long Section</p><p>Source: Agnico Eagle Press Release, June 20, 2023</p><p>Agnico Eagle continues to expect to have 40,000 tonnes per day ('tpd') of excess mill capacity starting in 2028 as processing of open pit ore and low-grade stockpiles gradually decreases and transitions to the higher-grade Odyssey underground mine. This additional mill capacity provides significant optionality for organic growth at Canadian Malartic and the greater land package. Agnico Eagle now controls 16.5 kilometers of continuous ground along the Cadillac-Larder Lake break at its Canadian Malartic and adjoining properties. Agnico Eagle has budgeted approximately $10 million in 2023 for 62,000 meters of regional exploration drilling on the Canadian Malartic, Rand Malartic, Camflo, Midway and East Amphi properties which offer potential opportunities to supplement the existing mine life with additional ore sources. Osisko holds 5% NSR royalties on East Amphi and Midway.</p><p>In addition to near-mill exploration, Agnico continues to explore the possibility of utilizing the excess mill and tailings storage capacity at Canadian Malartic to support other regional projects. Current internal studies include potential sources of ore from the Macassa near surface deposits and the AK deposit (2% NSR Royalty), the Upper Beaver project (2% NSR Royalty), other Kirkland Lake satellite deposits including Upper Canada and Anoki-McBean (2% NSR Royalties), as well as the Wasamac project. Osisko holds a $0.40 per tonne mill royalty on any ore processed at the Canadian Malartic mill that was not part of the initial Malartic property at the time of the sale to Yamana and Agnico Eagle in 2014.</p><p>Figure 3: Regional Pipeline ' Cadillac-Larder Lake Break</p><p>Source: Agnico Eagle Presentation 'Canadian Malartic Complex Mine Tour', June 21, 2023</p><p>CSA Initial Deliveries and Update (100% Silver Stream and 3.0% Copper Stream)</p><p>On June 16th, Osisko Bermuda Limited ('OBL') closed the previously announced silver purchase agreement (the 'Silver Stream') and copper purchase agreement (the 'Copper Stream') referenced to production from the CSA mine ('CSA') with Metals Acquisition Limited ('MAC'). Deliveries of refined silver to OBL under the Silver Stream will include approximately 1,527 GEOs in respect of silver produced at CSA between February 1st and June 15th. Deliveries of refined copper to OBL under the Copper Stream will commence in June 2024. Production in the first half of 2023 was impacted by planned downtime of the process plant to complete upgrades to the grinding circuit.</p><p>On June 27th, MAC announced that it had shipped its first shipment of concentrate to customers in Asia containing approximately 2,300 tonnes of copper and 28,000 ounces of silver. MAC has identified multiple opportunities to improve productivity, optimize costs, lower cut-off grade, increase the resource and extend the mine life at CSA.</p><p>Costa Fuego Royalty Acquisition (1.0% Copper NSR Royalty and 3.0% Gold NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 28th, Osisko announced a binding agreement to acquire a 1.0% copper NSR royalty and a 3.0% gold NSR royalty covering Hot Chili Limited's Costa Fuego Copper-Gold Project ('Costa Fuego') in Chile.</p><p>Costa Fuego is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper projects, not currently controlled by a major mining company. It hosts an NI 43-101 Indicated Resource including both the open pit and underground portions of the Cortadera and Productora deposits, of 725 million tonnes grading 0.47% Copper Equivalent ('CuEq'), grading 0.38% Copper, 0.11 g/t gold, 0.45 g/t silver and 93 ppm Molybdenum and an Inferred Resource of 202 million tonnes grading 0.30% copper and 0.06 g/t gold. The June 2023 PEA projects at 16 year mine life with average annual production of 95 thousand tonnes of copper and 49,000 ounces of gold in the first 14 years.</p><p>Costa Fuego is situated at low altitude and is in close proximity to all key infrastructure requirements. An updated resource is scheduled for late 2023 and will serve as the basis for a PFS, scheduled for completion in the second half of 2024.</p><p>Gibraltar Stream Increase (87.5% Silver Stream)</p><p>On June 29th, Osisko announced an amendment to its silver stream on the Gibraltar copper mine ('Gibraltar'). Osisko and Taseko Mines Limited ('Taseko') have amended the silver stream to increase Osisko's effective stream percentage by 12.5% to 87.5%. Further, the step-down silver delivery threshold has been extended to coincide with Taseko's recently updated mineral reserve estimate for Gibraltar.</p><p>Mantos Blancos Ramp Up (100% Silver Stream)</p><p>On May 3rd, Capstone Copper ('Capstone') discussed its progress on the ramp up at Mantos Blancos, including continued focus on preventative maintenance to increase reliability and reduce downtime. Average throughput during the first quarter was 16,023 tpd (compared to 15,246 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2022). The quarter included eighteen days operating at 20,000 tpd and an average throughput rate of 19,000 tpd in February. On their first quarter conference call, Capstone indicated that higher throughput at Mantos Blancos is anticipated over the balance of the year. OBL expects to see stronger deliveries under the stream in the second half of 2023.</p><p>Capstone is currently evaluating the potential to further increase throughput of the Mantos Blancos sulphide concentrator plant from 20,000 tpd to 27,000 tpd using idled mill capacity with the potential for additional production through 2032. The Mantos Blancos Phase II feasibility study is expected to be released in the second half of 2023.</p><p>Eagle Ramp Up (5.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On July 5th, Victoria Gold Corp. ('Victoria') reported second quarter production of 45,568 ounces of gold resulting in production of 83,188 ounces of gold during the first half of 2023. This represents a 47% improvement over the 56,413 ounces of gold produced in the first half of 2022. Both gold grade and metallurgical recovery continue to reconcile well against the Eagle reserve model.</p><p>Island Exploration Success (1.38% to 3.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 15th, Alamos Gold Inc. ('Alamos') reported new results from underground drilling at the Island Gold mine, further extending high-grade gold across the deposit, including several recently defined hanging wall and footwall structures in close proximity to existing underground infrastructure. Continued exploration success within recently defined sub-parallel structures demonstrates the significant opportunities to add high-grade ounces near existing mining horizons. This includes the newly defined NS1-Zone in the hanging wall which is currently being developed and mined; the zone is beyond existing Mineral Reserves and Resources and outside of the 2023 mine plan.</p><p>A total of $14 million is budgeted for exploration at Island Gold in 2023. For the past several years, the exploration focus has been on adding high-grade Mineral Resources at depth in advance of the Phase 3+ Expansion study, primarily through surface directional drilling. This exploration strategy has been successful in tripling the Mineral Reserve and Resource base since 2017. With a 17-year mine life, and with work on the expansion ramping up, the focus has shifted to an expanded underground exploration drilling program that will leverage existing underground infrastructure. The underground exploration drilling program has been expanded from 27,500 meters in 2022 to 45,000 meters in 2023 and is focused on defining new Mineral Reserves and Resources in proximity to existing production horizons and infrastructure including along strike, and in the hanging-wall and footwall. These potential high-grade Mineral Reserve and Resource additions would be low-cost to develop and could be incorporated into the mine plan and mined within the next several years.</p><p>Seabee Update (3% NSR Royalty)</p><p>During SSR Mining Inc.'s ('SSR Mining') first quarter conference call, it was mentioned that production during the quarter reflected an issue with underground equipment availability that negatively impacted the mine sequencing at Seabee. The issue was resolved, but grades processed were below expectations.</p><p>SSR Mining continues to advance near mine exploration at Seabee with a focus on prioritizing mineral resource conversion activities to ensure mineral reserve growth and mine life extensions in the future. They continue to evaluate early-stage exploration targets at depth below the existing Santoy mineralization as well as regional targets like Porky and Porky West that could contribute meaningfully to Seabee's longer-term production platform.</p><p>Lamaque Update (1% and 2.5% NSR Royalty)</p><p>During Eldorado Gold Corporation's ('Eldorado') first quarter conference call, management indicated that second quarter processing rates will increase slightly coupled with consistent grade and production for the second half of the year is expected to be stronger than the first half. Additionally, Eldorado is anticipating the delivery of the first electric haul truck in the second quarter and a second in the fourth quarter, which are expected to enhance haulage capabilities and reduce diesel consumption per tonne, lowering GHG emissions.</p><p>Eldorado also highlighted that exploration results at Ormaque continue to demonstrate the potential to increase resources. Partial results from resource conversion drilling will be incorporated in a resource update later in 2023 and a maiden reserve on Ormaque in 2024.</p><p>Renard Update (9.6% Diamond Stream)</p><p>On June 23rd, Stornoway made the decision to evacuate the Renard mine, located in central Qubec, due to forest fires located 50km to the northwest of the operation. Smoke from the fires as well as the closure of an important access road necessitated the interruption in site activities. Mining operations resumed on July 1st and the diamond recovery plant restarted on July 4th following the reopening of the access road allowing for the resumption of transportation of natural gas and diesel necessary for operations. As a result of the temporary evacuation, we anticipate a moderate impact on deliveries from Renard in the third quarter of 2023; we also note a general softening in the diamond market over the second quarter due to high polished inventory levels and a slower economic rebound in China.</p><p>Pan Mine (4.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 21st, Calibre Mining Corp. ('Calibre') announced assay results from the 2023 drill program at the Pan Mine in Nevada. Results at the Palomino target, located immediately south of the current open pit, indicate higher grades than the current average reserve grade of 0.4g/t gold. Currently a small amount of material at Palomino exists in Inferred Resources. The potential now exists to materially increase resource ounces, grade and confidence south of the Pan mine and the Palomino deposit remains open to the southeast and at shallow depths. Some highlight intercepts include 3.84 g/t gold over 15.2 meters, 2.08 g/t gold over 27.4 meters and 2.02 g/t gold over 27.4 meters. All drill targets are located near-surface in oxidized limestone. Given the proximity to the current open pit, and the fact that Palomino is within the permitted area, Calibre has indicated they could start mining at Palomino as early as 2024.</p><p>Windfall Joint Venture (2-3% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 5th, Osisko Mining Inc. ('Osisko Mining') announced the suspension of all activities at the Windfall project due to the wildfire situation in Northern Qubec. Facilities were monitored in accordance with local directives.</p><p>On May 2nd, Osisko Mining and Gold Fields Ltd. ('Gold Fields') announced a joint venture partnership (collectively 'the Partnership') to develop and mine the Windfall Project in Qubec, Canada. Gold Fields acquired a 50% interest in the feasibility stage Windfall Project (including exploration potential) on the following key terms:</p><p>cash payment of C$300 million paid on signing;</p><p>cash payment of C$300 million payable on issuance of key permits and,</p><p>50/50 co-share of interim and construction capital expenditures.</p><p>Gold Fields believes the Windfall Project is on track to become a high-quality, low-cost underground gold mine with a relatively small surface footprint and considerable growth prospects along strike and down plunge, well beyond delineated Mineral Reserves and the current 10 year projected mine life set out in Osisko Mining's December 2022 Windfall feasibility study. Drawing on more than 20 years of successful brownfields exploration and reserve growth at its Western Australian operations, Gold Fields sees the potential for a similar path to emerge at the Windfall, Urban Barry and Quvillon belts.</p><p>Property-wide regional and near-deposit exploration is already in progress, with six drills exploring targets developed by Osisko over the past seven years, including the Golden Bear, Fox and Shellian prospects. An initial exploration program developed by the Partnership includes $20 million dedicated to these and other targets.</p><p>Tintic Ramp Progress and Exploration Success (2.5% Metals Stream)</p><p>On May 17th, Osisko Development Corp. ('Osisko Development') announced the remaining diamond drilling ('DD') and reverse circulation ('RC') drill results from its 2022 exploration program, announced new 2023 underground diamond drilling results and provided an overview of the ongoing 2023 exploration program at its 100%-owned Trixie test mine ('Trixie') within the greater Tintic Project ('Tintic'). Highlights included 23.49 g/t gold and 58.79 g/t silver over 1.37 meters, 62.82 g/t gold and 231.46 g/t silver over 6.86 meters including 191 g/t gold and 707 g/t silver over 1.07 meters. Currently there are two underground diamond drill rigs in operation at Trixie conducting exploration activities.</p><p>Additionally, as of May 17th, approximately 75% of the Trixie portal and underground decline ramp had been completed and completion of the decline ramp to the main 625 level is anticipated by the third quarter of 2023, which is expected to significantly improve underground access for exploration drilling.</p><p>During 2022, Osisko Development completed an extensive review and compilation of historical data on the Tintic Project. As a result, a number of high-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver targets were identified at North Lily and Eureka Standard. Additionally, copper-molybdenum-gold porphyry targets were identified at Big Hill ' a lithocap approximately 2 kilometers in strike length and 1 kilometer wide indicative of an underlying porphyry system. A strong geophysical and geochemical target was also identified to the West and at depth below Trixie. An initial program of surface drilling is planned to test Big Hill, commencing in the third quarter of 2023.</p><p>Cariboo Permitting Update (5.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On May 8th, Osisko Development announced the signing of two permitting agreements, the Process Charter and the Joint Information Requirements Table, reaffirming the multilateral support of and commitment by the various levels of the Government of British Columbia to advance the approval process of the Cariboo Gold Project ('Cariboo'). The target timelines established by the Process Charter, which are contingent on the issuance of the Environmental Assessment Certificate anticipated in the third quarter of 2023, contemplate a final application referral date that is aligned with the anticipated receipt of environmental permits in Q1 2024.</p><p>Taylor Update (1% NSR Royalty on Sulphide Ores)</p><p>On May 8th, South32 Limited ('South32') announced that the Taylor project had been confirmed by the United States Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), as the first mining project added to the FAST-41 process, enabling a more efficient and transparent process for federal permitting. The Taylor project, located in Southern Arizona, is currently the only advanced mine development project in the US that could produce two federally designated critical minerals: zinc and manganese. To qualify for the FAST-41 process, complex critical infrastructure projects must meet rigorous criteria to demonstrate benefit to the United States.</p><p>In a recent presentation, South32 indicated that the Taylor feasibility study and a final investment decision is on track for the second half of 2023 incorporating the revised mine development schedule, which is being optimized for the FAST-41 permitting process.</p><p>On April 23rd, along with quarterly results, South32 indicated that US$173 million had been invested at the project in the nine months ended March 2023. Construction of the second water treatment plant progressed and remained on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p>Casino (2.75% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On April 14th, Western Copper and Gold Corporation ('Western Copper') announced the closing of the $21.3 million strategic equity investment by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation representing approximately 5.0% interest in Western Copper, to further advance the Casino Project.

Silver earned from royalty and stream agreements are converted to gold equivalent ounces by multiplying the silver ounces earned by the average silver price for the period and dividing by the average gold price for the period. Diamonds, other metals and cash royalties are converted into gold equivalent ounces by dividing the associated revenue earned by the average gold price for the period. Offtake agreements are converted using the financial settlement equivalent divided by the average gold price for the period. //st</p><p>Average Metal Prices and Exchange Rate</p><p>Three months ended</p><p>June 30</p><p>2023 2022 Gold(i) $1,976 $1,871 Silver(ii) $24.13 $22.60 Exchange rate (US$/Can$)(iii) 1.3428 1.2768</p><p>(i) The London Bullion Market Association's pm price in U.S. dollars.</p><p>(ii) The London Bullion Market Association's price in U.S. dollars.</p><p>(iii) Bank of Canada daily rate.</p><p>(2) Non-IFRS Measures</p><p>The Corporation has included certain performance measures in this press release that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including cash margin in dollars and in percentage. The presentation of these non-IFRS measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. As Osisko's operations are primarily focused on precious metals, the Corporation presents cash margins as it believes that certain investors use this information, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, to evaluate the Corporation's performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. However, other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently.</p><p>Cash margin (in dollars) represents revenues less cost of sales (excluding depletion).

In addition, statements and estimates (including data in tables) relating to mineral reserves and resources and gold equivalent ounces are forward-looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that the estimates will be realized. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words 'expects', 'plans', 'anticipates', 'believes', 'intends', 'estimates', 'projects', 'potential', 'scheduled' and similar expressions or variations (including negative variations), or that events or conditions 'will', 'would', 'may', 'could' or 'should' occur. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of Osisko, and actual results may accordingly differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. Such risk factors include, without limitation, (i) with respect to properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest; risks related to: (a) the operators of the properties, (b) timely development, permitting, construction, commencement of production, ramp-up (including operating and technical challenges), (c) differences in rate and timing of production from resource estimates or production forecasts by operators, (d) differences in conversion rate from resources to reserves and ability to replace resources, (e) the unfavorable outcome of any challenges or litigation relating title, permit or license, (f) hazards and uncertainty associated with the business of exploring, development and mining including, but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological and metallurgical conditions, slope failures or cave-ins, flooding and other natural disasters or civil unrest or other uninsured risks, (ii) with respect to other external factors: (a) fluctuations in the prices of the commodities that drive royalties, streams, offtakes and investments held by Osisko, (b) fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, (c) regulatory changes by national and local governments, including permitting and licensing regimes and taxation policies, regulations and political or economic developments in any of the countries where properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest are located or through which they are held, (d) continued availability of capital and financing and general economic, market or business conditions, and (e) responses of relevant governments to infectious diseases outbreaks and the effectiveness of such response and the potential impact of such outbreaks on Osisko's business, operations and financial condition; (iii) with respect to internal factors: (a) business opportunities that may or not become available to, or are pursued by Osisko, (b) the integration of acquired assets or (c) the determination of Osisko's PFIC status. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon assumptions management believes to be reasonable, including, without limitation: the absence of significant change in Osisko's ongoing income and assets relating to determination of its PFIC status, and the absence of any other factors that could cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended and, with respect to properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest, (i) the ongoing operation of the properties by the owners or operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past practice and with public disclosure (including forecast of production), (ii) the accuracy of public statements and disclosures made by the owners or operators of such underlying properties (including expectations for the development of underlying properties that are not yet in production), (iii) no adverse development in respect of any significant property, (iv) that statements and estimates relating to mineral reserves and resources by owners and operators are accurate and (v) the implementation of an adequate plan for integration of acquired assets.</p><p>For additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to the most recent Annual Information Form of Osisko filed on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url> which also provides additional general assumptions in connection with these statements.

Does the City have a handle on the problems created by homelessness?</p><p>No.</p><p>Homelessness through circumstance differs from homelessness caused by addiction.</p><p>Those sleeping in cars because they can't pay their rent differ from those suffocating under the weight of substance abuse.</p><p>What we're doing is clearly not working.</p><p>Group one must be given help navigating the minefield of existing services.</p><p>Group two, the addicted, must have ready access to treatment, followed by long-term supports.</p><p>In the meantime, I agree we need to expand the CSSI program. This program was a topic of discussion when I was on council 2011 to 2018, related to a similar program in Saskatchewan.</p><p>I supported it then, and I support a review to ensure the current program is, in fact, a good fit for Maple Ridge.</p><p>That's not what I am hearing from business and residents. I'm hearing things are continuing to escalate.</p><p>2. Do you believe residents of the City feel safe?</p><p>No. Especially seniors and those in the downtown area. I base this opinion on conversations I have had with hundreds of citizens, business owners and specifically, seniors.</p><p>Reality is much different than the perception the current council is attempting to create.</p><p>3. Do you support the City borrowing funds to build a new aquatic centre?</p><p>Yes. A qualified yes. Let's explore options. Present council nixed an opportunity favored by other cities\u2014partnering with the YMCA. I was in favor of this when I was on council (2011-2018) and this deserves a second look.</p><p>By failing to raise development and amenity fees in line with what developers pay in other cities, over the past four years, we lost an estimated $100 million in revenues that could have funded multiple aquatic centers, delivered new ice surfaces, road infrastructure and so much more. I will vote to raise fees and invite the development community to be a part of these conversations. I do not take campaign contributions from the development community and thus have no obligation to donating \"friends\" who will appear before council seeking zoning and other approvals.</p><p>4. Are you in favour of development along the Alouette River?</p><p>No. At least not along the river's floodplain.</p><p>5. Can City hall do more to attract new businesses to open in Maple Ridge?</p><p>Yes. Lack of vision has us falling far behind neighboring cities, forcing residential taxpayers to bear the brunt. Where is the plan? What's the plan? Let's dust off and revise that years-old official community plan instead of rubber-stamping piecemeal re-zoning of housing developments without establishing transportation corridors or the amenities to support them. Warning: Traffic congestion ahead!</p><p>Safer streets: Our reputation precedes us and impacts our economic development efforts.</p><p>More activity: Work to bring positive activity to the downtown on an ongoing basis to improve our appeal.</p><p>Improving traffic: Will attract business, especially in the east, toward 256 Street.</p><p>Reduce red tape: Become more accommodating and innovative. Declare: Open for business.</p><p>Review ALR and ALC: agricultural land-soil testing to confirm viable growing land. Then let's as a community discuss what will be done with lands identified as unproductive/contaminated. Promote innovative agricultural practices to encourage local farm to table production.</p><p>6. Should the City borrow funds to build a new arena facility?</p><p>Yes. However, let's explore other options first. By failing to raise development and amenity fees in line with what developers pay in other cities, over the past four years, we lost an estimated $100 million in revenues that could have delivered new ice surfaces, funded multiple aquatic centers, road infrastructure and so much more. I will vote to raise fees and invite the development community to be a part of these conversations. I do not take campaign contributions from the development community and thus have no obligation to donating \"friends\" who will appear before council seeking zoning and other approvals.</p><p>7. Should Maple Ridge take more direct action to combat the local opioid crisis?</p><p>Yes. The Federal and Provincial governments need to be held accountable for taking the lead on this conversation. City needs to concentrate on mitigating impact to local residents and businesses\u2014-and our brand. Start over. We need a Cost vs. benefit analysis of existing programs based on data from impacted citizens and business\u2014not crime stats. Eight shootings in past year; four since April. It's a matter of reality vs. perception. Citizen reality.</p><p>Step up against those who thrive by growing the street population: Salvation Army infilling empty beds with 'out of towners', prisoners dropped off after serving sentences and rehab clients who drop out of treatment and fail to return to home areas.</p><p>Realize our appeal: Huge entrenched addicted population demands high quality product, available in abundance with easy access through a vast network of dealers. Courts are too crowded to prosecute. Access to detox and treatment filled with roadblocks. And what's the point? They finish treatment and go back to the streets. Housing and supports are reserved for practicing addicts, not those who have cleaned up. Pick a problem. There's a lot that needs to be reviewed; we must start.</p><p>8. Is the City taking adequate measures to lower carbon emissions?</p><p>No. Perhaps a better question would be is the city ready to face a severe weather event? Right now, residents in Silver Valley would be cut off if a forest fire blocked their one escape route. The city must stop stalling on the bridge at 240th to provide a secondary route. Identify other critical areas that would be impacted by severe weather events. Prioritize neighborhood-specific disaster planning and build foundation for community sharing and volunteerism during disasters.</p><p>9. Are tax levels too high in the City?</p><p>Yes. Especially when taxpayers get nothing in return. I will work to deliver a reduction in taxes. I've led this before on previous councils and was successful. I'm ready to advocate for taxpayers again.</p><p>10. Should the City commit to making a decision on proposed new developments within 12 months or less?</p><p>Yes, if submissions are clear, complete and meet a professional standard; 12 months should be the maximum.</p><p>.</p><p>CLICK ON OUR ELECTIONS 2022 TAB TO FIND A WIDE VARIETY OF RELEVANT STORIES</p><p>.</p><p>EDITOR'S NOTE:</p><p>How the questions were presented to each candidate</p><p>Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows news readers have told us how much they value this important, straight-forward reference guide that helps orient them with the range of choices on the ballots \u2013 both at the council and school board levels.</p><p>Towards that end, we have attempted to make this package available (along with the following instructions) to each of the candidates in a timely fashion ahead of the Oct. 15 election.</p><p>Please read carefully before you start to fill this out.</p><p>To help voters in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows make their choices on election day, The News is asking local candidates 10 issue-based questions.</p><p>You must provide a 'yes,' a 'no,' or a 'don't know' (Y, N, D) response to EACH of these questions.</p><p>Each question MUST be answered with yes (Y), no (N), or Don't Know (D).
