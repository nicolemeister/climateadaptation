Remember all that talk about June-uary? What a difference a couple of short weeks makes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All things considered, this is just about the worst possible time for a heatwave and record-breaking temperatures.</p><p>Remember, we\u2019re coming off an extremely dry April and May, in particular. And that rainfall we had earlier in June is just a long gone drop in the bucket now.</p><p>The timing is the worst because we are only 11 days into the astronomical summer. During a normal summer, the long dry spells we experience don\u2019t start until around the middle of July.</p><p>That means water is going to be a scarce in our rivers before too long and the threat of wildfires goes off the charts.</p><p>We\u2019ve been quite fortunate the last two summers of 2020 and 2019 with balanced weather and a moderate forest fire season. That, of course, followed two dreadful summers for forest fires in this province \u2013 in fact, the worst on record in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>So what can we expect for the balance of this summer? It\u2019s highly likely the dry spell will be extensive, but hopefully not with these high temperatures we\u2019ve been experiencing.</p><p>Getting into the low 40s Celsius on Vancouver Island is just ridiculous and came completely out of the blue. The current high pressure system started a month ago in the usual places of Nevada, Arizona and California but has since spread to a large chunk of the Western United States and Canada which is scary in itself that this Heat Dome has developed to that extent.</p><p>When Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles all started registering temperatures in the low-to-mid 40s, it always raises our eyebrows, but here we are in virtually the same predicament.</p><p>It can\u2019t be emphasized enough the precautions that must be taken during this weather, even with a drop of several degrees from the peak. It can be dangerous to humans.</p><p>Humans can also be dangerous to our forests so the last thing we need is careless behaviour leading to wildfires that would spread out of control quickly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SOKENM-news20210701PSOA0001979436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SOKENM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6321-1BV1-JD2C-J4R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

What would happen if the campfire that some young people started over the weekend wasn't fully extinguished? What if smouldering coals cause a tree to ignite and the wind picks up a burning ember, dropping it on the roof of her house?</p><p>As a professor of forest ecology and fire ecology at the University of British Columbia, those aren't esoteric questions for Daniels. She knows the science and, as a person living near a forest, she knows that she can't soothe her anxieties by saying \"This will never happen to me.\"</p><p>\"I'm sitting in my backyard now,\" she says during a telephone interview on an overcast afternoon. \"I've just come out of Hunter Park which, after the rain, was quite moist so the fire danger is low. But if you had talked to me three days ago, in the middle of our little hot, dry spell, the fire danger was absolutely much higher, even here in out coastal temperate rainforest.</p><p>\"We like to think that there's not much fire danger here but, in truth, we know that in the summertime we live in a dry, hot climate. Although this year has been a little bit cooler and wet, if we look over the last five years we've had some of the biggest fire seasons in coastal regions in the last century&amp;#x26;#8230;. We are not immune.\"</p><p>Daniels is grateful for the leadership role that the District of North Vancouver is playing with its FireSmart program, as well as its implementation of FireSmart protocols in its building and renovation codes. She says the district is showing leadership by being proactive.</p><p>However, much of the responsibility for keeping homes safe &amp; - as well as protecting the lives of firefighters &amp; - falls on individual homeowners.</p><p>Her family has already done a lot to mitigate the risk of their house catching on fire and while she understands why others might be tempted to procrastinate, she wants to amplify the district's message: the risk is real.</p><p>Human nature is often reactive. When our roof leaks during a rainstorm, we remember to get it fixed. When the number of coronavirus cases climb, we remember to wear a face mask. When we see smoke, we remember that we were supposed to remove all those dead branches from our roof.</p><p>You can still hope for the best but it's better to also plan for the worst.</p><p>\"FireSmart doesn't guarantee that your home is never going to experience a fire but it sure gives you a better chance of having your house survive that fire. And, perhaps more importantly, it creates a safe space if wildland firefighters have to go into your yard and defend your home,\" Daniels says. \"One, you have a better chance that they'll save your house and, two, you're not putting their life at risk.\"</p><p>READ MORE: 85% of B.C. wildfires since April have been human-caused</p><p>South of the border and in regions where forest fires have become a more constant threat, home insurance costs have been known to triple. Sometimes you can't even get insurance if you live or build in a fire-prone area. Future fires on the North Shore could create similar pressures here. It's therefore financially more prudent to invest in some FireSmart initiatives now &amp; - it can be as simple as cutting back branches and being vigilant about clearing debris &amp; - than risk higher insurance premiums later.</p><p>Daniels says we are seeing the impact of climate change.</p><p>\"Our hot, dry summers do put us at risk,\" she says. \"From a fire ecology and fire management perspective, .125the coastal fires of.375 2015 was like turning on the light switch for all of us. Then, in 2017 there was an early fire season. We broke 85 high temperature records in one summer whether we were on Vancouver Island, the southern interior, the northern interior or on the coast. We had extreme weather conditions that exceeded anything in the instrumental records for more than 100 years.</p><p>\"And that's part of a pattern. When we look over the long term, temperatures are creeping up in the winter and summer routinely has greater droughts. This year and last year were wetter as part of our natural variation from year to year, but the overarching trend is still towards hotter and drier.\"</p><p>Imagine a rollercoaster, she says. On the West Coast's weather rollercoaster, \"the ups are getting a little bit higher and the downs aren't going as low as they usually do. So instead of the rollercoaster starting and ending at the same point, this rollercoaster starts and ends a little bit higher than it did before.\"</p><p>\"I don't think we would have talked about this in 2010,\" Daniels says. \"Now we know it's something that we need to be aware of and it's simply a shift in the way that we're understanding, experiencing and responding to wildfire.\"</p><p>So, in these waning days of summer, when the hot is not too hot to work outdoors, and the cold is not too cold to let everyone forget forest fires are a risk even on the North Shore, Daniels encourages everyone to practise a little preventative yardwork. Clean your roof, prune those trees and start imagining what might happen if a burning ember was to waft onto your property.</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

We know many areas that are willing to send us feed right now, including feed that was secured at the Port of Vancouver that was on its way to China. It looks like we may be able to reverse that and get it back into the Fraser Valley.\"</p><p>After opposition critics recounted the information gaps and problems left over from the intense forest fire season, Popham called for information from affected areas. For those who want to donate or need help, she urged people to call Emergency Management B.C. at 1-800-663-3456.</p><p>Farnworth said community leaders in the North, Interior and Vancouver Island were relieved to hear supply chains are open to those regions.</p><p>\"They wanted to know what they could do, which is to amplify the message to the private sector what government is doing, which is those supply chains are in place and that people do not need to hoard and that people are working as hard as they can to get supplies to them,\" Farnworth said.</p><p>RELATED: Crews clear vehicles from Highway 7 near Agassiz</p><p>RELATED: Coquihalla Highway will take months to repair</p><p>Fraser-Nicola MLA Jackie Tegart, who has been calling for months for a plan for displaced Lytton residents whose community burned in late June, said her region has been \"ground zero\" for disasters. Merritt has been evacuated due to flooding and every part of the region was affected by wildfires this summer, she said.</p><p>Tegart summed up the problem as \"the lack of government support and leadership, waiting for action, the need for support for local leaders, the displaced people who have moved numerous times, including those who were in Merritt during the flood and have had to move again. The desperate requests for planning and for information-sharing and transparency.\"</p><p>Farnworth said Tegart has raised important points, and reiterated that B.C. expects to have the national Alert Ready phone text warning system functioning by next spring.</p><p>\"But most importantly, the fundamental way in which we deal with emergencies in this province does have to change,\" Farnworth said. \"That's why we're doing this significant rewrite of the Emergency Program Act so that we are able to deal with these significantly better.\"</p><p>@tomfletcherbc <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tfletcher@blackpress.caLike\">tfletcher@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-4244347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6447-S111-JDH1-C3KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Group Ltd. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abbotsford News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 19, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

Merritt has been evacuated due to flooding and every part of the region was affected by wildfires this summer, she said.</p><p>Tegart summed up the problem as \"the lack of government support and leadership, waiting for action, the need for support for local leaders, the displaced people who have moved numerous times, including those who were in Merritt during the flood and have had to move again. The desperate requests for planning and for information-sharing and transparency.\"</p><p>Farnworth said Tegart has raised important points, and reiterated that B.C. expects to have the national Alert Ready phone text warning system functioning by next spring.</p><p>\"But most importantly, the fundamental way in which we deal with emergencies in this province does have to change,\" Farnworth said. \"That's why we're doing this significant rewrite of the Emergency Program Act so that we are able to deal with these significantly better.\"</p><p>@tomfletcherbc</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tfletcher@blackpress.ca\">tfletcher@blackpress.ca</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on</p><p>\"<url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/BlackPressMedia\">http://twitter.com/BlackPressMedia</url>\" Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20211119PAB4244347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6445-31H1-JD2C-J3M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>As of Friday, March 31, 16 speed cameras were active, according to the city.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March 31, 16 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

So, we\u2019ll put up wood frame and plastic tents for processes like curing that we need to keep separated.\u201d </p><p>McFarlane makes soap and laundry powder for individual and retailer customers \u2013 including 86 Sobeys stores \u2013 across the Maritimes.  </p><p>Atlantic Gold\u2019s communications manager Dustin O\u2019Leary would not comment on the specific financial or lease arrangements. But, he said, \u201cHere\u2019s a local business who had a horrible situation happened to them and needed some help, and this is a space [the fire hall] where a commercial business could happen.

The flight was traveling from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast, it added.</p><p>Villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down, sparking a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \"all-out effort\" by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety.</p><p>State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern's fleet were ordered grounded, while broadcaster CCTV said the airliner had set up nine teams to deal with aircraft disposal, accident investigation, family assistance and other pressing matters.</p><p>The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.</p><p>State media said local police first received calls from villagers alerting the crash around 2:30 p.m. (0630 GMT). Guangxi provincial emergency management department said contact with the plane was lost at 2:15 p.m. (0615 GMT).</p><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was aware of the initial reports of the crash and was \"working to gather more information.\" Boeing stock dropped over 8% in pre-market trading early Monday.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country's top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>China Eastern's flight No. 5735 had been traveling at around 30,000 feet when suddenly, just after 2:20 p.m., the plane entered a deep dive at its cruising altitude speed of 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph), according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The data suggests the plane crashed within a minute and a half of whatever went wrong.</p><p>The plane stopped transmitting data just southwest of Wuzhou, a city of 3 million in eastern Guangxi.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years. China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as one of the main workhorses of its fleet \u2014 of its over 600 planes, 109 are Boeing 737-800s.</p><p>China Eastern online made its website have a black-and-white homepage after the crash.</p><p>The accident quickly became a leading topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, with 1.34 billion views and 690,000 discussions. Many posts expressed condolences to the families of victims, while others questioned the planes' safety.</p><p>Boeing began delivering the 737-800 to customers in 1997 and delivered the last of the series to China Eastern in 2020. It made over 5,200 of the narrow-body aircraft, a popular, single-aisle commuter plane.</p><p>The twin-engine, single aisle Boeing 737 is one of the world's most popular planes for short and medium-haul flights. China Eastern operates multiple versions of the common aircraft, including the 737-800 and the 737 Max.</p><p>The deadliest crash involving a Boeing 737-800 came in January 2020, when Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard accidentally shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight, killing all 176 people on board.</p><p>The 737 Max version was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes. China's aviation regulator cleared that plane to return to service late last year, making the country the last major market to do so.</p><p>China's last deadly crash of a civilian jetliner was in August 2010.</p><p>\u2014Ken Moritsugu, The Associated Press</p><p>RELATED: Stormy, cloudy conditions the day of fatal Alberta plane crash: report</p><p>Copyright 2022 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20220321PAB4297229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6523-9RS1-F0HF-829P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Group Ltd.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Wednesday, March 15, 21 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>As of Wednesday, March 15, 21 speed cameras were active, according to the city.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.</p><p>As of Tuesday, March 14, all 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

But another fire that started early Thursday and swept through the district of Akseki, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north, kept firefighters engaged. </p><p>Three people were killed in the fires, and authorities evacuated nearly 20 neighborhoods or villages.</p><p>Meanwhile, another forest fire broke out near the town of Armutalan, close to the resort of Marmaris, 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Antalya, threatening a coastal residential area that includes hotels. The state-run Anadolu Agency said some people were being evacuated from the area as a precaution. Pakdemirli said a firefighting plane and five helicopters were involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control.</p><p>The dead in the fires in Antalya included a 82-year-old man in Akseki\u2019s Kepezbeleni neighborhood, where 80% of the houses were incinerated, the district\u2019s governor, Volkan Hulur, told Anadolu. </p><p>The Turkish government's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said in addition to the three dead, at least 112 people were affected by the fires, including 58 who were hospitalized, mostly for smoke inhalation. </p><p>Authorities also rescued 10 people who were stranded at a restaurant by a dam near Akseki.</p><p>AFAD said several homes, businesses, crops and vehicles were damaged in Manavgat but did not elaborate.</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, there is no immediate threat to any settlement or to life, but in the hours to come, if the wind changes direction, we will need to take additional precautions,\u201d Pakdemirli, the forest minister, told reporters in Manavgat. </p><p>He said 10 intubated intensive care patients at Manavgat's state hospital were transferred to other hospitals as a precaution. </p><p>The Antalya region is a popular vacation destination for tourists from Russia and other parts of Europe, but none of the holiday resorts were affected by the fires, officials said.</p><p>Firefighters were also tackling wildfires in other parts of Turkey, including one that temporarily closed a highway between the southern Turkish cities of Mersin and Antalya, Anadolu reported.</p><p>Wildfires are common in Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean and Aegean regions during the arid summer months, although some previous forest fires have been blamed on arson.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-221b65f565f878f8e547b980dc72759a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637X-FVH1-JBVR-3020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><timeReceived>08:29 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 29, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, March 14, all 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Monday, March 27, 19 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Areas where infrastructure once stood were \u201ccompletely burned to ash, right to the ground,\u201d he said. </p><p>When the wildfire first threatened the research station in September, fire crews removed vegetation near buildings and set up sprinklers to soak the area in an attempt to protect the facility.  </p><p>These measures fell short, according to LKFN.  </p><p>\u201cENR failed to attack the fire even though it was close to the site,\" the First Nation wrote, referring to the territorial Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which oversees wildfire response in the N.W.T.  </p><p>\"Weeks ago, it removed a sprinkler protection system, fearing it might be damaged by pending frost, while knowing the fire was active.\" </p><p>Mike Westwick, an N.W.T. government wildfire information officer, said by email that \u201cfighting fires isn't as simple as turning on a hose and spraying. There are so many challenges in between \u2013 the most important of which is protecting human life.\" </p><p>He wrote: \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that with the extreme winds we\u2019ve seen in the area, it was simply unsafe to attack the fire directly.\" </p><p>According to Westwick, sprinklers were pulled off the site last Thursday. Westwick said that action was taken not because of potential frost damage, but because the equipment froze, rendering it ineffective.  </p><p>\u201cThis is simply a sign of the extraordinary season we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen we\u2019re fighting fires and protecting structures, it is highly unusual for there to be the threat of freezing temperatures.\u201d </p><p>Cazon, too, acknowledged that conditions this year have been \u201cunprecedented.\u201d He said he hopes ENR will be more prepared for extreme weather events in future.   </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having 30-degree weather in May. There\u2019s no snow on the ground in mid-October, never mind how dry this fall has been,\" said Cazon. \"You have to adapt to the ongoing evolution of climate change and how it\u2019s affecting everybody around us. This is the reality we have to start facing.\u201d  </p><p>After the equipment was removed, Westwick said, extreme winds caused the fire to spread. </p><p>\u201cWe really do feel for everyone affected by the losses at Scotty Creek,\u201c he wrote. \u201cThe setback is going to hurt and its importance is not lost on us.\u201d </p><p>The damage comes after a historic year in which Scotty Creek become a fully Indigenous-led research station, embracing a collaborative partnership with Wilfrid Laurier University. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kind-of lost for words,\u201d said Ashley Menicoche, regional coordinator for the Dehcho's Ed\u00e9hzh\u00ede protected area. \u201cI actually have one of my guardians, William Alger, out there today assisting with gathering up the materials that burnt.\u201d  </p><p>Menicoche says Alger helped to build a strong working relationship between Ed\u00e9hzh\u00ede and Scotty Creek, two of the most influential Indigenous-led organizations in the Dehcho. Both are developing a national reputation as models for Indigenous sovereignty. </p><p>\u201cHe was so proud,\u201d said Menicoche. \u201cFor him to hear this news... I know it didn\u2019t only affect him, it affected so many. It will be a ripple effect.\u201d </p><p>For the nearby community of Fort Simpson, the loss will also be financial. </p><p>The research station made the area a thoroughfare for national and international visitors and had become a centre for community engagement and education.  </p><p>\u201cOur hotels, bed and breakfasts, charter airlines will take the biggest hit,\u201d said Chief Kele Antoine of the \u0141\u0131\u0301\u0131\u0301dl\u0131\u0328\u0131\u0328 K\u0173\u0301\u0119\u0301 First Nation.  </p><p>\u201cImportant climate change research, youth education, and the economic activities that are part of keeping it going will now be temporarily halted.\u201d </p><p>In April, LKFN was working on compiling all data from the area into a compendium of knowledge for future generations. While the future of research at Scotty Creek is still unclear, Cazon says work from the past year \u2013 and the rest of the information gathered over the years \u2013 is secure.  </p><p>\u201cMost field data would have been collected and secured on servers, and the other data would have already been archived,\u201d said Cazon.  </p><p>\u201cAlger and staff at Scotty Creek had gone into the field to shut down the camp and download all the data. They had gathered everything from this past season\u2019s work, and they had the area shut down for freeze-up.\u201d </p><p>The impact of the damage will also be felt in the research community.  </p><p>Scotty Creek has been in place since the 1990s. It also happens to be situated near the southern edge of permafrost, Scotty Creek director Bill Quinton told Cabin Radio last month, when the fire first threatened. (Quinton was not available for comment before publication of this latest report.) </p><p>Quinton said the station was put in at a time when a lot of environmental changes were noted due to climate warming. Over the past quarter of a century, researchers have collected an invaluable data archive, he said.  </p><p>Although it\u2019s still unclear how monitoring equipment in the area has fared, the known damage is \u201cgoing to be a hit,\u201d Cazon said. </p><p>Data collected at Scotty Creek is shared globally. Researchers from at least six Canadian universities and institutions in the United States and Europe will be directly affected, LKFN reported. </p><p>The value of the losses is still being assessed, according to LKFN, but will be substantial. Last month, Quinton said the fire threatened equipment, infrastructure and research investments worth millions of dollars. </p><p>Two members of Scotty Creek\u2019s team are currently assessing the damage, taking stock of what survived and what is salvageable, Cazon said, adding the First Nation will have to work out how to bounce back. </p><p>LKFN expects the research station to be closed for an extended period of time. </p><p>Menicoche, the Ed\u00e9hzh\u00ede coordinator, became emotional discussing the impact on the First Nation and beyond \u2013 but couldn't help a wry smile at the irony.  </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unfortunate that it was a climate change research centre that burnt\u2026 and it was climate change that took it and burned it,\u201d Menicoche said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-23d17e311ac34333928c41fd27abc5ad</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66NF-75T1-JBVR-315F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1186\"/><timeReceived>10:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 19, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(CREST) is the primary provider for communication tools, from radios to cell towers, for 50 first responder agencies across the CRD.</p><p>The \u201cvery specialized\u201d equipment required to monitor and repair their infrastructure is currently housed in a modest Langford warehouse, said CREST general manager Gord Horth. That equipment includes a reserve of satellite radios and the software to remotely monitor more than 30 P25 transmission towers, which were installed across the region last year to fully lift CREST\u2019s clients to digital over analog communication.</p><p>In the fall strategic plan, the potential loss of specialized equipment and personnel housed in Langford was identified as their greatest risk, Horth said. Engineering firm Stantec conducted an independent review confirming as much. As a result, a task force of CREST board members has been created to look at options for a post-seismic facility.</p><p>One option is sharing space within an emer-gency service building, such as either of the new fire halls being built in Esquimalt and Victoria, or the slated expansion for the West Shore RCMP headquarters. Another is raising a new purpose-built facility to \u201cmeet our projected and future needs,\u201d Horth said.</p><p>Either option will suit after considering price and location, he added.</p><p>The special nature of CREST\u2019s equipment and the likelihood of natural disasters spell the company\u2019s need for a protected facility. Two years ago, the telecoms company operationally recovered from a facility flood in two days, thanks to spare equipment which would otherwise take three to six months to order and replace.</p><p>\u201cA number of components come from Japan \u2026 our microwave spares come from Israel,\u201d Horth said. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty diverse supply chain on emergency equipment throughout the world. When you\u2019re in a remote area like Vancouver Island, it\u2019s really prudent to have spare (equipment) here instead of a warehouse in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Given that a natural disaster \u201cwill happen at some point\u201d considering forest fire and seismic patterns, Horth said, an investment in a protected facility is a \u201cprudent move so that we can be self-reliant.\u201d</p><p>News Staff</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLDNWS-news20210609PQGA0001924405</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLDNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62WH-M161-F0HF-81HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438289</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"397\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Wednesday, March 22, 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

That equipment includes a reserve of satellite radios and the software to remotely monitor more than 30 P25 transmission towers, which were installed across the re-gion last year to fully lift CREST\u2019s clients to digital over analog communication.</p><p>In the fall strategic plan, the potential loss of specialized equipment and personnel housed in Langford was identified as their greatest risk, Horth said. Engineering firm Stantec conducted an independent review confirming as much. As a result, a task force of CREST board members has been created to look at options for a post-seismic facility.</p><p>One option is sharing space within an emergency service building, such as either of the new fire halls being built in Esquimalt and Victoria, or the slated expansion for the West Shore RCMP headquarters. Another is raising a new purpose-built facility to \u201cmeet our projected and future needs,\u201d Horth said.</p><p>Either option will suit after considering price and location, he added.</p><p>The special nature of CREST\u2019s equipment and the likelihood of natural disasters spell the company\u2019s need for a protected facility. Two years ago, the telecoms company operationally recovered from a facility flood in two days, thanks to spare equipment which would otherwise take three to six months to order and replace.</p><p>\u201cA number of components come from Japan \u2026 our microwave spares come from Israel,\u201d Horth said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty diverse supply chain on emergency equipment throughout the world. When you\u2019re in a remote area like Vancouver Island, it\u2019s really prudent to have spare (equipment) here instead of a warehouse in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Given that a natural disaster \u201cwill happen at some point\u201d considering forest fire and seismic patterns, Horth said, an investment in a protected facility is a \u201cprudent move so that we can be self-reliant.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SOKENM-news20210610PSOA0001928093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SOKENM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62WN-93D1-JD2C-J2NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>As of Wednesday, March 22, 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

There\u2019s always a push to better ourselves.\u201d </p><p>The three departments are not in the mainstream RDCK fire protection service, as the communities don\u2019t have the tax base or infrastructure to support the insurance industry standards required for professional fire departments.  </p><p>Peterson said that caused some friction during the summer fire season, when fires blew up south of Fauquier and Edgewood, and the volunteers stayed behind to protect their homes. </p><p>\u201cThey were kind of spurned at first by the provincial people, because they weren\u2019t trained. They felt kind of left out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end, the fire department helped set up sprinklers and all kinds of different things. But at the beginning it was kind of hands-off.\u201d </p><p>More training will help them be recognized as effective support in such an emergency, says Peterson. </p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t go out into the middle of the woods after the training,\u201d says Peterson. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a problem in their jurisdiction, they\u2019ll be able to handle it when it happens.\u201d </p><p>Peterson said it\u2019s not certain what the final amount would be to hire the trainer. That will be determined when the chiefs pick courses for their crews and the logistics are worked out. But he said he\u2019s willing to spend $10,000 or more if that\u2019s what it will take to support local firefighting efforts in summers like this. </p><p>\u201cWhatever it takes, is available,\u201d he promised. \u201cWhatever is good for each fire department is good for that community.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s no word on when the training will begin, but it won\u2019t likely be until later in the fall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5c41091e964640c9b41eed8e2543e69d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63G3-JBB1-JBVR-31NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"415\"/><timeReceived>00:23 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 27, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNKD</classCode><className>SELF IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097YK</classCode><className>RECRUITMENT &amp; HIRING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>N524000CC</classCode><className>INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000A2VZ</classCode></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

However, as stated in the release, wildfire smoke can be harmful to the health of all individuals, even at low concentrations.</p><p><br/><br/> That applies to the health of our skin, too. As dermatologist Dr. Julia Carroll of Toronto's Compass Dermatology explains, \"smoke has lots of harmful particles in it and chemicals that can irritate the skin.\" <br/><br/> Because of this, some people, especially those with sensitive skin or skin allergies, might experience redness, itching or dryness. The particles in the air could also trigger existing conditions like eczema or rosacea. Furthermore, people prone to acne might notice breakout flare-ups as the pollutants can clog the pores and cause inflammation.<br/><br/> Those are the short-term effects, but over time, air pollution can also accelerate skin aging because of prolonged exposure to toxins and free radicals.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read the full story:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/fashion_style/beauty/2023/06/07/poor-air-quality-is-bad-for-your-skin-too-heres-how-to-protect-yourself.html\">Poor air quality is bad for your skin, too.

The smoke plumes have led to dramatic drops in air quality, which, according to Environment Canada, will likely persist through the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agency warned that those with respiratory issues like asthma, people with heart disease, older folks, children, pregnant people and those working outside are at higher risk of experiencing health effects. However, as stated in the release, wildfire smoke can be harmful to the health of all individuals, even at low concentrations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That applies to the health of our skin, too. As dermatologist Dr. Julia Carroll of Toronto's Compass Dermatology explains, \"smoke has lots of harmful particles in it and chemicals that can irritate the skin.\"</p><p>Because of this, some people, especially those with sensitive skin or skin allergies, might experience redness, itching or dryness. The particles in the air could also trigger existing conditions like eczema or rosacea. Furthermore, people prone to acne might notice breakout flare-ups as the pollutants can clog the pores and cause inflammation.</p><p>Those are the short-term effects, but over time, air pollution can also accelerate skin aging because of prolonged exposure to toxins and free radicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read the full story:</emphasis> Poor air quality is bad for your skin, too.

Evia is northeast of the capital Athens. <br/> The civil protection authorities had announced on Sunday a 'very high risk' of fire for many areas of Greece on Monday. <br/> Wildfires since July have ravaged the islands of Evia and Rhodes as well as forests to the north and southeast of Athens, and parts of the Peloponnese peninsula. Three people have died as a result of the fires. <br/> The government has blamed the disaster on the worst heatwave the country has seen in decades. <br/> Climate scientists warn extreme weather and fierce fires will become increasingly common due to man-made global warming, heightening the need to invest in teams, equipment and policy to battle the flames.  <br/><url

The floods and landslides caused by last November's atmospheric river in B.C. Sea level rise. Thawing permafrost. Heat domes and resulting out-of-control forest fires. Drought and famine.</p><p>The only thing the IPCC got wrong was how soon this would all start to happen. In the past year alone, we've experienced every one of these disasters, around the world and close to home. The science tells us these extreme weather events will continue to grow in intensity and frequency. Meanwhile, emissions continue to rise. But what can we do about it here in Maple Ridge?</p><p>Shortly after the IPCC report came out, we held our last municipal election. I expected climate change to be the focus of every candidate's platform, but I was wrong. Not a single question was asked about how the candidates planned to address the crisis. And in the intervening four years, while our neighbour cities drafted bold action plans and got to work getting cars off roads and finding cleaner ways to heat and cool their buildings, we have sat on our hands and looked the other way.</p><p>Sure our Official Community Plan has been updated with targets to reduce emissions in line with the IPCC report. But there is no plan to meet the targets. Words on a page, with no plan to achieve the goals, are meaningless.</p><p>So this year, at the all-candidates forum on Sept. 26, I was incredibly cheered that the first question asked of each candidate for Maple Ridge's new mayor and council was: \"What will you do to reduce carbon emissions?\" And some of them even had pretty good answers!</p><p>Metro Vancouver tells us where the majority of emissions are coming from across the region. The two main culprits are transportation and buildings. Just over 30 per cent of our carbon pollution comes from gas-burning cars and trucks; a quarter of it comes from buildings, which in Maple Ridge mostly means homes.</p><p>Many B.C. cities are taking action to fight these sources of carbon pollution, and we have much to learn from their excellent solutions.</p><p>Let's begin with housing. Starting on Oct. 16 (the day after this year's municipal election), all new single-family homes should be built with clean heating systems such as electric heat pumps, which have the added advantage of cooling our homes during our increasingly hot summers.</p><p>For existing homes, the provincial and federal governments give substantial rebates to homeowners who install electric heat pumps, and Maple Ridge can top that up with further incentives, following the lead of North Vancouver, Saanich, and many other communities.</p><p>Won't switching from fracked gas to electric heat pumps strain our electrical system? This is a valid concern, which is why the city also needs to get on board with implementing the province's BC Energy Step Code. The Step Code, created in collaboration with builders and developers, is designed to reduce emissions from new construction, and create buildings that use less energy to heat and cool. By using less energy, we reduce the demand on BC's water-powered clean electricity system.</p><p>Maple Ridge is lagging behind many cities in adopting the Step Code. But one of the important early steps \u2013 to consult with the local development community \u2013 has already been taken. This puts us in a position to launch the lower levels of the Step Code right away.</p><p>As for emissions from gas-powered cars and trucks, here we have another great opportunity. The city is in the final stages of refreshing its Strategic Transportation Plan (STP). The draft STP identifies high priority enhancements to pedestrian, cycling and e-mobility infrastructure. The STP reports make it clear that the lack of good quality facilities is getting in the way of residents' ability and willingness to get out of their cars. The current network is inconvenient and unsafe for walking and cycling.</p><p>The STP is intended to guide the city's transportation investments over the next 30 years. But we simply don't have 30 years to turn this ship around. We must accelerate implementation of the STP's recommendations for cycling, pedestrian and e-mobility facilities, such as safe, separated bike lanes, and sidewalks throughout the city.</p><p>To do this, we need to set clear and specific goals for reducing trips taken by cars and trucks. For example, Port Moody has set a goal for 40 per cent of trips to be taken by walking, cycling or transit by 2030 - an increase of 23 per cent over today's numbers.</p><p>READ ALSO: Extreme weather proves destructive</p><p>Notice that Port Moody's goal is not to replace gas-powered vehicles with electric vehicles and call it a day. As our population grows, we also need to re-think the way we plan our cities and move around in order to forestall even worse traffic congestion than we already have. Building more and bigger roads is certainly not the answer. That's like trying to lose weight by getting bigger pants.</p><p>Still, cars will continue to be valuable methods of transportation, though the form of ownership will change over time. So as we continue to densify our city, buildings must be equipped with charging infrastructure (we're talking about charger-ready wiring here, not the sometime-in-the-future, if-the-strata-agrees, at-a-cost-to-all-residents theoretical charging capacity guidelines that we have now) to accommodate the quick switch to electric vehicles. Equally importantly, buildings must have sufficient secure long-term parking for bicycles, and ample short-term bike parking.</p><p>Of course there are many other steps that the city can and should take to reduce emissions and adapt to a climate that is already changing. We need to evaluate, protect and expand the services provided to the city by \"green infrastructure.\" This includes wetlands, streams and riparian areas that can moderate the effects of intense rain events. Similarly, a more generous tree canopy will suck more carbon out of the air and pull more water out of the ground, while shading us on the critically hot days we now experience as the \"new normal.\"</p><p>These are the commitments we should be looking for from today's candidates for city council. We need an \"all hands on deck\" approach, with a plan that involves every department in the city, from finance, planning and engineering, to parks, economic development and community engagement.</p><p>So when candidates for mayor and council show up on your doorstep, or if you're checking out their websites or going to a debate, here are the three most important questions to consider. Do they understand the causes of climate change? Do they agree that action is urgently needed? And that elegant, all-encompassing question from the first all-candidates forum: Exactly what will they do to lower carbon emissions in Maple Ridge?</p><p>If they don't give you this list or something pretty close to it, they're just blowing forest-fire smoke.</p><p>\u2013 Kirk Grayson is a digital strategy consultant and board president of the Maple Ridge Climate Hub.</p><p>READ ALSO: B.C. signs new climate agreement with California, Oregon and Washington</p><p>Have a story tip?

This is an outrage!</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I want my candy sultry, permissive and in high heels!</emphasis><br/><br/> In fairness, the outrage in conservative media this week came from a more astonishing event. On Monday, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, the gaudy Palm Beach residence of former U.S. president Donald J. Trump. This was an orderly seizure of government documents that should've never been taken to Mar-a-Lago in the first place.</p><p><br/><br/> But when Trump reluctantly left the White House, he acted like a drunken hotel guest who swipes the lamps before checkout. He took whatever he wanted, allegedly including classified material so sensitive, the contents can't be publicly described. This must be a bumper year for Mar-a-Lago club membership from Chinese, Russian and Iranian nationals who might be hankering for more than a caviar brunch by the pool.<br/><br/> This is not complicated. Trump took government documents that belong in the National Archives. Those documents could pose a threat to national security, something Republicans once cared about. The FBI had every right to reclaim this property. If the police recover your stolen bike, that doesn't mean they've infringed upon the human rights of the thief. <br/><br/> But Trump always commits the crime and pretends to be the victim.<br/><br/> And the suckers who idolize him always fall for it.<br/><br/> On Monday, he said \"these are dark times for our Nation.\" He said his home was \"under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.\"<br/><br/> \"They even broke into my safe!\" he whined.<br/><br/> You can almost picture baffled agents standing around as the safe door was cracked open: \"What the hell? This thing is full of Big Macs!\"<br/><br/> Tellingly, Mr. Trump did not share an affidavit, search warrant or any official papers his legal team would've received. As MSNBC's Joe Scarborough noted on Wednesday: \"Donald Trump can release the warrant ... If it's such a scam, Donald - hey, Donald, I know you watch - if it's such a scam, listen to me, release the warrant.\"<br/><br/> Joe, there's a better chance Cardi B will join a nunnery.<br/><br/> Trump will not release the warrant because he doesn't want his braindead followers to ever be in the same postal code as reality. It's more politically advantageous to cry \"witch hunt,\" to claim he is being persecuted by partisan mercenaries who do bong hits with Hunter Biden.<br/><br/> It's the same reason that on Wednesday, during a deposition with the New York Attorney General as part of an ongoing investigation into his dubious business dealings, Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2022/08/10/trump-says-hes-testifying-wednesday-in-new-york-civil-investigation.html?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=thestar_world\">exercised his Fifth Amendment</url> rights.<br/><br/> This after previously saying only criminals and mobsters plead the fifth.<br/><br/> Since the FBI does not comment on active investigations, we don't know what led to Monday's unprecedented move. But a search warrant requires a federal judge to sign off on probable cause. Whatever the FBI was searching for, it wasn't Pok\u00e9mon. The Department of Justice knew this would trigger a political firestorm. They did it anyway because they had no choice.<br/><br/> Alas, instead of waiting for the facts, right wing media seized upon the seizure at Mar-a-Lago as an opportunity to score cheap political points and rouse the rabble. Republicans, once the party of law and order, called for the FBI to be defunded or disbanded. Comparisons were made to banana republics. GOP hacks vowed revenge on Joe Biden for \"weaponizing\" law enforcement, even though he was never told about this \"raid\" in advance.<br/><br/> By Wednesday, the incoherent talking points on Fox News and elsewhere inside the radical right ecosystem had turned into a forest fire of disinformation: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The FBI had \"planted\" evidence! They stormed Trump's golden palace because he had proof there is a global cabal of Satanist pedophiles! Those FBI perverts just wanted to leer at Melania's lingerie! They stole Barron's science project! They killed Kenny!</emphasis><br/><br/> Steve Bannon, MAGA's grifter-in-chief, suggested the Deep State might be planning to assassinate Trump. This bonkers rhetoric would be grimly amusing if it wasn't so dangerous.<br/><br/> Researchers who track Trumpian social media have detected a spike this week in references to \"civil war\" and \"locked and loaded.\" Although we don't know exactly why the FBI acted, the MAGA cult is convinced it has the answer: the federal government is evil and it's time to take up arms against Dear Leader's oppressors and overthrow this illegitimate regime.<br/><br/> This is the everlasting shame of so many in conservative media.<br/><br/> They know government documents, especially classified material, should not be at Mar-a-Lago - they wanted to lock up Hillary Clinton over her emails. They know Trump routinely flouts norms and laws. They know he's a narcissistic sociopath. They know his fans are lunatics. They know America is a divided, flint-and-steel tinderbox. But instead of waiting for the facts, they lit a match by acting like the FBI took a battering ram to the doors and, with guns blazing, violated Trump's rights while looting Mar-a-Lago for kicks.<br/><br/> Nothing could be further from the truth.<br/><br/> But for the right wing punditry, as we saw this week, the truth is an inconvenience. You can't rack up clicks, ratings and profits by telling your already enraged audience the FBI acted entirely appropriately.<br/><br/> It's better to lie through your teeth and risk civil war.<br/><br/> Vinay Menon is the Star's pop culture columnist based in Toronto.

The Yukon crew flew to Kamloops in a C-131 military aircraft with the Royal Canadian Airforce on Aug. 16. They are on a 19-day deployment, with 14 days active on the fire line. The fighters were deployed to the Garrison Lake and Mount Law fires after a provincial briefing in Kamloops. The Garrison Lake fire is a 14,000-hectare blaze burning southwest of Princeton, B.C. About 200 properties in the area were evacuated on Aug. 15. The 200-hectare Mount Law fire near West Kelowna is burning around 800 hectares, with 460 properties now evacuated. According to Thomas, Yukon\u2019s firefighters are prepared for the chaotic scene that awaits them. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those types of things where \u2026 you get excited, because you\u2019re getting to use your skills that you trained for,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of adrenaline going, there\u2019s a lot of excitement.\u201d Yukon\u2019s firefighters are part of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre network, which means crews are available to help at the request of neighbouring provinces or territories. Since the Yukon has a shorter fire season, this trip is a good opportunity to continue working, Thomas continued. \u201cI know from my experience, this is one of the better times you could be a part of, because we have such a short season here in the territory, so when you get to go down south and get more tools for the toolbox, and broaden your horizons a bit, it\u2019s great for our folks,\u201d Thomas said. Thomas explained that the regular season for Yukon First Nations Wildfire usually ends on Aug. 13. Its regular seasonal contract with the Yukon government was extended in case B.C. requested help or local flooding worsened. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of them \u2013 it was a great thing to see them sent off,\u201d Thomas said. The Okanagan area has been on alert for several weeks as raging fires burn approximately 805,500 total hectares of land. There are 260 active fires as of Aug. 17, with 3,600 personnel battling them. Approximately 500 of those fighters travelled to B.C. from outside the province. \u2013 With files from the Summerland Review and Kelowna Capital News Contact Gabrielle Plonka at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gabrielle.plonka@yukon-news.com\">gabrielle.plonka@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>News Reporter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20210818PTEA0002067123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DC-83J1-F0HF-81HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The site would be utilized exclusively by the group to dispose of trees, branches, leaves, and debris from yard cleanup. </p><p>PRRD director and Dawson Creek Mayor Dale Bumstead excused himself from the discussion at the board\u2019s Nov. 18 meeting, as he penned the Oct. 21 letter requesting for a licence of occupation for the site as a member.  </p><p>Electoral Area D Director Leonard Hiebert says he\u2019s had conversations with members of the association, noting the group has approached Louisiana Pacific, who would handle debris disposal through controlled burns. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be controlled. They don\u2019t have a place to put it when they clean out their yards, and so this is something that will be controlled, it can then be put in one specific spot, it can be monitored that way. Whereas before it can be thrown anywhere or taken away from where it currently is,\" he said adding it would take fuel away from any potential fire situation, and has the benefit of being contained in one location.   </p><p>PRRD chair Brad Sperling says approving the site is not really in the best interests of the PRRD, citing liability as the chief concern. </p><p>\u201cI have some concerns over the liability aspect to the regional district, because we are ultimately if there\u2019s a fire or waste was dumped there and not cleaned up,\u201d said Sperling. \u201cIt says the association will do the monitoring and that, but for whatever reason if it wasn\u2019t monitored or something was to go wrong, that liability falls to the regional district.\u201d </p><p>He added it doesn\u2019t matter whether a forest fire, a regular fire, or carcasses dumped at the site, the move sets precedence for approving more sites. </p><p>\u201cWe do this one, how many other ones are we going to start doing? We have little communities and associations everywhere. I understand, but it\u2019s a slippery slope where I can see.\" </p><p>Electoral Area E Director Dan Rose says the One Island Lake community has already been recognized as a FireSmart neighbourhood, referring to a FireSmart Canada approval letter attached to the association\u2019s request. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a program that we pushed, and they\u2019ve taken advantage of it. A big part of that program is cleaning up lots and having a place to put that stuff, and it seems a little but odd that we wouldn\u2019t support a place to put that stuff,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to get everybody to do. And they\u2019ve demonstrated that it can work and they\u2019ve been recognized for it, so I think we want to support it.\u201d </p><p>Taylor Mayor Rob Fraser says the request is only the first step, with an agreement to be put in place with the regional district. </p><p>\u201cTo me, I think our staff will do a good job of pulling together an agreement with those folks that they\u2019ll look after it properly, so I\u2019m in favour,\u201d he said. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tsummer@ahnfsj.ca\">tsummer@ahnfsj.ca</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5ea105cf6d784218a0efa0c13bd7023f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:644W-6N41-DY9S-T4WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><timeReceived>11:56 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 21, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Wednesday, March 1, 21 of 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational in April 2022.</p><p>As of Wednesday, March 1, 21 of 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

It quickly became a popular spot for hikers and families as well as people looking for a spot to relax and meditate.</p><p>Swings were added and many found it to be a peaceful rest stop.</p><p>Bird said guest books placed in the lodge were filled with heartfelt thank you notes from hundreds of people.</p><p>\"The amount of wonderful people I've run across there are just amazing, people of all ages.\"</p><p>Everything went well until about six weeks ago.</p><p>\"This one group of rowdies discovered it... and ever since then there's been problems. They've had fires, they leave garbage behind, they're destructive,\"said Bird. \"I met them one time; they were belligerent.\"</p><p>As a result of the behaviour, there was a complaint to the city, which told Bird the lodge was to be dismantled on May 20.</p><p>He's sad to hear the news but understands the reasoning behind it.</p><p>\"I see the danger of forest fire especially as the undergrowth starts to dry out; I can't argue with that,\"said Bird. \"If it wasn't for these idiots it wouldn't be a concern, but all it takes is one.\"</p><p>Still, some members of a Facebook group dedicated to the spot were hoping to save the lodge and launched a petition. In response to correspondence from group members, the city's bylaw department pointed to violations relating to drinking in parks as well as bylaws against putting up structures in parks.</p><p>Bird said he doesn't plan to rebuild it elsewhere.</p><p>\"It would be hard to duplicate that location, with the sound of the brook and the trout swimming up, I don't think it can be reproduced.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rszekely@durhamregion.com\">rszekely@durhamregion.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210527IOTA0001881710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62SF-R841-JDV5-F0CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Schools that need to be replaced, new schools that need to be built and our seismic upgrade program,\" Robinson said.</p><p>\"Our funding in this budget reflects our continued effort to recognize those needs.\"</p><p>Robinson made the comments during an exclusive 45-minute roundtable media session on the budget with Black Press Media reporters on Wednesday.</p><p>Central Okanagan Public Schools is anxiously awaiting a funding announcement for a new secondary school in West Kelowna, which was approved in principle by the Ministry of Education last spring, while the desire to replace the aging Rutland Middle School has also been a top capital priority for the last two decades.</p><p>Robinson maintained capital spending for education remains a challenge as school districts attempt to anticipate decreases and increases in student enrolment.</p><p>\"In the last five or six years we have seen growth in student enrolment in our schools and we work quickly as we can to budget for that but you can well appreciate it takes five or six years to identify where the greatest need is for a new school and then to plan and build it,\" she said.</p><p>Asked if the government could create funding to access in advance of enrolment changes rather than reacting after the fact, Robinson replied: \"It was not that long ago we were seeing decreases in enrolment\u2026but trying to anticipate enrolment changes is always I think going to be a challenge.\"</p><p>In other issues addressed during the Black Press media roundtable, Robinson cited the province's commitment to invest $164 million in complex care housing and related supports for those facing mental health and addiction challenges.</p><p>Four such complexes already exist in the Lower Mainland, and Robinson said the rollout and location on the projected 20 new sites forecast will be led by Mental Health and Addictions Minister Sheila Malcolmson.</p><p>Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran, speaking on behalf of the BC Urban Mayors group, applauded the funding with the hope of learning more soon about where those sites will be located, the services to be made available at each site and how quickly those sites will be operational.</p><p>\"There will be 20 more sites rolling out over the next few years so the minister will be working with service providers to identify where those will be going,\" she said.</p><p>Robinson also addressed part of the government's response to environmental changes with the year-round expansion of the BC Wildfire Service to help mitigate forest fire conditions exasperated by climate change and also a creation of a new land, water and resource stewardship ministry, an off-shoot of the current forestry ministry.</p><p>She said the intent of the new ministry is to funnel more attention and resources on water and land resource issues, and as part of the government's overall reconciliation focus, to give First Nations a larger voice in the decision-making process.</p><p>\"It will allow us to be efficient in the land and water use planning that needs to happen. This new ministry will be tasked with that objective,\" she said.</p><p>Robinson added the new budget allocated $2 billion as a pandemic contingency should another COVID-19 wave hit in the next year, with $2 billion earmarked if needed for the 2023-24 budget.</p><p>\"We thought last fall we were through the toughest part of COVID and that turned out not to be the case when Omicron hit,\" she said.</p><p>\"We need to be ready for whatever the pandemic might throw at us in the year ahead.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Mixed response to 2021-22 school funding challenges</p><p>READ MORE: Trustees left with one viable option for new Westside high school</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Want to support local journalism?

(\"Maxtech\" or the \"Company\") (CSE:MVT)(FRA:M1N)(OTC PINK:MTEHF) is pleased to announce assay results from its continuing Phase One diamond drilling program on the St Anthony gold mine property located in the Kenora-Patricia Mining District, Ontario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Update on the program:</p><p>Metallic screen fire assay (Au-SCR21) of the Visible Gold noted in SA21-18 is underway at ALS Global Laboratories (ALS Global).The Phase One drill program is nearly 50% complete with 2,432 m of the 5,000 m planned drilling completed.The pause in the work program is due to a MNRF Emergency Area Order for most of Northwest Ontario due to the forest fire activity. (MNRF Forest Fire Map) Maxtech will monitor the situation closely and will safely resume its full exploration and drilling activities immediately after the Emergency Area Order is lifted. In the meantime, the new data has been integrated into the project database to better refine future drill targets.Before the pause in the work program two attempts were made to follow-up on the Visible Gold in hole SA21-18. Both holes (SA21-12 &amp; 22) encountered debris filled voids in unrecorded underground workings before reaching target depth and were abandoned.</p><p>Highlights:</p><p>Hole SA21-19 tested the northern strike extent of Zone 2 and intersected:</p><p>2.14 grams per tonne over 1 m at a depth of 99 m,2.38 grams per tonne over 1.25 m at a depth of 203.75 m and1.46 grams per tonne over 1.0 m at a depth of 301.0 m,</p><p>Hole SA21-20 was located on the same section as SA21-19 and intersected:</p><p>1.03 grams per tonne over 1 m at a depth of 165 m,2.34 grams per tonne over 1 m at a depth of 177 m.</p><p>Hole SA21-21 was an attempted to follow--up on visible gold encountered in SA21-18 but encountered problems traversing historical mine working and was abandoned. SA21-21 intersected:</p><p>4.53 grams per tonne over 0.8 m at a depth of 5 m,1.91 grams per tonne over 1 m at a depth of 81 m and5.30 grams per tonne Au over 3.8 m at 141.0 m down the drill.Including 8.54 grams per tonne Au over 2.0 m.</p><p>The two main zones at St. Anthony consist of Zone 1 and Zone 2. Zone 1 is broadly defined over a strike length of 350 metres, with a minimum depth of 200 metres and a true width averaging about 8 metres, based on past production. Historical production focused solely on the vein material and not the adjacent mineralized wallrock.</p><p>Peter Wilson, CEO, stated: \"Maxtech's exploration program continues to deliver strong results including both in the delineation and twinned holes and is indicating a much broader gold system than previously understood. Additionally, due to the unrecorded underground workings encountered it is likely that more high-grade material was removed than ever previously recorded.\"</p><p>Drilling contract and analytical protocols:</p><p>The drilling contract was awarded to Full Force Diamond Drilling Ltd. of Peachland, British Columbia. Drill core samples will be sent to ALS Global of Thunder Bay for gold (Au-AA23) and multi-element (ME-MS61) analysis plus spectral mineralogy data will be collected from selected samples through the mineralized envelope to assist in vectoring to additional gold bearing structures. Maxtech applies industry-standard quality assurance/quality control procedures to the program. Certified reference materials, blanks and field duplicates are included in all drill core batches sent to the laboratory.</p><p>About The St. Anthony Gold Project:</p><p>The St. Anthony Gold Mine is located in the Kenora-Patricia Mining District of Ontario and encompasses four historical mining operations including the largest past-producing mine in the area, the St. Anthony. The mine produced 63,310 ounces of gold from 332,720 tons for an average grade of 5.95 grams per tonne (or 0.191 ounces per ton) up until World War II when gold production was halted. (source: Technical Report on the St. Anthony and Best/King Bay Properties, prepared by Graeme Evans BSc, PGeo, June 16, 2015). The property consists of 233 contiguous claims totaling 4,224 hectares (42.24 sq. km). In addition to the historical underground workings over 20 gold (-silver) occurrences have been documented, some hosting visible gold, many of which have seen little if any exploration work for several decades. Previous workers in the area include Aubet, Can Con and Falconbridge, companies that carried out work focused on the bulk tonnage potential of a mineralized area hosted within a quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusive located within the property. The St. Anthony Gold Project is located 85 km east of the town of Sioux Lookout, or 13 km south of the smaller town of Savant Lake.</p><p>Andrew Tims obtained his B.Sc. in Geology from Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, and is a Registered Professional Geologist in Ontario and Manitoba and a Qualified Person under NI 43-101.
