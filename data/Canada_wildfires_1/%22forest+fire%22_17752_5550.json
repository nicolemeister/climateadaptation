It's a collection of songs about burning things down &amp;#0010;and building them up again, according to her website, and Caspi will be celebrating the release of the album with local performances Mar. 24 and Mar. 25.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's a lot of darkness in the new album,\" Caspi says in an email interview.</p><p>\"Some of it came out of how I was feeling, some of it was watching people around me in tough places or a more global struggle going on around all of us. But I kept looking for the light, for something positive to hang on to. So there is a vein of hope that runs through the album. I called it Forest Fire because the title seemed to evoke that theme &amp;#8211; a big fiery disaster and where it fits in the grand cycle of things.\"</p><p>Caspi has been singing since she was a child, and her roots are classical. Caspi sang in children's choirs when she was young and studied classical voice in high school. She started playing classical guitar as a teenager, and says it wasn't long after she picked up a guitar that she started getting interested in the folk music scene in Ottawa, where she grew up.</p><p>\"I went to a lot of live shows,\" she says.</p><p>\"A lot of the artists I was drawn to were singer-songwriters &amp;#8211; people who wrote their own stuff and performed live, accompanying themselves with just one instrument. I was fascinated by the power and intimacy of that format, and it inspired me to start writing my own songs and play them live.\"</p><p>After studying classical voice at an arts high school in Ottawa, Caspi went on to study music at York University in Toronto.</p><p>\"When I started writing and playing my own music, it took me a long time to find my own natural 'folk' singing voice.</p><p>\"It's very different from my classical singing voice. There are definitely &amp;#0010;useful technical skills that come from classical singing, but ultimately, the sound and feel is very different. My voice has evolved a lot since I've been doing folk music, and I think it's a lot softer and more relaxed now. I feel like it's still a work in progress.\"</p><p>Caspi says her classical guitar training has been a big influence on the finger-picking guitar style she uses to accompany herself.</p><p>\"I try to make the guitar accompaniment as full as possible, incorporating melodic and rhythmic elements into my guitar playing,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's a gentle, lyrical finger-picking style that's inspired by classical guitar.\"</p><p>As a touring musician, Caspi has a chance to see a lot of different landscapes, and she has started painting them as a way to &amp;#0010;share what she sees. She sells her miniature paintings at her shows, and her paintings are featured on the front and back covers of Forest Fire, as well as throughout the album artwork.</p><p>Caspi remembers that she started painting after returning from her first tour in northern Ontario, which was more or less the start of her touring career.</p><p>\"I drove from Toronto to Thunder Bay and back, and I saw these stunning landscapes that I never knew were there,\" she says.</p><p>\"It was overwhelming. I took tons of photos, and when got home, I felt compelled to share what I'd seen. I wanted to do more than just post the photos, so on a whim, I decided to try painting some of the scenes in those photos &amp;#8211; just to see if I still knew how to do it, years after taking a painting class in university. To my great surprise, people really liked the paintings and wanted to buy them. So I kept traveling and I kept painting, and I've been selling the paintings with my merch at shows. I've made about 150 at this point.\"</p><p>Later this month, Caspi will be touring northern British Columbia for the first time as she celebrates the release of Forest Fire.</p><p>Caspi will perform an all-ages show Mar. 24 at Pen-Y-Bryn Farm at 2911 Kersley Dale Landing Road at 8 p.m. Doors open at 7:30 p.m, and advance tickets are available at Circle 'S' Western Wear, online at penybrynfarm.ca or by contacting Lindsay at 250 510 5508. Baked goods and non-alcoholic refreshments will be available by donation to the Wounded Warriors Battlefield Bike Ride 2018 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://woundedwarriors.ca/bbr18/\">https://woundedwarriors.ca/bbr18/</url>).</p><p>Caspi then travels to Wells, and she will perform Mar. 25 at the Sunset Theatre at 2357 Pooley Street at 7:30 p.m. Bob Campbell will be the opening act for this all-ages show.</p><p>To learn more about Caspi or these shows, visit shawnacaspi.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-3553889</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXV-DHB1-F105-619Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Quesnel Cariboo Observer</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp;

It is currently estimated at 11,362 hectares.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although this fire received approximately 10 millimetres of rain, extremely dry fuel conditions remain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters took advantage of the precipitation, high humidity and low winds to continue consolidating hose lines around the perimeter.

Of these, 18 are not yet under control, 26 are either being held, under control or being observed. There were four new fires confirmed on Monday, Aug. 6, two of which are already been called out, including Parry Sound 38, which was located south of Parry Sound 33. It was confirmed at 0.1 hectares and declared out on Monday, Aug. 6.</p><p>UPDATE (Sunday, Aug. 5, 10:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown once again, to 11,362 hectares and is still not yet under control.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry say it was a challenging, hot and windy day on Aug. 5 and the fire responded as they expected.</p><p>However, even with the challenges and high temperatures, the crews managed to maintain the perimeter of the fire, thanks to the placement of the hose lines. Two minor spot fires on the northeast flank were quickly contained in the morning of Aug. 5.</p><p>Crews have made excellent progress over the last few days and now have hose lines around most of the fire perimeter. More work still needs to be done as crews will work inward to solidify the control lines.</p><p>Some structure protection (sprinklers) will be removed in areas of the fire where full containment has been achieved and the threat from those structures has been removed.</p><p>Some precipitation was reported over the fire on Aug. 5 and the MNRF is hopeful that the interior of the fire receives more rain from the weather system.</p><p>Today (Aug. 6), once again, there is the potential for strong winds. Some unsettled weather may bring some scattered thunderstorms with the possibility of 10 to 15 millimetres of patchy rain. It is anticipated that temperatures will be in the mid to high 20s with high humidity.

The hot, dry weather, coupled with the forecasted southwesterly winds, may cause an increase in fire behaviour and test our fire lines. If such an event occurs, we have the resources to respond appropriately.</p><p>It is important to note that while good progress is being made, the fire remains active. The conditions continue to be very dry, and extreme burning conditions are still possible. Land and water restrictions remain in place at this time for protection of people, property and to allow our crews to do their work. Patrols from OPP and Conservation Officers will continue throughout the area around the fire.</p><p>We continue to work hard to manage Parry Sound 33 in order to get people back into their residences safely.

Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park.

The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 AM on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, &amp; 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Thursday, August 2, 11:40 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,185 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports that Thursday, August 2, was another great day for crews working and laying hose around the perimeter of the fire. Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69.

Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park.

The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

Firefighters from Sudbury were also to begin work in the morning.</p><p>One house on Baker Lake was damaged. No serious injuries have been reported.</p><p>Residents of three trailer parks along the Mattagami River were forced to evacuate soon after the fire broke out at 4:30 p.m. west of the city.</p><p>About 12 homes near Baker Lake, in the fire's path, were also evacuated.</p><p>Evacuees were taken to the McIntyre Community Building in Timmins and were to be moved to local hotels later.</p><p>\"They're going to keep (the residents) out of the area just as a precaution,\" said one police officer.</p><p>Mayor Vic Power had declared a state of emergency.</p><p>Burning along a 200-hectare front, the fire jumped the 120- metre wide Mattagami River and forced the closing of Highway 101 West. The highway reopened last night.</p><p>Legouffe said the fire threatened to destroy several trailer parks and a built-up area containing homes and cottages.</p><p>Several water bombers were brought in to help control the flames and eight crews from local fire departments and ministry fire crews were on the ground.</p><p>Weather looked to be on the side of the firefighters. Rain was expected overnight.</p><p>\"They are pretty upset and concerned,\" said Kathy Worman, branch manager for the Timmins and District Red Cross society. \"The fire could destroy everything they own.\"</p><p>She said some people had managed to gather some belongings and valuables before they fled their homes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S7T-72W0-008G-G53T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"391\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"05\" day=\"30\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 30, 1997, Friday, FINAL EDITION</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CY7S</classCode><className>TRAILER PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We are also in the anthropocene extinction, the current and ongoing extinction of species as a result of human activity. If we continue to do business as usual we will become extinct. I am not willing to let that happen without a fight, so we need to embrace the Green New Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate scientists (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are sounding the alarm. We must keep global warming below 1.5 C. We are seeing the results of global warming all across the globe, including here in Canada. There were devastating forest fires in B.C. in 2017 and 2018, the forest fire that wiped out parts of Fort McMurray, the flooding in Calgary, and much more. Those events will continue to escalate, happening with greater frequency and intensity.</p><p>I recently visited a friend in Prince George. She suffered terribly from inhaling forest fire smoke. She is one of many.</p><p>Last year I visited Tombstone Territorial Park in the Yukon. We walked beside the North Klondike River. There was ice on the far side that is millions of years old. We watched parts of it calve off into the river. The temperature was 31 C. The Arctic is heating up. Researchers describe how warming in the Arctic, which is heating up 2.4 times faster than the Northern Hemisphere average, is triggering a cascade of changes in everything from when plants flower to where fish and other animal populations can be found.</p><p>Warmer temperatures have shifted forest and tundra growing seasons, boosted rain and snowfall, increased melting, accelerated glaciers and possibly even increased the number of lightning strikes that could increase the risk of Arctic wildfires in the tundra and boreal forest, clearly a signal of climate warming.</p><p>Governments and individuals need to take action. There is plenty we can do.</p><p>&amp;#8226; invest in and subsidize renewable energy.</p><p>&amp;#8226; retrofit automobile plants to make electric vehicles (which happily I am seeing more and more of on our roads).</p><p>&amp;#8226; build more and better public transportation</p><p>All of the jobs created by these can be filled by many people, including people who currently work in the oil and gas industry. The government should provide funding and education for them to transition.</p><p>Indigenous people have important knowledge about mitigating climate change, and their rights should be upheld as stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), including the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), and the 94 Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p><p>Affordable housing in another area that can help to mitigate climate change. There is an excellent example, Nanaimo Aboriginal Centre, that is Passive House Certified, which incorporates initiatives and technologies that reduce energy use and operational costs over conventional building standards. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/media-newsroom/news-releases/2018/affordable-homes-indigenous-people-open-nanaimo\">https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/media-newsroom/news-releases/2018/affordable-homes-indigenous-people-open-nanaimo</url></p><p>The service sector in Canada supports a great number of jobs that are low carbon. The Green New Deal recognizes them and would provide increased funding after years of cuts. Our communities would become stronger and more caring.</p><p>The Green New Deal not only tackles the climate crisis. It includes implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and stopping the rise of racism. Now is the time for us to come together as one and give it everything we've got. Thank you in advance for embracing the Green New Deal.</p><p>With Hope,</p><p>Diana Hardacker</p><p>Chemainus</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-3849177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSK-WX11-JDH1-C10T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cowichan Citizen</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 9, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

With the most recent changes to the weather forecast for many parts of the province, reducing the chance of rain showers and forecasting continued high temperatures, it's likely the fire risks will continue to rise.</p><p>And that's where you come in.</p><p>Right now, 162 forest fires are burning across British Columbia, and mandatory evacuations have moved thousands of people from their homes. So far this year, the B.C. Wildfire Service has had to deal with 572 fires, and while many have been started by natural causes like lightning strikes and have been fanned by wind, a whopping 258 of the fires that have been investigated (and some are still under investigation) were started by humans.</p><p>The causes include cigarettes thrown from moving vehicles to unattended or smoldering campfires to ATVs travelling over dry grass that flares from contact with hot exhaust parts.</p><p>In British Columbia, getting a handle on human causes has meant stronger enforcement and higher fines in recent years - violating a campfire ban, for example, can cost you $1,100. That errant cigarette butt? $575. Being convicted for starting a fire can carry a penalty of a year in jail and $100,000 in fines.</p><p>In this province, the fines are considerably lower.</p><p>But that doesn't mean we can afford to be careless. The temptations are obvious: a summer day on a river fishing seems tailor-made for a boil-up on the foreshore, and a camping trip just doesn't seem complete without an evening campfire under the stars, especially as a hot day cools into a soft evening.</p><p>Just remember that everything around you - the trees shouldering down to the river, the forest surrounding your favourite pond - can change for decades because of a forest fire burnover.</p><p>The hard part about preventing human-caused forest fires is making people understand that a moment's carelessness can't be undone.</p><p>And no matter how genuinely sorry you are about it afterwards, it won't make a whit of difference.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f14b8313c8004be1ba5b8544ed30d10f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2F-7MM1-DY9S-T1Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><timeReceived>02:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 19, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park.

The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

The fire remains approximately seven kilometres west of Highway 69 and three kilometres south of the Pickerel River and is nearly 100 kilometres north of Parry Sound.</p><p>For most of Saturday, July 28, winds from the southwest continued, keeping the northeast side as the most active part of the fire. Priority remains along the northeast side of the fire with fingers extending toward the CN rail line as minimal movement occurred across the tracks. Additionally, there was minimal growth along the southwest portion of the fire.</p><p>Hose lay and containment will continue along the northern portion as crews look to secure that area.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (8:20 a.m. Saturday, July 28) - Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and continues to grow.</p><p>In a news release sent out at 12:35 a.m. on July 28, the fire has grown to 7,297 hectares. Due to the southwest winds, the northeast side is the most active part of the fire.</p><p>The northeast side of the fire is the focus for Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry water bombers and helicopter bucketing, as it is closest to the rail line and more populated areas.</p><p>There has been minimal growth on the southwest end of the fire.</p><p>Southwest winds are expected to continue tomorrow, possibly bringing heavy smoke conditions periodically into surrounding commentates and along Highway 69. The fire is approximately seven kilometres west of Highway 69 and three kilometres south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>Wildfire crews continue to make progress around the southwest side of the perimeter by laying hose lines and actively attacking hot spots in the Key Harbour. That area is protected and the MNRF does not expect any movement in that area over the next few days.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 p.m. Thursday, July 26): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry reports Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and growing.</p><p>According to the ministry in a news release dated 11:55 p.m., Thursday, July 26, by the evening of July 26 there were 45 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 15 are not yet under control, 30 are either being held, under control or being observed. Of the 15 not under control, Parry Sound 33 is one of them.</p><p>As of July 26, the fire is estimated at 6,760 hectares and there was minimal grown on the north, west and south end of the fire. The implementation order and all access restriction, including water access restriction, remain in place. The southwest winds are expected to continue today, possibly gusting from 30 to 40 kilometres per hour. Unfortunately, there is minimal precipitation in the forecast.</p><p>\"Crews continue to make excellent progress around the southwest side of the perimeter, laying hose and working on hotspots north and south of Key River,\" reads the release.\"Today's focus was on the north and east flank of the fire, which were once again active due to sustained southern and southwesterly winds. The fire did put on some growth along the east flank, with one area of the fire crossing both Tower Lake and impacting the CN rail in one location.\"</p><p>Continued growth of the fire is expected on the northeast flank today. Water bombers and helicopters worked most of the day halting or slowing the spread of the fire. Values protection, or sprinklers, continue to be placed along Pickerel River and began in Henvey Inlet as a precautionary measure.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 a.m. Wednesday, July 25): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Fire has expanded Northeast region restricted fire zone.</p><p>Due to strong, warmer and drier lake effect winds the ministry required aerial fire suppression yesterday, July 25, as fire activity increased. As a result of the the southwest winds, smoke was pushed across Highway 69 and into some communities to the east of the fire.</p><p>Resources yesterday included CL415 water bombers, two bird dog aircraft, heavy helicopters T802 amphibious aircraft and ground crews, the ministry reports.</p><p>Additional crews from Mexico arrived on the fire today, bringing the total number of firefighters helping to suppress the fire to 90. Values protection, or sprinklers, will continue to be put in place on structures along the Pickerel River today.</p><p>\"Given the unpredictability of the fire, all access restrictions, including water restrictions, remain in place for the foreseeable future,\" reads a ministry press release. \"In the interest of public safety, on July 21, 2018 the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF)'s Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area below impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only: All areas ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay.\"</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the ministry Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>By the evening of July 25 there were 50 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 16 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There were two new fires confirmed in the region today. Hearst 14, located approximately 42 kilometres south of Hearst, is two hectares and not yet under control. Two crews provided initial attack on the fire with aerial suppression support. Wawa 11 is being held at 0.1 hectares 75 kilometres southeast of Longlac.</p><p>(Tuesday, July 24, 11:10 p.m.):The fire is expected to remain relatively quiet for the next couple of days.</p><p>\"However, fire conditions and behaviour can change quickly. Crews continue to monitor weather and fire behaviour closely. Residents will see smoke in the area as crews continue suppression efforts. Values protection have been put in place in Key Harbour, along parts of the south side of Pickerel River and along a portion of the train tracks east of the fire.\"</p><p>A total of eight helicopters worked the fire on July 24.</p><p>As of July 24 the fire was at 5,612 hectares and still not under control.</p><p>The cause of the fire was originally stated as \"human\" on the MNR's website but that classification has since been removed, McCool said, to avoid public speculation.</p><p>\"Because the cause is still unknown at this time and it is under investigation.\"</p><p>(11:59 p.m., Monday, July 23): The Key River forest fire, known as Parry Sound 33, is now covering an area of 5,612 hectares and the restricted fire zone has been expanded to north of Rosseau.</p><p>According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, Parry Sound 33 saw aerial fire suppression again on Monday, July 23. CL415s dropped water on the fire which was remapped at 5,612 hectares. Three heavy helicopters bucketed water to reduce the fire's intensity and co-ordinated with ground crews.</p><p>On July 21, the MNRF's Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only.</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the MNRF Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>In addition, the MNRF's Sudbury district has recommended that all residents along Hartley Bay Road be placed on an evacuation alert, pending changes to the fire situation.</p><p>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Conservation Officers have been on site helping notify the public of the situation, and facilitating this evacuation.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) has also been advised by Ontario Parks that the French River Provincial Park is fully closed west of Highway 69/400. All campers have been or are being evacuated. Ontario Parks has also suspended permit sales for the French River Delta and Pickerel River areas and are restricting entry to park users (everything west of Highway 69/400).</p><p>Henvey Inlet First Nation declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure. As of July 22, the community has successfully and safely evacuated all of its community members, who are receiving accommodation and food.</p><p>By the evening of July 23 there were 55 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 21 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There was only one new start in the region today. Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>RESTRICTED FIRE ZONES</p><p>Restricted fire zone has expanded to additional parts of the northeast fire region (southern region)</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire activity, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include parts of the southern region of Ontario as outlined on the interactive map. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current MNRF Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts have been expanded in the vicinity of the Parry Sound 33 fire. For details, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072447033912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYW-1P61-JDH3-G4BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3923\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

If it's for a fire in town where it's serving the fire department, we may only have two or three volunteers at a time on it. But then we also rotate them with a shift because we don't want to burn out our volunteers either.\"</p><p>Getting the vehicle on Friday is the culmination of a process years in the making. Initially, Kristensen began inquiring after getting one of these units when she was with the Salvation Army back in 2003. Kristensen worked here from 2003 to 2007, before Major Green came in.</p><p>\"The East Kootenays doesn't have a lot of really serious forest fires in this region,\" Kristensen said, \"so areas that have had more fires have gotten the vehicles ahead of us. But it's been a long process because all of the vehicles are donated, and by the time they're fully equipped you're looking at probably $150,000 to $200,000 per vehicle.</p><p>This particular vehicle comes all equipped and set up from Kelowna. The Salvation Army there recently got a new one, which is a freightliner, helping them to navigate around the central region of B.C.</p><p>\"So I started the process to get the vehicle and then I get it,\" she said with a laugh. \"Kirk is not so impressed with that because he worked very hard in the intervening 12 years to get it here as well.\"</p><p>Kristensen said they will be taking the unit down to Fernie where Green is now stationed, for their Santa Claus parade, where they can serve coffee and hot chocolate from it.</p><p>\"We don't want it just sitting in a warehouse or someplace for the winter and not being used other than when there's say a forest fire, we want to make sure we're using the vehicle in a very proactive, community-minded way.\"</p><p>Kristensen said everyone at the Salvation Army is thrilled to finally see this come to fruition, after hearing about it for so long.</p><p>The keys to the vehicle were handed over at 4 p.m. from divisional emergency disaster services director John McEwan from Abbotsford who brought it up to Cranbrook to pass it over to Kristensen</p><p>They are still in the process of finding a place to keep it warm and safe over the winter months, so if you or someone you know has some warehouse space, give the Salvation Army a call.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:paul.rodgers@cranbrooktownsman.comLike\">paul.rodgers@cranbrooktownsman.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-3896137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDH-FWC1-F103-30NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cranbrook Townsman</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>THE SALVATION ARMY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Wildlife Service firefighters and support administrative staff began in June dealing with Okanagan Lake flooding, switched quickly to forest fires and now face drought concerns as the summer winds down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's been a long, long season and frankly I'm exhausted,\" said Rob Schweitzer, the Kamloops Fire Centre manager.</p><p>\"At one point we had some 44,000 people evacuated from their homes across the province. It's hard not to meet anyone not impacted by these fires everywhere you go.\"</p><p>But he says the million dollar question remains unanswered-is this fire season the new normal or just a freak aberration.</p><p>\"I hope it's not the new normal or I may have chosen the wrong job,\" laughed Schweitzer, who has been in his current position for just over a year.</p><p>\"To my way of thinking, I think this summer reflects a new change and to rethink the idea to suppress forest fires at all costs may not be the most reasonable, cost-effective approach.\"</p><p>He noted that besides B.C.'s forest fire escalation, a similar story is occurring regarding wildfires in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and California.</p><p>Schweitzer made the comments while speaking to the Okanagan Water Stewardship Council on Thursday.</p><p>He said the cost to fight B.C's fires this summer sits at $473 million and is forecast to reach $680 million. As a comparison, he cited that in 2003, the year of the Okanagan Mountain Park, the forest fire suppression bill came in at $375 million.</p><p>Schweitzer said this year has produced record fires in size, led by the Elephant Hill blaze at 192,725 hectares covering territory in both the Kamloops and Cariboo fire centre regions, and it's still only 50 per cent contained.</p><p>In the Okanagan, he said the Philpott Fire currently sits at 465 hectares and is 70 per cent contained, while the Finley Creek fire, between Summerland and Peachland, has burned 1,000 hectares and is 15 per cent contained.</p><p>He said the number and size of fires this year are simply staggering in comparison to past years, jumping the U.S.-Canada border in some cases and crossing fire zone boundaries which is unusual.</p><p>\"It just speaks to the size of some of these fires,\" he noted.</p><p>He expects the review of the fire season this fall and winter coupled with a the new NDP government in place could potentially produce some philosophic changes in how the province battles forest fires in the future.</p><p>\"What the best solutions are we're not sure of at this point, but I do feel the wildfire service is in a good position to become an all-hazard response agency and to move into the land management aspect on a greater level with forest fire prevention practices,\" he said.</p><p>But those practices raise other issues such as providing the resources and funding to better manage the fuel buildup on the forest floor, the planting of commercially viable trees that are also more susceptible to fire, and preserving riparian zones for environment habitat protection that can feed forest fires.</p><p>\"That was one of the issues with the Elephant Hill fire. It would run out of timber but come across these riparian zones and you could see it taking off again when it got into those tree stands,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-3430612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PF8-6WV1-F105-63SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Country Calendar (Winfield)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 8, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001981</classCode><className>LAYOFFS &amp; DISMISSALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL88</classCode><className>ADMINISTRATIVE &amp; CLERICAL WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DSJF</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DSJF</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009Y84</classCode><className>NORTHWEST USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Monday, July 30, 11:52 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire reportedly expanded by 749 hectares on Monday, reaching 8,973 hectares, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64. For more information on the evacuation, call the municipality at 705-898-2294 or visit frenchriver.ca.</p><p>#OPP #MNRF #NER reminding the public that if you access the Key, French or Pickerel Rivers by boat or plane you will be charged.

The fire remains approximately seven kilometres west of Highway 69 and three kilometres south of the Pickerel River and is nearly 100 kilometres north of Parry Sound.</p><p>For most of Saturday, July 28, winds from the southwest continued, keeping the northeast side as the most active part of the fire. Priority remains along the northeast side of the fire with fingers extending toward the CN rail line as minimal movement occurred across the tracks. Additionally, there was minimal growth along the southwest portion of the fire.</p><p>Hose lay and containment will continue along the northern portion as crews look to secure that area.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (8:20 a.m. Saturday, July 28) - Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and continues to grow.</p><p>In a news release sent out at 12:35 a.m. on July 28, the fire has grown to 7,297 hectares. Due to the southwest winds, the northeast side is the most active part of the fire.</p><p>The northeast side of the fire is the focus for Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry water bombers and helicopter bucketing, as it is closest to the rail line and more populated areas.</p><p>There has been minimal growth on the southwest end of the fire.</p><p>Southwest winds are expected to continue tomorrow, possibly bringing heavy smoke conditions periodically into surrounding commentates and along Highway 69. The fire is approximately seven kilometres west of Highway 69 and three kilometres south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>Wildfire crews continue to make progress around the southwest side of the perimeter by laying hose lines and actively attacking hot spots in the Key Harbour. That area is protected and the MNRF does not expect any movement in that area over the next few days.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 p.m. Thursday, July 26): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry reports Parry Sound 33 is still not under control and growing.</p><p>According to the ministry in a news release dated 11:55 p.m., Thursday, July 26, by the evening of July 26 there were 45 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 15 are not yet under control, 30 are either being held, under control or being observed. Of the 15 not under control, Parry Sound 33 is one of them.</p><p>As of July 26, the fire is estimated at 6,760 hectares and there was minimal grown on the north, west and south end of the fire. The implementation order and all access restriction, including water access restriction, remain in place. The southwest winds are expected to continue today, possibly gusting from 30 to 40 kilometres per hour. Unfortunately, there is minimal precipitation in the forecast.</p><p>\"Crews continue to make excellent progress around the southwest side of the perimeter, laying hose and working on hotspots north and south of Key River,\" reads the release.\"Today's focus was on the north and east flank of the fire, which were once again active due to sustained southern and southwesterly winds. The fire did put on some growth along the east flank, with one area of the fire crossing both Tower Lake and impacting the CN rail in one location.\"</p><p>Continued growth of the fire is expected on the northeast flank today. Water bombers and helicopters worked most of the day halting or slowing the spread of the fire. Values protection, or sprinklers, continue to be placed along Pickerel River and began in Henvey Inlet as a precautionary measure.</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE: (11:55 a.m. Wednesday, July 25): The Ministry of Natural Resources and Fire has expanded Northeast region restricted fire zone.</p><p>Due to strong, warmer and drier lake effect winds the ministry required aerial fire suppression yesterday, July 25, as fire activity increased. As a result of the the southwest winds, smoke was pushed across Highway 69 and into some communities to the east of the fire.</p><p>Resources yesterday included CL415 water bombers, two bird dog aircraft, heavy helicopters T802 amphibious aircraft and ground crews, the ministry reports.</p><p>Additional crews from Mexico arrived on the fire today, bringing the total number of firefighters helping to suppress the fire to 90. Values protection, or sprinklers, will continue to be put in place on structures along the Pickerel River today.</p><p>\"Given the unpredictability of the fire, all access restrictions, including water restrictions, remain in place for the foreseeable future,\" reads a ministry press release. \"In the interest of public safety, on July 21, 2018 the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF)'s Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area below impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only: All areas ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay.\"</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the ministry Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>By the evening of July 25 there were 50 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 16 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There were two new fires confirmed in the region today. Hearst 14, located approximately 42 kilometres south of Hearst, is two hectares and not yet under control. Two crews provided initial attack on the fire with aerial suppression support. Wawa 11 is being held at 0.1 hectares 75 kilometres southeast of Longlac.</p><p>(Tuesday, July 24, 11:10 p.m.):The fire is expected to remain relatively quiet for the next couple of days.</p><p>\"However, fire conditions and behaviour can change quickly. Crews continue to monitor weather and fire behaviour closely. Residents will see smoke in the area as crews continue suppression efforts. Values protection have been put in place in Key Harbour, along parts of the south side of Pickerel River and along a portion of the train tracks east of the fire.\"</p><p>A total of eight helicopters worked the fire on July 24.</p><p>As of July 24 the fire was at 5,612 hectares and still not under control.</p><p>The cause of the fire was originally stated as \"human\" on the MNR's website but that classification has since been removed, McCool said, to avoid public speculation.</p><p>\"Because the cause is still unknown at this time and it is under investigation.\"</p><p>(11:59 p.m., Monday, July 23): The Key River forest fire, known as Parry Sound 33, is now covering an area of 5,612 hectares and the restricted fire zone has been expanded to north of Rosseau.</p><p>According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, Parry Sound 33 saw aerial fire suppression again on Monday, July 23. CL415s dropped water on the fire which was remapped at 5,612 hectares. Three heavy helicopters bucketed water to reduce the fire's intensity and co-ordinated with ground crews.</p><p>On July 21, the MNRF's Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only.</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the MNRF Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>In addition, the MNRF's Sudbury district has recommended that all residents along Hartley Bay Road be placed on an evacuation alert, pending changes to the fire situation.</p><p>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Conservation Officers have been on site helping notify the public of the situation, and facilitating this evacuation.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) has also been advised by Ontario Parks that the French River Provincial Park is fully closed west of Highway 69/400. All campers have been or are being evacuated. Ontario Parks has also suspended permit sales for the French River Delta and Pickerel River areas and are restricting entry to park users (everything west of Highway 69/400).</p><p>Henvey Inlet First Nation declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure. As of July 22, the community has successfully and safely evacuated all of its community members, who are receiving accommodation and food.</p><p>By the evening of July 23 there were 55 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 21 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There was only one new start in the region today. Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>RESTRICTED FIRE ZONES</p><p>Restricted fire zone has expanded to additional parts of the northeast fire region (southern region)</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire activity, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include parts of the southern region of Ontario as outlined on the interactive map. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current MNRF Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts have been expanded in the vicinity of the Parry Sound 33 fire. For details, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072447025732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYM-F401-F105-63GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Plus not 30 extra parking spaces but around 140 non-existent spaces will force attendees to plug narrow streets on both sides of Anne Street seven days a week and up to 11:30 p.m. or later in spring, summer, fall and winter, making snow removal and resident parking (already stretched thin due to single dwellings renovated into multiple dwellings) almost impossible.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Allan S.

Innes isn't sure how easy that will be because, he says, \"If they are going to give you a water licence, they want to know that you are actually making use of it because there is lots of demand for licences.</p><p>\"Do we need it connected to make the system work right now? The answer is no.\"</p><p>But in the event of an emergency such as a forest fire, the need could be immediate.</p><p>If there are no emergencies, city calculations state that Five Mile Creek will not be able to meet Nelson's winter needs by 2066 and by that same year the summer requirements would be met only by a narrow margin.</p><p>While working on the Clearwater Creek licence process, the city plans to pipe water from two current secondary sources at Selous Creek and Anderson Creek to the main reservoir at Mountain Station so the water can be treated and the source is centralized. These creeks currently feed into small secondary reservoirs with no ultraviolet water treatment.</p><p>But water from Selous and Anderson Creeks, used now in the event of summer drought, will not be enough on their own to supplement the main Five Mile Creek source over the years or in case of emergency, Innes says, hence the planned addition of Clearwater Creek.</p><p>Stage 1: Selous Creek</p><p>The Selous Creek intake is a short distance south of town near Highway 6 and is currently used only in the event of summer drought. The city plans to pipe Selous Creek water along the rail trail and then veer off through Crown land such that the water reaches the Mountain Station reservoir by gravity feed.</p><p>\"The challenge,\" says Innes, \"is that we are wanting to have access along the rail trail, and this will be disruptive. So they want us to do that outside of summer. Realistically we would have to do that in phases.\"</p><p>He said this project could be completed two years from now.</p><p>Stage 2: Anderson Creek</p><p>Water from Anderson Creek in Fairview will be pumped up to the Mountain Station reservoir. Engineering work and pipe-laying means the process will take another two years after the Selous Creek work is completed.</p><p>Last year the city received a $6 million grant from the federal government's gas tax fund for the Selous and Anderson creek diversion projects.</p><p>Stage 3: Clearwater Creek</p><p>After the Selous and Anderson Creek work, new pipe from a new intake at Clearwater Creek will join the Selous Creek line described in Stage 1. Innes expects water to be flowing from Clearwater Creek into the Mountain Station reservoir about six years from now, \"if all the stars align.\"</p><p>At the Union of BC Municipalities conference in September, Mayor John Dooley met with provincial forests minister Doug Donaldson to try to expedite the granting of the Clearwater Creek licence.</p><p>Dooley says he has no illusions about the effectiveness of meeting with ministers at the UBCM conference.</p><p>\"You are basically just opening the door a crack,\" he said. \"But it is never a bad thing to talk with the minister so they can understand the urgency of your request and pull your file to the top if possible.\"</p><p>Related:</p><p>Nelson council adopts water plan</p><p>Nelson ponders new drinking water sources, updates water plan</p><p>Nelson gets $6 million for water upgrade</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3889537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBC-RW71-JDH1-C321-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541330GM</classCode><className>CIVIL ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N221310MM</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001575</classCode><className>SKIING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541330GM</classCode><className>CIVIL ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N221310MM</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) _ An Australian fire expert is recommending a radical way to defend your property against wildfire: stay at home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John Gledhill says people have a better chance of surviving a wildfire and protecting their houses if they remain indoors. Once the worst of the fire passes, homeowners can run outside with tools as simple as a wet mop and bucket to extinguish hot spots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The house itself provides greater protection against radiant heat, so people can shelter in the house while the fire is burning adjacent to their properties,'' Gledhill said Friday.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>CP</p></bodyText></section><p>\"It's not just theory. It's born out of experience and practice, and we've tested it.''</p><p>The Tasmanian approach to surviving a forest fire is based on a simple strategy: create a defensible space around your home by removing forest fuels and other flammable material; use fire-resistant building materials; and prepare to fight the fire with tools and water.</p><p>Years of fire research in Australia suggest that 90 per cent of property damage is not caused by a wall of flames entering a subdivision, but from the ember showers the fire throws ahead of itself, Gledhill said.</p><p>A thousand homes in Tasmania were \"under attack'' from a forest fire in 1998, but only seven were lost, he said. Six of them were unoccupied. In most of the surviving homes, residents stayed put.</p><p>\"We find now the only houses we've lost are when no one is present,'' said Gledhill, chief officer of the Tasmanian fire service. \"Having residents undertake fire extinguishing to fight fires on their properties enables firefighters to be deployed to the most critical areas.</p><p>\"It extends the ability of limited firefighting resources much more widely,'' he said.</p><p>During last summer's forest fire in Kelowna, a handful of south Kelowna residents refused to evacuate when the Aug. 22 firestorm razed more than 200 houses. A few managed to save their homes, but others criticized them for putting their lives at risk.</p><p>Gledhill admitted there's no way to fight a rank-six crown fire, like the one that stormed into the South Mission last summer. But, he said, if flames are on the ground, residents don't face the same exposure to extreme heat.</p><p>And Gledhill said, evacuating people could be more dangerous than letting them stay.</p><p>He pointed to the California fires last fall, when most of the 22 people killed were caught while trying to flee.</p><p>\"People leave evacuation to the last minute. And knowing who to evacuate is another issue,'' he said. \"We recognize the need to evacuate if preparation hasn't been done. But (staying home) isn't as crazy as it may seem.''</p><p>Success depends on how prepared a homeowner is, he said. A community needs a buffer zone beyond the interface, where the forest meets the urban fringe. And metal roofs, not wooden shakes, are effective shields against flying embers.</p><p>\"With wood-shake roofs, you might as well put gasoline on the roof,'' Gledhill said. \"Australia has long since banned them. Metal roofs are the standard.''</p><p>B.C. Forest Service officials point to the differences in foliage, forest types and flat terrain in Tasmania as a key reason for the diverging firefighting strategies.</p><p>Jim Mottishaw, manager of the Penticton fire zone, said propane tanks caused significant explosions during last summer's forest fires, something residents would have been ill-prepared to defend against.</p><p>\"Smoke was so thick, you couldn't breathe in some situations,'' he said. \"You couldn't see five feet in front of you.''</p><p>Residents stayed behind in Barriere when fire roared through the North Thompson valley last summer, but they had little effect against the flames.</p><p>Even though they had apparatus, they couldn't fight it.</p><p>\"Smoke conditions and fire forced them to stay hunkered down at a safety zone,'' Mottishaw said. ''In Australia, it's flatter country. Flash fires can be very intense. In some rural grasslands, the house may be a safe refuge.''</p><p>Gledhill argues B.C. and Tasmania are similar.</p><p>The island harbours dense forests of eucalyptus trees and some of the tallest hardwoods in the world. They may be different from the coniferous forests of the Okanagan, but they're all flammable.</p><p>The fact wood-shake roofs are permitted in Canada suggests construction materials in B.C. are not as fire-resistant as in Australia. And B.C. officials might be capable of co-ordinating better evacuations.</p><p>Fifty-thousand British Columbians were ordered out of their homes last summer, and not one was injured or killed.</p><p>\"It is very controversial. But in North America, with fuel types, homes and the conditions we have, we're looking after responders and the public first, and then properties as best we can under safe conditions,'' Mottishaw said.</p><p>Kelowna Courier</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20040515CPCPD6788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4CD2-9BS0-01G6-9026-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>May 15, 2004 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>B C FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>A BETTER CHANCE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT; POLITICS; FORESTRY;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLQ1</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLQ1</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST0008XKH</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS &amp; COMPONENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Monday, July 30, 11:52 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire reportedly expanded by 749 hectares on Monday, reaching 8,973 hectares, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site.

Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>RESTRICTED FIRE ZONES</p><p>Restricted fire zone has expanded to additional parts of the northeast fire region (southern region)</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire activity, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include parts of the southern region of Ontario as outlined on the interactive map. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current MNRF Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts have been expanded in the vicinity of the Parry Sound 33 fire. For details, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072447015560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYD-HRP1-F105-6083-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The government attributes the blazes to dry weather and flame-fanning winds. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903157040680672425176100172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6X-9X91-F03R-N0FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"252\"/><timeReceived>00:06:46ZInvalid date found for VDI: DIJO100903157040680672425176100172 XCEDOCID: 5917 LNI: 5X6X-9X91-F03R-N0FK-00000-00.

But he wasn't expecting to get much sleep and didn't know how long they would have to stay away from home.</p><p>The fire appeared dangerously close to Hillcrest, said Kazmir, who could see flames on top of a nearby hill.</p><p>Another Hillcrest resident, Rick Waldner, 48, said he really didn't expect the evacuation would happen, even though the town had been on alert for days.</p><p>\"After a week, you kind of figure it's going to miss you. It surprised the crap out of me,'' he said.</p><p>But he said he wasn't worried. \"About what _ possessions? No. Family is all safe,'' said Waldner.</p><p>\"Even watching that fire come down the hill to town, it's concerning but not terrifying,'' he added stoically.</p><p>About 840 firefighters were trying to contain the blaze, which covered about 160 square kilometres.</p><p>Crews were doing a backburn on a nearby mountain ridge and a steady stream of helicopters were dropping buckets of water on the forest fire.</p><p>Ground crews were supported by four water bombers, 20 helicopters, 34 bulldozers and 20 water trucks.</p><p>\"The community is fighting all they can,'' said Hillcrest resident Pat Bradley.</p><p>\"There's air power. There's land power. There are workers trying their darndest to save our homes,'' Bradley said.</p><p>\"We've lived here in the Crowsnest Pass for 30 years,'' she added. \"It's a beautiful place to live. I'm not so sure it's going to be that way once everything is finished.''</p><p>Public access to the area remained restricted. The hot, dry conditions have also prompted Parks Canada to impose fire bans in Jasper, Banff, Yoho, Kootenay, Waterton and Glacier-Revelstoke national parks.</p><p>Thick smoke from a fire inside Jasper National Park, called the Syncline Ridge fire, forced park officials to close a 35-kilometre section of Highway 16 for almost eight hours Friday, on the eve of Jasper's annual folk festival and one of its busiest long weekends.</p><p>Fire crews managed to contain that blaze Saturday.</p><p>\"The risk is much reduced now,'' said Parks Canada spokesman Ifan Thomas.</p><p>About 40 forest fires were burning in Alberta on Saturday. Twelve of them were out of control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20030803CPCPG9464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:496V-S9Y0-01G6-94NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>August 3, 2003 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; FORESTRY; POLITICS;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N212110CC</classCode><className>COAL MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 AM on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, &amp; 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Thursday, August 2, 11:40 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,185 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports that Thursday, August 2, was another great day for crews working and laying hose around the perimeter of the fire. Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park.

The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>In addition, the MNRF's Sudbury district has recommended that all residents along Hartley Bay Road be placed on an evacuation alert, pending changes to the fire situation.</p><p>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Conservation Officers have been on site helping notify the public of the situation, and facilitating this evacuation.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) has also been advised by Ontario Parks that the French River Provincial Park is fully closed west of Highway 69/400. All campers have been or are being evacuated. Ontario Parks has also suspended permit sales for the French River Delta and Pickerel River areas and are restricting entry to park users (everything west of Highway 69/400).</p><p>Henvey Inlet First Nation declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure. As of July 22, the community has successfully and safely evacuated all of its community members, who are receiving accommodation and food.</p><p>By the evening of July 23 there were 55 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 21 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There was only one new start in the region today. Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>RESTRICTED FIRE ZONES</p><p>Restricted fire zone has expanded to additional parts of the northeast fire region (southern region)</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire activity, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include parts of the southern region of Ontario as outlined on the interactive map. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on July 24, and will remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25, and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current MNRF Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts have been expanded in the vicinity of the Parry Sound 33 fire. For details, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072447044943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T08-F7V1-JDH3-G00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(CP) _ The old adages about time healing all wounds and forgiving and forgetting seem to hold sway in this tiny community, where the devastation of a massive forest fire two years ago is still almost as evident as if it had burned last month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cause of the Barriere-McLure forest fire, according to a guilty verdict rendered Monday in provincial court in Kamloops, was Mike Barre, a 52-year-old McLure resident, who dropped a cigarette behind his house.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But his seemingly insignificant act, something likely done by people hundreds of times a day in Canada, occurred in a tinder-dry forest, in one of the worst forest fire seasons in British Columbia in many decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The resulting fire, raging for days, melting equipment and vehicles in its path, destroyed more than 70 homes and businesses and a sawmill and forced hundreds of people to evacuate. It eventually grew to more than 260 square kilometres in size and cost the B.C. Ministry of Forests more than $31 million to fight.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>CP</p></bodyText></section><p>The aftermath of the fire is inescapable to anyone driving along the Yellowhead Highway that cuts through McLure, Louis Creek and Barriere in the southcentral Interior. Kilometre after kilometre, the mountainsides still resemble a barren moonscape, with the trees now skinny, blackened sticks.</p><p>In Louis Creek, the fire jumped across the North Thompson River, leaving its ugly scars on both sides of the highways, as far as the eye can see. This part of the province is dry and arid most of the year, which means it will be many years before the obliterated topography is transformed.</p><p>Despite the devastation, it's hard to find a person who has a harsh word to say about Barre, who still lives in the area and who will return to court Nov. 29 to hear his sentence, which the Crown has said will likely be a fine in the $1,500 range.</p><p>Rick Appel has every reason to scowl at the mention of Barre's name, but he in fact organized a petition of support for Barre, generating 1,400 names in an area with a population of about 3,500.</p><p>\"He's suffered a lot and he doesn't deserve it,'' Appel said Tuesday in his rural yard, which also serves as his welding operation.</p><p>\"I know Mike and his family and I know he wouldn't do that on purpose,'' said Appel, who lost his house, boat and a lot of equipment when the fire tore through his property.</p><p>Appel and some others who talked about the verdict Tuesday said they blamed a slow response by the Forests Ministry for the fire getting out of hand.</p><p>Across the road from Appel's home, Duncan MacInnes is working at an excavation company that was mostly spared by the fire, even though it's only a few hundred metres from the sawmill that was essentially vaporized in temperatures some have estimated would have reached about 4,000 degrees.</p><p>He too has no bitterness toward Barre, even though his boss lost about $300,000 worth of equipment, none of it insured.</p><p>\"Everybody makes mistakes,'' says MacInnes. \"He admitted to dropping the cigarette.</p><p>\"It was a problem waiting to happen. The government creates the problem by leaving the fuels on the ground. Forest fires are natural things. They are supposed to happen.''</p><p>In finding him guilty of dropping a burning substance in or within one kilometre of a forest, Judge William Sundhu decided that Barre \"was not paying attention'' when he stomped out his cigarette.</p><p>\"The evidence strongly leans to the conclusion that Mr. Barre was not paying attention . . . and failed to direct his mind to the importance of discarding and putting out his cigarette in an appropriate place and manner,'' the judge said in his written ruling.</p><p>The judge said Barre's initial statements to authorities immediately after the blaze, in which he took responsibility for the fire, differed from his testimony in court, where he said he had butted the cigarette out properly.</p><p>\"I do not believe him and the manner in which he claims to have put out the cigarette,'' the judge said. \"He did not take reasonable care in putting out his cigarette.''</p><p>Cherry Dionne is serving coffee at the rustic McLure Cafe, close to where the fire began.</p><p>\"It was an accident and things like that happen all the time,'' says Dionne, who signed the petition. \"He's just a normal country bumpkin.''</p><p>One of Dionne's customers, Reg Tucker, has just finished breakfast and is en route to his home in Edmonton when he weighs in.</p><p>\"My heart goes out to the guy because he was so honest. The man was being honest and they punish him for that.''</p><p>In Barriere, which was spared for the most part the devastation wrought on Louis Creek and McLure, Karen Peterson is asked if there is anyone she knows who feels anger towards Barre.</p><p>\"I haven't met anybody,'' says Peterson who is not the first to say that the case did not need to go to court.</p><p>\"What is the point of spending more money chasing this through the courts?'' she asks.</p><p>Peterson set up the petition in her Country Feeds store and it was also passed around in restaurants in the area.</p><p>\"I think he has suffered enough. He was honest about his mistake.''</p><p>When she says the fire could have been started by anybody, she backs it up.</p><p>In the days following the fire, when residents spent a lot of time in their cars at roadblocks, waiting to get back to their homes, \"I saw people flicking cigarettes out of their windows and I thought, 'You could have started it.'''</p><p>Lost in all the attention focused on the fire and Barre, was the work afterwards of the Mennonites, who supplied free labour, and the organizers of the North Thompson Relief Fund, says Appel.</p><p>His house was uninsured and he got $45,000 from the fund and another $5,000 from the province for his business losses to rebuild on the same spot.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20051108CPCPG8592</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4HHM-6YF0-01G6-9019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>November 8, 2005 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>MCLURE CAFE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>JUSTICE; ENVIRONMENT; FORESTRY; POLITICS;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A4JU</classCode><className>CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001796</classCode><className>VERDICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001317</classCode><className>PETITIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
