The next day it was 100 hectares in size. By the time Parry Sound 33 was considered under control, and then out on Oct. 31, 11,362 hectares were burnt leaving behind memories of Key River, French River and Henvey Inlet residents' evacuations and lost homes, plus lost tourism business for those on its border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During Parry Sound 33, Britt was the command centre for firefighters and its department's members helped in the evacuations.</p><p>\"With our emergency preparedness plan, it was a good working exercise. There were things we might have changed but we had a chance to exercise it and for all intents and purposes it went really well,\" said Britt fire chief Larry Olds.</p><p>The department is working to revamp the plan, based on lessons learned, to layout clear steps ahead of declaring a state of emergency. A state of emergency wasn't declared in Britt.</p><p>Parry Sound 33 has changed how some are approaching burning.</p><p>\"People still have (the fire) on the back of their minds,\" said Olds. \"I'm getting more phone calls this year: 'can we burn or should we burn?' They're more conscience now of burning than they were before...especially when they realize the cost of burning, if it gets out of hand that they could be on the hook for.\"</p><p>The fire had Bear Claw Tours business down 45 per cent from 2017 with people thinking it was in Parry Sound, the town. The good news is that so far his May to November season is starting off on the right foot, despite flooding in Muskoka that has his customers concerned trails here may be under water.</p><p>\"First of all I have to dig myself out of the 45 per cent hole,\" said owner Andrew Ryeland. \"That means paying back (debt), but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to do that. Unless something else happens, we should be fine.\"</p><p>If there is a forest fire in the District of Parry Sound of similar magnitude, he hopes it's named differently. Parry Sound 33 was the 33rd fire in Parry Sound District but it was confused with the Town of Parry Sound, a situation exasperated when a Toronto television show falsely reported Parry Sound was being evacuated.</p><p>In Ontario, the forest fire season starts in April.</p><p>In April 2018 the Parry Sound area had 90 mm of rain, 38.5 mm in May, 39.3mm in June and 7.3 mm in July. This year, there was 131.1 mm in April and on May 9, the forecast was up to 60 mm of rain.</p><p>Environment Canada weather preparedness meteorologist Peter Kimbell said there's no way of knowing if conditions will change and be closer to those of last year.</p><p>\"I looked at the forecast for the summer, and really there's no signal,\" said Kimbell. \"It could be anything.\"</p><p>Last year there were 1,300 forest fires in Ontario. Prior to that the 10-year average was 757. This year the first forest fire in this district, Parry Sound 1, was April 17.</p><p>The Forest Fire Info Map shows Parry Sound 1 was across the railway tracks that had been a line in the sand for those battling Parry Sound 33, and it was human caused.</p><p>\"The amount and timing of precipitation is obviously the biggest factor that we see,\" said spokesperson Shayne McCool of the forest fire season. \"When we see a long period without significant rain the vegetation has an opportunity to dry out and it can become more susceptible to fires.\"</p><p>Between April 2018 and March 2019 the province spent $212 million on fighting forest fires and brought in help from the U.S. and Mexico. The base budget this year is $69.8 million. Last month that difference had critics claiming the province had slashed funding.</p><p>\"There have actually been no cuts to the forest fire fighting funding. Each year Ontario provides about $70 million to support the front line efforts of fighting forest fires. That funding is reevaluated by the Ontario government as the season unfolds,\" said McCool.</p><p>To help cut down the number of fires humans cause the public is reminded to never leave a camp fire unattended and ensure it's completely out.</p><p>The cause of Parry Sound 33 was given as a disabled vehicle. No charges under the Forest Fires Prevention Act were laid.</p><p>Sidebar:</p><p>Story behind the story</p><p>Last year's massive fire took the community by storm. Could it happen again? With summer 2019 just around the corner our reporter's mind turned what could be ahead of us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2019051054389810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W47-BJ31-JDH1-C3PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

No injuries had been reported.</p><p>Mayor Vic Power declared a state of emergency due to conditions of the forest fire which hit the townships of Ogden and Mountjoy.</p><p>More evacuations were expected as the fire headed north.</p><p>The evacuees were taken to the McIntyre Community Centre and were expected to stay with friends or find a hotel room for the night.</p><p>\"They won't be going back,'' said Legouffe.</p><p>Legouffe said the fire was threatening to destroy the two trailer parks and a heavily built up area containing many homes and cottages.</p><p>Burning along a 200 hectare front, the fire jumped the 120-metre wide Mattagami River and was headed for the city.</p><p>\"It's burning right alongside two of our major saw mills, one of them has a $7-million woodpile and if that went up would burn like a blast furnace,'' said Legouffe.</p><p>\"It's still a danger because the wind keeps shifting and there's a lot of smoke which makes it hard to get a view of what's going on.</p><p>\"The fire has been throwing flames ahead and starting new fires.''</p><p>He said three water bombers had been brought in to help quell the flames and eight crews from local fire departments and Ministry fire crews were working on the ground.</p><p>\"Timmins fire crews, they're using about everything they have.''</p><p>It's the first forest fire of the season in the area but Legouffe said the fires don't usually burn so close to the city.</p><p>Highway 101 West was closed soon after the fire broke out.</p><p>Just a year ago, residents along the Mattagami River battled the worst flooding in more than 20 years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199705290238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4706-36C0-01G6-84M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 29, 1997 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CY7S</classCode><className>TRAILER PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Janet and Bill Hoskins at the University's Institute of Industrial Mathematical Sciences.\u00a0\u00a0The $ 70,000 project is funded by the Canada-Manitoba Partnership Agreement in Forestry.\u00a0\u00a0The Hoskins expect to have a prototype system completed by June 1992, which will introduce operational fire suppression staff to Forestry Canada's Canadian Forest Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System, a complex computer model that uses weather, forest type and topographic information to predict such elements as how fast a fire spreads, its intensity, size and shape.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Recent statistics stress the importance of this initiative,\" noted federal Forestry Minister Frank Oberle, adding \"In 1989, Manitoba experienced a record loss of over three million hectares of forest, and across Canada each year, about 2.5 million hectares of forest are destroyed, incurring fire management costs of almost $ 275 million.\"\u00a0\u00a0He indicated that the software will be used by fire management agencies not only across Canada, but in other countries such as the United States, New Zealand, Fiji and Greece, who also use Forestry Canada's Fire Behaviour Prediction System.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prototype hypertext system will enable users to combine text, graphics and other media, such as videos, to give users greater flexibility than earlier data base systems.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hypertext is curiosity driven\", explains Dr. Janet Hoskins.\u00a0\u00a0\"Information is cross-linked or layered so that users can access related material in a non-sequential manner.\u00a0\u00a0For example, a user can shift instantly from technical data to picture or mathematical formulas or definitions, following a line of thought through to completion.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kelvin Hirsch, a Fire Research Officer with Forestry Canada, believes the training package is an excellent initiative, since predicting fire behaviour is both a science and an art that requires a great deal of skill and knowledge.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fire behaviour prediction is heavily dependent upon an individual's experience and understanding of the basic principles of fire behaviour\", says Hirsch.\u00a0\u00a0\"Since no model or system can ever account for all the variables that could affect a fire's behaviour, the fire manager must still rely on his or her own ability to cope with unique and unusual situations.\u00a0\u00a0The best possible fire behaviour predictions are those that are based on the systematically calculated values of the Forest Fire Behaviour Prediction System in combination with the opinions and assessments of experienced fire management personnel.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A complete software package should be available by December 1993.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/For\u00a0 further information:\u00a0\u00a0Doug Pronger, (204) 983-7031/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW1992</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SKM-YHS0-0054-1424-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1992 Canada NewsWire Ltd.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"06\" day=\"04\" year=\"1992\"><dateText>June 4, 1992, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FORESTRY CANADA\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Forestry Canada \u00a0FORESTRY CANADA\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Forestry Canada \u00a0FORESTRY CANADA\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp;

The purpose of a steadily rising price on carbon pollution is to make carbon-intensive goods more expensive than alternatives and to spur innovation.</p><p>Carbon taxes don't need to grow government coffers - for example, with carbon fee and dividend the revenue is returned to households as a dividend to help offset the rising costs.</p><p>Addressing climate change is a long-term project - one that will likely continue for all our lives. Increasing BC's carbon tax is one way to do our fair share to rapidly reduce carbon pollution worldwide so that hopefully we can avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.</p><p>As our climate warms, the risk of devastating forest fires keeps increasing because higher temperatures and prolonged summer droughts dry out our forests. Governments are working hard to find measures to prevent and manage these long and intense fire seasons. Besides increased forest fires, climate change brings more extreme weather events causing more floods and landslides - like we had across the province this spring.</p><p>Sadly, climate change is real and happening now. The well reputed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) just announced that this year's global temperature for January to June was the second warmest on record, surprising many scientists because this is not an El Ni\u00f1o year, like last year, when global temperatures tend to be higher.</p><p>The current fire situation is of grave concern to many of us here in British Columbia.</p><p>It will continue to get worse as years go by if we keep polarizing the issue instead of addressing its root cause - our carbon pollution.</p><p>My heart goes out to the thousands of fellow British Columbians impacted by these fires and to the fire fighters who work tirelessly to save our homes.</p><p>Laura Sacks</p><p>Castlegar, BC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCOU-3404800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCOU2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P43-CN31-JDH3-G440-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Caledonia Courier (Fort St. James)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS4K</classCode><className>CARBON TAX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

McCool said this has been a landmark year for forest fires in Ontario, mostly due to lots of lightning and precious little rain.</p><p>\"When that occurs and forest fields are as dry as they are, when lightning strikes, it ignites a lot easier than maybe it would when fields are more wet or damp,\" he said.</p><p>There have been 831 wildfires this year so far, compared to an annual average of 511 over the past 10 years.</p><p>The ministry said there were 39 active fires in northeastern Ontario on Monday afternoon and more than 100 in the northwest region. Of those, 44 fires were still raging out of control.</p><p>A firefighter from Alberta died on Thursday while fighting a fire near the town of Red Lake, Ont., about 100 kilometres east of the Manitoba boundary.

McCool said this has been a landmark year for forest fires in Ontario, mostly due to lots of lightning and precious little rain.</p><p>\"When that occurs and forest fields are as dry as they are, when lightning strikes it ignites a lot easier than maybe it would when fields are more wet or damp,\" he said.</p><p>There have been 831 wildfires this year so far, compared to an annual average of 511 over the past 10 years.</p><p>The ministry said there were 39 active fires in northeastern Ontario on Monday afternoon and more than 100 in the northwest region. Of those, 44 fires were still raging out of control.</p><p>A firefighter from Alberta died on Thursday while fighting a fire near the town of Red Lake, Ont., about 100 kilometres east of the Manitoba boundary. He was identified as Jerry Gadwa, a resident of Kehewin Cree Nation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-07/30/201846994135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXJ-KXV1-JDH3-G34C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It was the deadliest fire in Israel's history, according to rescue workers, who struggled to contain flames that raged late into the night.</p><p>Most of those killed were guards, who were racing across the north to help evacuate a low-security jail that held Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The bus was travelling along a mountain road when flames suddenly surrounded it, rescue workers said.</p><p>The bus driver was unable to avoid the blaze, which was spreading at a rate of more than 160 km/h, firefighters said. When the bus swerved off the road, it was caught in an inferno. All the prison guards were killed immediately, Israeli medics said.</p><p>\"Anyone who's ever seen a firestorm will know. They could not survive it. They had no protection; they just fell to the road and burned alive,\" firefighter Dudu Vanunu said.</p><p>A police chief and several officers who were driving next to the bus were wounded. They were hospitalized and listed in critical condition Thursday evening, medics said.</p><p>The prison, which held about 500 Palestinians, later was evacuated safely.</p><p>\"This is a disaster of unprecedented proportions,\" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who went to northern Israel on Thursday night to visit colleagues of the dead guards.</p><p>Israel celebrated the second night of Hanukkah on Thursday, a holiday known as the \"festival of lights\" for a legendary miracle in which one can of olive oil was used to light the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem for eight days.</p><p>Netanyahu declared a state of national emergency and dispatched every firefighting team in the country to fight the blaze.</p><p>At least 2,000 acres had burned through Thursday night.</p><p>Israel is suffering through one of the worst droughts in 60 years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUMERC-14969942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUMERC2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51M5-C3X1-JCBF-537K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247361</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"315\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Metroland Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Guelph Mercury (Ontario, Canada)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>December 3, 2010 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000409</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001930</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922140GC</classCode><className>PRISONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009XU6</classCode><className>HANUKKAH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp;

(CP) - A forest fire just north of this northern oil city threatened the region's power supply as it burned out of control Thursday.</p><p>\"The forest fires in the Fort McMurray area are threatening two of our large transmission lines that feed the area,'' said Elaine Sagan of ATCO Electric.</p><p>-BODY- \"However, at this time both are still in service,'' she said Thursday afternoon.</p><p>There were a number of fires burning near Fort McMurray Thursday, three out of control. None were threatening the town.</p><p>Earlier, one of the blazes just north of town went through an area where ATCO has three smaller transmission lines and damaged one of them, knocking it out of service, Sagan said. The other two lines were still in operation.</p><p>The damage caused surges and fluctuations in the city's power supply, she said.

Its 2,000 residents had to take turns squeezing into small boats and make the 20-minute journey across Island Lake to St. Theresa Point. The effort continued well into the night.</p><p>\"We were covered in pine needles, embers. And it just turned dark,\" McDougall said. Small lights were used on the boats to guide the evacuees safely across the water.</p><p>Over the next 36 hours or so, many of the evacuees would go on from St. Theresa Point to Garden Hill, where military transport planes can land. From there they were taken to hotel rooms or large emergency shelters more than 500 kilometres south in Winnipeg and Brandon.</p><p>One woman had a miscarriage during the trek, McDougall said, and another died of diabetes-related complications after she fled south. Two evacuees in Brandon were hospitalized with pneumonia related to smoke inhalation.</p><p>McDougall and other Indigenous leaders called a news conference Wednesday to demand an airport for Wasagamack - something they said governments promised more than 50 years ago.</p><p>\"They deserve infrastructure that keep their people safe,\" said Sheila North Wilson, grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents First Nations communities across northern Manitoba.</p><p>\"In this day and age, it's not acceptable for them to have to leave ... the way they did.\"</p><p>More than 5,000 people in total were forced to flee Wasagamack, Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point. More than 1,000 were put up in two large emergency shelters - one in the Winnipeg Convention Centre and another at an indoor soccer complex.</p><p>The Canadian Red Cross, which is managing the evacuations for the federal government, said Wednesday it no longer needed the convention centre because more hotel rooms in the city have become available with the end of the summer tourist season.</p><p>Some evacuees also found lodging with friends or relatives.</p><p>\"Less than 375 evacuees stayed at the two shelters (Tuesday) night, with less than 125 at the convention centre,\" the agency said in a written statement.</p><p>\"The remaining evacuees will either move to the soccer complex shelter or to hotel rooms that become available.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, health officials said one confirmed case of mumps has surfaced in an evacuee in a shelter in Brandon.</p><p>Dr. Richard Rusk, provincial medical officer of health for communicable diseases, said there are four more suspected cases among evacuees in Winnipeg.</p><p>Evacuees showing symptoms are being moved to local hotels to help stop the illness from spreading.</p><p>A different fire near the Poplar River First Nation improved this week, which has allowed about 750 people to start returning to their homes. That has also opened up hotel space.</p><p>-- with files from CTV Winnipeg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f8360b39ee6d4560ba81a7a2b7c4b9e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PDW-TWV1-DY9S-T46B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><timeReceived>10:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 6, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(CP) - Firefighter Martin Pell calls himself \"one mad soldier'' fighting a vicious battle against nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When it gets this bad, Mother Nature calls the shots and she's firing a helluva lot more bullets than we can take,'' said Pell, glaring angrily at billows of white smoke from a Twin Otter flying about 1,200 metres over burning northwestern Ontario forestland.</p><p>The back of his orange coveralls bear the words Fire Control. But Pell, 49, admits the 1,000 firefighters who have advanced into northwestern Ontario can only wish they had control over the area's more than 220 fires.</p><p>Fires have claimed 1,300 square kilometres of forestland. Many call them the worst fires to scar the region in 15 years.</p><p>The war is being fought with 10 water bombers, eight fixed-wing aircraft and more than 60 helicopters.</p><p>They're getting orders from a military-style command post - the fire response centre in Dryden, Ont., about 200 kilometres south of Red Lake.</p><p>\"It's like a war game,'' said Rob Rutherford, the 40-year-old command officer who's spending 16-hour days at the centre next to the town's airport.</p><p>\"You're trying to position yourself against the enemy. In our case, it's these fires,'' he said, casting his eyes over wall-sized maps covered with arrows and dots charting the course of fires, water bombers and fire crews engaged in the battle.</p><p>\"It's stress with a big S. This just keeps building and building and building,'' added Ed Bons, one of a handful of ministry workers crowding the tiny fire response centre.</p><p>Bons helps decide where each water bomber and fire crew will go. Other fire intelligence officers worked their computer terminals to track weather and burning conditions as well as possible fire hazards, mapping out a plan of attack.</p><p>But the soldiers can't keep ahead of the enemy. Mother Nature has been a relentless foe.</p><p>Temperatures have reached 40C, lightning strikes nightly and there's no rain in sight. It's been that way for three weeks and forecasts predict little change, said Debbie MacLean, a spokeswoman for Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources.</p><p>While no one has died, the blazes have forced about 1,500 natives to become refugees. Six settlements have been forced to flee to safety.</p><p>Exhausted firefighters are wilting under the heat of battle.</p><p>As Pell soars over the skies on his way from Dryden to Red Lake to fight a blaze, he said he's determined his side will triumph soon.</p><p>\"We aren't giving up, no way.

MARIE - The 1995 forest fire season in Ontario cost the natural resources ministry more than $101 million, making it one of the most costly ever.</p><p>Bob Thomas of the ministry's Aviation and Fire Management Centre, based in Sault Ste. Marie, says 2,118 fires burned over 620,000 hectares of forest and forced close to 3,500 people to flee their homes and communities.</p><p>The forest fire season runs from April 1 to Oct. 30.</p><p>Thomas says it's difficult to compare fires on a year-to-year basis because of the many factors involved. For example, there were more fires - 2,560 in 1991, with only 318,000 hectares of forest burned. That's almost one-half this year's tally.</p><p>The most serious fires were near the lumbering community of Dubreuilville, 280 kilometres north of Sault Ste. Marie. The 1,200 residents of the community were forced to flee to nearby Wawa, White River and Sault Ste. Marie as the flames approached to within a few kilometres of the town.</p><p>The residents were evacuated Aug. 21 and returned a week later after firefighters beat back the flames and saved the town.</p><p>It was a dramatic fire season, says Thomas.</p><p>\"In the twenties, forest fires destroyed over 800,000 hectares of forest, but they were not able to map the burned-out areas like we can today so it's difficult to compare.\"</p><p>In 1994 there were just over 1,000 forest fires, destroying 83,000 hectares and costing the province $12 million.</p><p>Two thousand firefighters from other parts of Canada and the United States were brought in to help the 750 firefighters hired for the summer by the ministry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR1995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3WFV-5080-00H1-P41P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"269\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"11\" day=\"15\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>November 15, 1995, Wednesday, METRO EDITION</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SAULT STE MARIE BRIDGE CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SAULT STE MARIE BRIDGE CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D1NZ</classCode><className>SAULT STE MARIE, MI, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Of these, 17 are not yet under control, 38 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">River Valley Fire Cluster</p><p>The River Valley Fire Cluster includes two fires: North Bay 62 and North Bay 42. Both fires are now being held. North Bay 25 is being monitored.</p><p>There are 138 people working on these fires including firefighters from Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Mexico.</p><p>Fire behavior was relatively quiet Tuesday, July 24, due to the rain, increased cloud cover and higher humidity levels. Fires received about 50 millimetres of precipitation over the past 48 hours.</p><p>Temagami Fire Cluster:</p><p>There are 45 firefighters, with six helicopters working on fires in the Temagami cluster.</p><p>Due to the rain received in the area, fire activity was greatly reduced on all fires within the Temagami cluster. These conditions made for another great working day for firefighters, as they are able to get into hot spot areas safely.</p><p>Lady Evelyn Fire Cluster:</p><p>The Lady Evelyn Fire Cluster remains at 27,579 hectares, with 253 firefighters and support staff, and 11 helicopters assigned to this cluster. All resources were assigned to North Bay 72 today. The team continues to observe North Bay 59 and has assumed the responsibility for North Bay fires 18, 19, 46, 59 and 61.</p><p>Restricted Fire Zone expanded</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, July 24, and remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25 and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25 and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris, is restricted.

At this residence, the flames consumed just about everything except the fireplace.</p><p>CPL. JOE TAPLIN (RCMP): Right now there's roughly 13 homes or outbuildings that have been damaged and two of them have been burnt to the ground.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: Destroyed by a fire that is getting smaller, now about five kilometres long and a kilometre wide.</p><p>ROY HOLLETT (Halifax Regional Fire Department): I heard from the crews it's hot, dusty, very smoky.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: And what's making it more difficult than usual to fight is that this was an area ravaged by hurricane Juan five years ago. And go for a walk in the forest here and this is what you'll see, tens of thousands of dead, fallen trees that just were never cleared out. Firefighters say it's like a giant pile of dry kindling. All that dead wood from toppled trees fueling the flames.</p><p>PETER MACISAAC (Dept. of Natural Resources): It's what we call a very heavy fuel load, and it's extremely difficult fuel to deal with.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: As for how the fire started, police think they know, but aren't saying. And outside a shelter, anxious evacuees waited all day for word about their homes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Our house is fine, and I cried happy tears.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: And then came the news everyone was waiting for, fire officials deciding most neighbourhoods were safe enough to return to. Thousands of residents could go home.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Glad to be going back home and the home is still there.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: But about 50 people will be kept out for another night. Firefighters saying with this one they are almost, but not completely out of the woods just yet.

As a resident of 108 Mile Ranch who was evacuated for 15 days, and a professional counsellor who is seeing a sharp increase in clients with stress related disorders and depression, I believe that your article inaccurately misrepresents the devastation of our wildfires.</p><p>The tone of your article is that- \"it's no big deal; not much damage to see.\" How disrespectful to the thousands of residents who have been displaced and the hundreds who have lost homes, outbuildings, businesses, livestock, etc., etc.</p><p>You said you drove from Highway 24 onto Highway 97 through to Prince George. How did you miss three kilometres of burned forest from Canim Hendrix Road just north of 100 Mile House through to 105 Mile? If you had taken a moment to drive in this area and two to three km off 105 Mile Road West and Tatton Station Road, you would have seen total devastation of forest and many homes! It would have left you numb and heart sick as it did when we drove through.</p><p>You say that \"the only visible scars...[around] Williams Lake\" was \"where a brush fire ran up to one of the many widening and paving projects...and the construction area acted as a firebreak and only a small spot burned...\" Are you kidding me? Did you not see the miles of burned forest that ran along the highway and into the Sugar Cane Reserve? If you had taken just another moment to drive up the road to Horsefly, you would have seen burned forest, a burned home, and near loss of the 153 Mile log home building plant for Pioneer Log Homes (aka The Timber Kings TV reality show).</p><p>And, I'm only referring to my immediate area from 100 Mile to Williams Lake. You should take a drive and see the devastation from Ashcroft through to Clinton on Highway 97. It is sickening.</p><p>Also in your editorial, you cite some very inaccurate statistics about the history of wildfires. If you listened to the news reports from Aug. 16, you would have learned that the 2017 wildfire season has already surpassed the 1958 record year, and we are far from being out of the woods with many remaining weeks of hot, dry weather and potential lightning storms. This has been, and will be by far and away, the most destructive wildfire season in B.C. history!</p><p>I would like to see you print an apology to the citizens of British Columbia (especially those of us directly affected), as well as correct your statistics.</p><p>We are going to need many months and years of financial support to help us rebuild our lives and businesses; unfortunately, an article such as yours makes it look like it's all been media hyperbole and that intelligent people shouldn't be buying into the spin. Shameful and hurtful.</p><p>Debbie Hancock</p><p>Certified Canadian Counsellor</p><p>108 Mile Ranch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-3422492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PB8-HMV1-F105-649F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>100 Mile House Free Press</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 25, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLFX</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DF2W</classCode><className>NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N236100CC</classCode><className>RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DF2W</classCode><className>NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009QWH</classCode><className>REALITY TELEVISION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Forests Ministry says although its review largely confirmed the account gleaned from the audio recordings, it also indicates the response by provincial firefighters was appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p>\"An initial review by all responding agencies shows an excellent co-ordinated response. The ministry has received numerous compliments for its fast response to this fire,\" the ministry said in a fact sheet released this week.</p><p>\"Given the aggressive behaviour of this wildfire, public and first responder safety was of paramount importance. No injuries were reported during this incident.\"</p><p>The fire was first reported at 2:55 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 9, and emergency officials quickly confirmed it was just outside the jurisdiction of Peachland's volunteer fire department, leaving the initial response to the provincial wildfire management branch.</p><p>A forest officer was in a truck driving to the scene by 3:10, according to the ministry timeline.</p><p>By 3:22, about 27 minutes after the fire was first reported, the first water-dropping helicopter was in the air and en route. The chopper's travel time to the fire was estimated to be about five minutes.</p><p>At roughly the same time, a duty officer with the Peachland Fire Department responded.</p><p>The forest officer requested Peachland's help at 3:27, and the two vehicles from the department were dispatched within minutes. The first Peachland Fire Department member was on the scene at 3:34, according to the ministry - 39 minutes after the fire was first reported.</p><p>Meanwhile, the fire was growing rapidly in strong winds..</p><p>The fire moved one kilometre in just half an hour - or 33 metres every minute, according to the ministry fact sheet.</p><p>At one point, sparks and embers capable of starting smaller fires - a process known as spotting - were being carried up to 500 metres ahead of the main fire.</p><p>At 3:59 p.m., a bird-dog plane, which makes observations and directs air tankers carrying fire retardant, flew overhead. An air tanker dropped the first load of fire retardant at 4:16, according to the ministry.</p><p>The ministry said it would also conduct a full review into the response, as it does with all significant fires.</p><p>Neither the provincial wildfire management branch nor the Peachland Fire Department have targets for response times.</p><p>The Forests Ministry said such guidelines aren't practical for provincial firefighters because of the size of the province. Instead, the ministry noted 92 per cent of all wildfires are contained before they reach four hectares.</p><p>The Peachland Fire Department, which required a request from the province before leaving its own boundaries, also said response time targets don't make sense, because response times often depend on where volunteers are when a fire breaks out and how quickly they can reach the fire hall before responding.</p><p>The ministry fact sheet noted the wildfire management branch has an agreement with Emergency Management B.C. to co-ordinate responses when fires are near populated areas. In such cases, a response that involves multiple agencies is handled through a \"unified command structure,\" which was put into action in the Peachland fire.</p><p>The ministry noted that agreement allows municipal fire departments to respond to fires outside of their jurisdiction if requested by the wildfire management branch.</p><p>The Peachland fire started about two kilometres up the road from the end of the Peachland Fire Department's jurisdiction.</p><p>Elsie Lemke, chief administrative officer with the District of Peachland, said a major issue in such cases is insurance, including personal and corporate liability and workers' compensation.</p><p>\"We're covered for responding to fires or other emergencies within our boundaries,\" said Lemke.</p><p>\"The only time we're covered to go outside out boundaries is when we're called by the appropriate organization that has the right to request us or when a neighbouring community calls and asks for our help when it's under a mutual aid (agreement).\"</p><p>There are a number of homes and acreages along the road between the district and where the fire started, near a park on the side of Highway 97C.</p><p>Lemke noted in 2010 the Regional District of Central Okanagan planned to explore the possibility of funding fire protection in the valley.</p><p>When the regional district asked the province for help in paying for such a study, the government said its grant funding had been used up for the year. Lemke said Peachland has not heard anything further about the issue since then.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">B75C0063277742088E7D812780638565</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56KV-R2X1-JBVR-30RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2013-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>September 18, 2012 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
