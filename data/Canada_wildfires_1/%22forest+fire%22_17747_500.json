And it's something used worldwide to monitor air pollution.</p><p>According to Public Health Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment set up a network of fixed-site air quality monitoring stations in municipalities around the province around 2003.</p><p>They were looking for different substances in the air.</p><p>Air pollutants</p><p>There are three main air pollutants the government is testing for air quality.</p><p>Fine particulate matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter is small particles of solids and aerosols mixed together, which can include metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the Earth. Scientifically known as PM2.5, they are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.</p><p>Sources include burning gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood.</p><p>\"Those are things from forest fire or wildfire smoke, they are very fine particles in the atmosphere that can be irritants to the general public, especially those with pre-existing health conditions,\" said Steven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.   </p><p>That's what we're seeing in higher volumes this week, as uncontrolled wildfires burn in the prairies and northern Ontario.</p><p>Ground-level ozone</p><p>The second substance is ozone, known as O3, and we typically see higher levels in the springtime, before tree leaves come out.</p><p>\"It looks for ozone at the surface level. We hear about ozone in the upper atmosphere, which is helpful to protect from solar radiation,\" Flisfeder said. \"Once it reaches the surface level, it can cause adverse health effects.\"</p><p>Nitrous dioxide</p><p>The AQHI also looks for nitrous dioxide, or NO2, which is essentially car exhaust.</p><p>\"We've been seeing them stay below our threshold that would trigger an air quality statement,\" Flisfeder said. \"We tend to see a spike in nitrous dioxide during the rush hour when more people are out on the roads, but if the atmosphere is in a state where those (fumes) are able to rise and dissipate, they won't get to a concentration that would warrant an air quality statement.\"</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Health Canada estimates that above-background air pollution, including air pollution from human sources in North America, contributes to 15,300 premature deaths per year in Canada.</p><p>In fact, air pollution is the fifth leading mortality risk in the world, according to the Global Burden of Disease project.</p><p>Back in 2016, Health Canada said the total economic cost of all health impacts - attributable to air pollution for the year - was estimated at $120 billion.</p><p>Exposure to any of these air pollutants can cause coughing and sore or scratchy throat, make it more difficult to take a deep breath. It may cause wheezing or can be painful when taking a deep breath. It can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.</p><p>Fatal symptoms from prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter can include bronchitis, asthma and cardiac arrest, Health Canada noted.</p><p>\"Both (O3 and NO2) gases are relatively water insoluble and reach lower into the respiratory tract, where they can cause airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, lung injury, and impaired host defence,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>A fourth air pollutant that can also be measured - but is not part of the AQHI - is sulphur dioxide, SO2, which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Controlled human exposure studies show clear relationship between inhalation of high concentrations of SO2 and increased airway resistance in asthmatics, and in healthy normal volunteers,\" Public Health Ontario said.</p><p>AQHI levels</p><p>The AQHI scale is now based on levels from one to 10-plus, with health messages and displayed graphically for each warning level.</p><p>The AQHI was first introduced in 2008 and rolled out across Canada in 2016.</p><p>\"It was introduced as a way to emphasize the deteriorating health implications that can come from poor air quality.\"</p><p>Levels one to three are within normal range - no caution is needed. They are colour-coded with blue colours.</p><p>Levels four to six mean there's a moderate risk. For those with asthma or chronic health issues, they may notice a change with breathing when outdoors. They are colour-coded in yellow and orange, to show there's a caution.</p><p>\"You don't really need to modify your daily activities, but if you start experience systems, such as coughing or sore throat, then take preventive action,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>Head indoors, close your windows, and stop any strenuous outdoor activity, he added.</p><p>Levels seven to 10 are high risk, and are marked with shades of red.</p><p>\"That's where everybody should start to consider reducing or rescheduling their outdoor activities. It's not just about waiting to see if you have these outdoor irritations,\" he said.</p><p>The final, 10-plus level is considered very high risk, a dark red or maroon colour is used for this level, and everyone may experience side effects from the poor air quality.</p><p>Each individual pollutant has a safe range, and if any one is elevated, Environment Canada meteorologists can issue an air quality alert.</p><p>\"Right now we have forest fire smoke that is reaching the surface in high concentrations,\" Flisfeder said. \"Fine particulate matter - what we refer to as PM2.5 - when those concentrations reach at least 60 microns, which is micrograms per metre cubed, it automatically forces our hand to issue an air quality statement.\"</p><p>However, there's also a formula that checks the cumulative effects of all three pollutants, which can also trigger an alert.</p><p>Atmospheric levels</p><p>For humans to be impacted by the air pollution, it has to be within breathing level.</p><p>Meteorologists use the term surface level when monitoring AQHI.</p><p>\"In meteorology, we refer to surface level as the lowest levels of the atmosphere. So anywhere from the ground we walk on or the waters, up to a few hundred meters that can be low enough that it affects air quality.\"</p><p>Already this year, wildfire smoke has drifted southward, but it's been so high up in the atmosphere that it hasn't impacted the air we breathe, and no alerts were issued.</p><p>\"When it's higher up in the atmosphere, you can still see the effects, but it doesn't have any health affects for most people. You can see the hazy skies at sunset and sunrise. You see a red sun instead of a typical orange or yellow sun. That can help indicate smoke is present in the atmosphere but it's not making its way low enough to impact general health.\"</p><p>Winds of change</p><p>It is interesting to see how far the winds carry forest fire smoke, which can impact us in Ontario from several provinces away.</p><p>\"All that smoke becomes concentrated in the atmosphere at varying levels, so it's not all at surface level,\" Flisfeder said. \"As the winds push it east or west or north or south - wherever it happens to go - those concentrations change at different places. It can travel across the country. It can go all the way across the world as well.\"</p><p>And because some of that smoke is already in the atmosphere, if all of the forest fires were put out tomorrow, we could still see residual effects for a few days.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be an expert on that, there are dissipation models run on a regular basis. Typically speaking, if the fires were put out tomorrow, the concentrations already in the atmosphere would have to go through their life cycle,\" Flisfeder said. \"It can last in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>The likelihood you might smell smoke from wildfires elsewhere all depends on the concentration of particles, Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"The higher the concentration, that would relate to a higher AQHI number. But also, the more smoke is actually in the lower atmosphere, it's more likely you will smell it.\"</p><p>The role of rain</p><p>What could help the situation is rainfall, but it's not a guarantee.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily true that rain will clear the air,\" Flisfeder said. \"It could be pushing the pollutants further down (to surface level). On the other hand, it could also be washing it out.\"</p><p>Rain is, however, a potential filter factor for the AQHI.</p><p>Will air quality alerts continue this summer?</p><p>\"As long as forest fires continues, there will be the potential for more air quality statements. But it all depends on how the winds blow.\"</p><p>For now, the winds are still blowing the smoke to the south, and people should watch the AQHI alerts on weather.gc.ca or on the WeatherCAN app.</p><p>There's also a world air quality index map that you can explore, to see what other impacts are happening across the globe, at waqi.info. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025060775745848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCF-DMG3-S881-40JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

TARIFFS</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KATIE SIMPSON(NEWSCASTER):<br/><br/>   KATIE: TWO MAJOR WILDFIRES ARE STILL BURNING OUT OF CONTROL IN NEW BRUNSWICK.<br/>ONE FIRE IS BURNING NEAR MONCTON, THE OTHER NEAR MIRAMACHI.<br/>BOTH ARE MAJOR CITIES IN THE PROVINCE.<br/>WHILE THE TEMPERATURE WARNINGS STILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR MOST OF NEW BRUNSWICK, THERE IS SOME HEAT RELIEF TOMORROW.</p><p><br/>SUSAN HOLT IS THE PREMIER OF NEW BRUNSWICK.<br/>THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CHAT WITH US.<br/>LET'S START WITH WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE GROUND.<br/>   THE LATEST ON THE GROUND IS THAT WE ARE FEELING CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FIRE IN IRISHTOWN.<br/>SO THIS IS NORTH OF MONCTON.<br/>IT'S ABOUT 45 HECTARES IN SIZE.<br/>WE'VE KEPT IT TO THAT SIZE NOW FOR THE LAST DAY OR SO.<br/>AND THE CREWS HAVE GOT, YOU KNOW, RETARDANT BARRIER, A WATER BARRIER.<br/>WE'RE REALLY HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CALL THAT CONTAINED HERE IN THE NEXT DAY.<br/>THE FIRE IN THE MIRAMACHI, THE OLD FIELD ROAD FIRE, THAT WAS OUR FIRST ONE, CONTINUES TO GROW.<br/>IT'S MORE THAN 1300 HECTARES NOW BUT OUR INCREDIBLE CREW OF FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DIRECT IT AT LEAST AWAY FROM PEOPLE AND STRUCTURES.<br/>AND WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THE SHIFT IN WEATHER AND TEMPERATURES AND MAYBE A BIT OF RAIN IS GOING TO COME AND HELP US TURN THE CORNER ON THAT ONE.<br/>   KATIE: DO YOU HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES YOU NEED ON THE GROUND IN THIS MOMENT?<br/>   OH, GOSH.<br/>I MEAN WE -- YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT IS NEVER ENOUGH.<br/>BUT IT DOES GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE WHAT A TEAM EFFORT THIS HAS BEEN.<br/>WE HAVE RECEIVED WATERBOMBERS FROM QUEBEC.<br/>WE'VE RECEIVED FIREFIGHTERS FROM NOVA SCOTIA, FROM P.E.I., FROM THE STATE OF MAINE.<br/>AND WE'VE ALSO SHARED SOME OF OUR RESOURCES WITH NEWFOUNDLAND AND WITH NOVA SCOTIA BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE PRIORIZING PEOPLE AND HOMES AS WE FIGHT FIRES THAT I THINK CANADIANS HAVE BEEN SEEING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY FOR THE LAST MANY MONTHS NOW.<br/>SO WE IN NEW BRUNSWICK ARE USUALLY THE ONES TO LEND OURSELVES OUT.<br/>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE EVER HAD TO ASK FOR HELP.<br/>BUT THANKFULLY HELP HAS BEEN THERE AND WE'VE GOTTEN THE PLANES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO LIVES IN NEW BRUNSWICK THAT HAVE BEEN LOST TO DATE WITH THIS FIREFIGHT.<br/>   KATIE: I RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, IN AN EMERGENCY, THE PRIORITY IS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE, TO TRY AND PROTECT BUSINESSES AND HOMES AND TRY TO CONTAIN THIS FIRE.<br/>BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU LEARNED FROM THE WILDFIRE SEASON THAT REALLY STANDS OUT AS A LEARNING MOMENT THAT THE PROVINCE CAN TAKE AWAY SOMETHING AWAY FROM SO THAT PERHAPS IN YEARS TO COME THERE IS BETTER PREPARATION OR BETTER, YOU KNOW, DEPLOYMENT TO DEAL WITH IT?<br/>   GREAT QUESTION, KATIE.<br/>AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO THE FOLKS WHO CAME BEFORE ME ACTUALLY.<br/>WE HAD A FIRE HERE IN NEW BRUNSWICK ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO AND AFTER THAT, SOME INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN A FEW MORE AIRCRAFT THROUGH FOREST PROTECTION LIMITED.<br/>SOME INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN THE KIND OF STRUCTURE PROTECTION.<br/>INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR FOREST FIRE CENTRE, AND SOME OF THAT -- THOSE INVESTMENTS WERE JUST COMING ONLINE NOW.<br/>WE HAD ORDERED, ACTUALLY, SOME MORE WATERBOMBERS THIS PAST SPRING.<br/>AND THOSE HAVE PROVED TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY HELPFUL.<br/>THE OTHER LEARNING, I THINK, IS THE REGIONAL NATURE OF SOME OF THIS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.<br/>SO THERE'S GOING TO BE GOOD INFORMATIONS FOR PREMIER HOUSTON AND PREMIER LANTZ AND PREMIER HOGAN AND I TO HAVE ABOUT HOW WE BETTER SHARE AND COORDINATE INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES AND SERVICES, ALIGN SOME OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE'RE EACH HELPING EACH OTHER OUT RIGHT NOW AND THAT COULD BE MADE STRONGER AND SMOOTHER IN THE FUTURE.<br/>   KATIE: SO BY CHANCE THIS YEAR, SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES JUST HAPPENED TO COME ONLINE.<br/>DO YOU ANTICIPATE GOING FORWARD GIVEN THE EXTREME WEATHER THAT IS SORT OF NOW MORE AND MORE COMMON AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, DO YOU ANTICIPATE HAVING TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES READY TO GO IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE THESE KINDS OF FIRES?<br/>   YES.<br/>I THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE MORE OF THESE KINDS OF FIRES AND SO -- IT WASN'T BY CHANCE BUT BY FORESIGHT THAT EXPERTS HAD RECOMMENDED THE INVESTMENT IN THOSE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND MAKING SURE WE HAD TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AVAILABLE AND WE WERE ABLE TO LEND THEM OUT TO ONTARIO AND MANITOBA AND OTHER PROVINCES AND THEN THEY WERE HERE WHEN WE NEEDED THEM RIGHT NOW AND SO CONTINUING TO HAVE THAT FORESIGHT THAT WE HAVE A SHIFTING CLIMATE, THAT HOTTER, DRIER TEMPERATURES ARE COMING IN FUTURE YEARS IT MEANS WE CAN TAKE THESE LEARNINGS AND CONTINUE TO INVEST BOTH IN THE ATTACK AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES, BUT ALSO IN OUR CONTINUED EVOLUTION OF FOREST MANAGEMENT AND FOREST PRACTICES HERE IN NEW BRUNSWICK.<br/>   KATIE: NEW BRUNSWICK IS NOT ALONE IN THIS THIS SUMMER, DEALING WITH EXTREME WEATHER AND WILDFIRES.<br/>SOME AMERICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE ACTUALLY COMPLAINED TO THE AMBASSADOR IN THE U.S. AND HAVE COMPLAINED ELSEWHERE ABOUT SMOKE FROM CANADA TRAVELLING ACROSS THE BORDER TO THE UNITED STATES AND CAUSING SMOKEY CONDITIONS.<br/>THEY SAY IT RUINS SUMMERS IN THE U.S.<br/>I'M WONDERING, WERE ANY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS DIRECTED TOWARDS YOU AT ALL SPECIFICALLY?<br/>AND WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO LAWMAKERS WHO ARE MAD ABOUT THE CANADIAN WILDFIRE SMOKE TRAVELLING SOUTH OF THE BORDER?<br/>   WELL, THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME THINGS THAT ARE TRAVELLING NORTH OF THE BORDER THAT I'M MAD ABOUT RIGHT NOW.<br/>BUT OUR PRIORITY IS FOCUSED ON NEW BRUNSWICKERS' LIVES, PROTECTING THEM AND THOSE OF OUR NEIGHBORING PROVINCES.<br/>OF DOING THE RIGHT THING BY THE PEOPLE OF NEW BRUNSWICK AND ACTUALLY BY OUR GOOD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS IN THE STATE OF MAINE WHO HAVE LENT US SOME OF THEIR FOREST -- FIREFIGHTERS, PARDON ME, AND WHERE WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP TO SHARE.<br/>NO.<br/>THE COMPLAINTS FROM THE STATES ABOUT THE SMOKE FROM CANADA IS NOT TOP OF MIND FOR ME RIGHT NOW AS WE FOCUS ON PROTECTING NEW BRUNSWICKERS AND GETTING THESE FIRES OUT.<br/>   KATIE: IF I MAY ASK ON ANOTHER PRESSING ISSUE, I RECOGNIZE THE FIRES ARE TOP OF MIND RIGHT NOW.<br/>BUT YOU'VE BEEN A PART OF THE ONGOING EFFORT TO TRY TO MITIGATE DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFFS.<br/>YOU'VE BEEN PART OF -- ALL OF THE PREMIERS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS.<br/>DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT OR UPDATE ON THE STATE OF THE TALKS, WHERE THEY STAND?<br/>   WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT THAT CERTAINLY FOR THE LAST MANY DAYS MY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE SAFETY OF NEW BRUNSWICKERS.<br/>BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A CURIOUS POSITION RIGHT NOW WITH CANADA HAVING PROBABLY ONE OF THE BETTER SITUATIONS GLOBALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE BEING SIGNED.<br/>BUT WE HAVE A CONSISTENT PRESENCE AND PRESSURE ON THE U.S. TO GET A BETTER DEAL IN PLACE, TO GET RID OF THE TARIFFS THAT ARE HURTING OUR ECONOMY.<br/>PARTICULARLY THOSE IN STEEL AND ALUMINUM AND SOFTWOOD LUMBER, AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE -- OF CUSMA.<br/>SO I THINK IT'S -- WE'RE IN A FUNNY PERIOD RIGHT NOW WHERE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS WHAT SOME OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE, AND WE DON'T WANT TO SACRIFICE THAT AND FIND OURSELVES IN A WORSE POSITION WHILE WE STILL STRIVE TO GET TO A BETTER ONE.<br/>   KATIE: REALLY QUICKLY, LAST QUESTION.<br/>IS THERE ANYTHING YOUR PROVINCE NEEDS IN THIS MOMENT AS YOU TRY TO NAVIGATE TARIFFS?<br/>   WELL, LOOK, FOR US, THE SOFTWOOD LUMBER TARIFFS THAT JUST WENT UP AND ARE GOING UP AGAIN SHORTLY ARE INCREDIBLY DAMAGING TO OUR ECONOMY.<br/>AND ACTUALLY THEY'RE INCREDIBLY DAMAGING TO THE U.S. WHO HAVE A REAL NEED FOR THE KIND OF INCREDIBLE HOMEBUILDING LUMBER THAT NEW BRUNSWICK PRODUCES.<br/>IT'S SOME OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND THEY'VE EXPRESSED A HOUSING CHALLENGE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE WOOD SUPPLY IN THE U.S. TO MEET THAT.<br/>SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SOFTWOOD LUMBER DEAL AND THOSE CONSIDERATIONS ARE ON THE TABLE AND THANKFULLY WE HAVE A PRIME MINISTER THAT IS UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE CANADIAN ECONOMY.<br/>THE DIFFERENCES AND THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF SOME OF US.<br/>WE SHARE THE ISSUE OF SOFTWOOD LUMBER WITH B.C. AS WELL AS OTHER PROVINCES.<br/>SO I THINK WE'RE BEING WELL REPRESENTED BY DOMINIC LEBLANC AND BY PRIME MINISTER CARNEY.<br/>I THINK WE NEED ALL CANADIANS TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING.<br/>BUY NEW BRUNSWICK.<br/>BUY CANADIAN.<br/>SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL ECONOMY.<br/>FIND WAYS TO REPLACE THOSE AMERICAN PRODUCTS SO WE CAN ALL BE STRONGER AND BETTER OFF AS WE CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THIS TARIFF FIGHT AND NEGOTIATION.<br/>   KATIE: ALL RIGHT, NEW BRUNSWICK PREMIER SUSAN HOLT.<br/>THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.<br/>   THANKS, KATIE.<br/>   KATIE: THE PALESTINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. IS URGING COUNTRIES TO TAKE CONCRETE ACTION TO END THE WAR IN GAZA.<br/>   FIND WAYS TO CONVINCE ONE PARTY TO COME CLOSER TO THE GLOBAL CONSENSUS THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.<br/>THE SOLUTION IS NOT WARS.<br/>WE HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.<br/>WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION.<br/>   KATIE: RIYAD MANSOUR SAYS CANADA HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY.<br/>HE JOINS ME FROM NEW YORK JUST AHEAD.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-PP2508133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGX-8CX3-RRRY-01X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

So we have an agreement with them ... that we respond to certain areas and assist them when needed.\"</p><p>\"If we have something while on fire within the city we need help for, the MNR\u00a0would come in and assist us.\"</p><p>In a media release, the Province of Ontario said it partnered with the federal government last year to invest $64 million in the provincial wildland fire program.</p><p>\"This investment has allowed Ontario to enhance its firefighting capacity for the 2025 fire season and includes funding for forest fire suppression equipment and technology, such as fuel systems, trucks and emergency management software,\" the release states.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadathunderbay2025forestfireseason17494822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FF7-TCM3-RRMP-72P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The City of Greenwood recognizes that it cannot tackle this challenge alone - it demands the active participation and commitment of multiple stakeholders working in concert.</p><p>City Council and the Greenwood Volunteer Fire Department play crucial roles in wildfire preparedness through proactive planning, resource allocation, and personnel training. The Regional District of Kootenay Boundary (RDKB) contributes essential support, expertise and emergency coordination on a wider geographic scale and specifically on the implementation of the FireSmart program. However, the most critical link in mounting an effective defense against wildfires is the engaged involvement of local property owners.</p><p>By maintaining defensible space around structures, utilizing fire-resistant landscaping and construction materials, and having a well-rehearsed evacuation plan, individual residents become indispensable partners in fortifying the entire community's resilience when facing an encroaching wildfire. Only by everyone - from elected officials to firefighters to homeowners - fully embracing their respective responsibilities can Greenwood be optimally equipped to confront the ever-present wildfire threat. Apathy is not an option; the city's wildfire readiness hinges on each person stepping up and doing their part in this essential collective endeavour.</p><p>As the Mayor, I also recognize that education around wildfire is essential. Hence why the City is increasing efforts to provide educational opportunities for the residents of Greenwood. This started on May 3rd with a Town Hall that provided a presentation by the British Columbia Wildfire Service on forest fire fighting 101. Staff are presently working with the RDKB to host another Town Hall that will focus on the FireSmart program and the City of Greenwood's Community Wildfire Resiliency Plan. Further communication tools are being developed including a full section in the new City website (estimated to be live at the end of the summer 2025) dedicated to all aspects of a wildfire event, including key links to the RDKB FireSmart program and grants available to homeowners.</p><p>FireSmart home evaluations are a critical first step for property owners looking to protect their homes and families from the threat of wildfire. These comprehensive assessments, offered free of charge by the RDKB, provide invaluable insights into the specific vulnerabilities and risk factors present on your property. By implementing these expert suggestions, homeowners can significantly enhance their property's resilience to wildfire, reducing the likelihood of ignition and improving the chances of the home surviving a fire event.</p><p>To take advantage of this potentially life-saving service, property owners simply need to visit the RDKB website and click on the FireSmart link under the Public Safety section. From there, booking a free FireSmart evaluation is a straightforward process that could make all the difference in safeguarding your home. However, if the community embraces this process, it can safeguard the entire City of Greenwood. As the Mayor, this is the standard we need to strive towards.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Grand Forks Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORKSG-news20250612PGF4734487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORKSG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1K-MGV3-RRYJ-23J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Most citizens accept speed cameras as a means to reduce driver speed in designated areas and thereby improve safety. But once their deployment is seen as contributing to the city's coffers, altruism concerning them is subordinated.</p><p>Let us not confuse financial penalties on speeders with taxes for city services. If a speed camera failed to capture even a single speeding driver, that would be reason to celebrate its success rather than bemoan the lack of revenue contribution.</p><p>Richard K. Leong, Woodbridge</p><p>I'm Canadian and happy to pay taxes for the greater goodTexans don't like taxes. They prefer to endure disaster and then file lawsuits, July 16</p><p>I really appreciated Heather Mallick's column on Texas and taxes. It recalls what my accountant said to me, \"Be happy. If you pay taxes, it means you're making money.\"</p><p>Taxes pay for many of the things we enjoy: keeping public beaches and pools clean and safe, paving our roads, helping those in need and funding healthcare and education.</p><p>I am glad I pay taxes here. I know the money goes through checks and balances before being spent. I know it is not perfect. But compared to the bureaucracies of other countries our governments operate effectively. Our standard of living is higher than that of the U.S.</p><p>Taxes are often low in countries that are right-leaning. In such nations, only the super-rich can afford good health care, good education for their kids and a comfortable way of life. The powerful see no need for social safety nets so the needy, the sick and the unfortunate are on their own.</p><p>Even though I'm on a pension, I am happy to pay my share here in Canada.</p><p>Gail Rutherford, Etobicoke</p><p>Doug Ford's evisceration of Ontario's education system must stopOntario to revamp college and university funding as early as next spring - and lifting tuition freeze may be on table, July 17</p><p>Sadly, this sounds like just more hot air and evasion from the Doug Ford government. We know the root cause of the crisis facing Ontario's colleges: chronic underfunding on the part of the provincial government.</p><p>We don't need more 'working groups' and we can't afford to wait until next spring. Raising student tuition isn't the answer. What's needed is an immediate injection of funding to stop the cuts and layoffs. Our provincial government needs to properly fund the education system.</p><p>When it comes to post-secondary education funding, Ontario ranks last among all the provinces, and it's not even close. Per-student funding to Ontario colleges sits at just 56 per cent of the national average. If this weren't bad enough, the Ford government just cut another $1.3 billion to the sector in its recent budget.</p><p>Enough is enough: the time to act is now.</p><p>Jeff Brown, Toronto</p><p>Canada needs stronger leadership when it comes to renewable energiesWildfire, tornado researchers look for answers in Jasper's charred forest, July 21</p><p>The record heat waves that produced disasters like that at Lytton, B.C. in 2021, plus the more recent catastrophes in Jasper and Los Angeles and this year's early forest fire season across the country, must remind us bold action against climate change is urgent.</p><p>But climate action is very low on the public agenda. Our new prime minister seems fixed upon more carbon emitting fossil fuel pipelines to cement our independence from Donald Trump's America.</p><p>Yes, we need such independence, but how to build it?</p><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney during his campaign spoke of Canada as a \"conventional and renewable energy superpower.\" So why not put major government subsidies and tax incentives into a national energy corridor of wind, solar, tidal and geo-thermal (already partially existing)?</p><p>If the world is to avoid more climate anomalies we need innovative national and international leadership on renewable energy.</p><p>Otherwise in coming years we will be hit by even nastier climate surprises.</p><p>Harold Wells, Burlington</p><p>AI can and will make a profound, helpful difference in many livesThis one thing could affect whether Canadians survive or thrive. Are you ready for the next great political revolution? July 21</p><p>I am apparently in the minority in my support of AI. In a short period of time, artificial intelligence has revolutionized access to information for those of us who are visually impaired.</p><p>The vast majority of information we all need and use to function in our daily lives comes visually. In 1821 Braille, the equivalent of the Guttenberg Press, arrived for the blind. Since then, techniques and technology have slowly closed the information gap. And now, AI has taken this access to an unprecedented level through real-time description of the immediate surroundings, signs and, for example, labels on pill bottles.</p><p>That which has the potential to brings good also can bring bad. The atomic bomb was developed with the sole purpose of death and destruction. Nuclear developments since then, however, have revolutionized medical diagnoses and renewable energy.</p><p>We look to our political leaders to understand and control the new and burgeoning resource that is artificial intelligence.</p><p>Jim Sanders, Guelph, Ont.</p><p>Speak up and silence the voices of hatePerformers pushing hate need to face the music, July 21</p><p>Entertainers must be held accountable for both their actions and their words. Too often their sense of entitlement and their popularity make them think they can spew dangerous calls for violence without fear of repercussions. Unfortunately, many of our youth see these individuals as role models and want to emulate their behaviour.</p><p>We have hate laws in Canada. Our young citizens must see that these laws are meaningful and enforced by our government, our courts and our police forces. There is no moral dilemma; there can only be zero tolerance for hate-fuelled calls for violence.</p><p>The voices that rise up against hatred must be louder than those who incite hate.</p><p>Phyllis Levin, Toronto</p><p>Where's the outrage over provincial supervision of school boards?TDSB trustees ordered to turn in phones, computers, July 18</p><p>Where is the public outrage over the neutering of public school trustees in four Ontario school boards? This is grossly undemocratic, as the trustees are duly elected officials.</p><p>The Minister of Education is overreaching and taking draconian measures.</p><p>Where is the Ontario Public School Board Association's condemnation?</p><p>Hopefully this is not the first step to eliminating school trustees altogether.</p><p>Joel Hertz, Toronto</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025072376154998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB5-YMW3-RRHJ-S274-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

In this case, printers were not working due to the power outage.</p><p>\"At the time these radio logs were being transcribed, the risk to Jasper's dispatch team was deemed too high for them to safely remain in the townsite, and they had already been evacuated. As a result, incident management personnel were assigned to maintain communication records.\"</p><p>In a video released as part of the access to information request, viewers can see just how dangerous the fire was.\u00a0</p><p>Rapid-fire incidents</p><p>The days leading up to the fire were hot with temperatures hovering around 30 C. Parks Canada officials told CBC News that conditions for starting a forest fire were prime.\u00a0</p><p>In the late afternoon of July 22, lightning strikes sparked three fires about 30 kilometres south of Jasper.</p><p><br/><br/> Within hours, there was an evacuation order for more than 25,000 people and hundreds of firefighters were called to help protect the town.</p><p>But soon the fires joined together and started to move toward the Jasper townsite, becoming too big for firefighters to handle.\u00a0</p><p>The flames were hundreds of metres high, flinging embers up to half a kilometre ahead, which started\u00a0new fires.\u00a0</p><p>Two days later at 6:14 p.m., explosions rock Connaught Drive, the main thoroughfare of Jasper.

The Government of Canada, along with the provinces, territories and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), is seized with the importance of supporting Canadians whose lives and livelihoods are at stake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Governments of Canada, British Columbia, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Manitoba, together with the CIFFC, announced a total investment of $104 million through the Government of Canada's Resilient Communities through FireSmart (RCF) Program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FireSmart  Canadais a key part of our national wildfire prevention and mitigation efforts. Led by CIFFC, the program identifies and reduces wildfire risks and provides actionable guidance for homeowners and communities. The funding announced today will help enhance FireSmart  programming and support the provinces and territories in increasing capacity and assisting community-based projects to help prevent wildfires and mitigate their impacts, including Indigenous communities that are disproportionately threatened by wildfires.</p><p>These investments are strengthening the federal government's actions and efforts to enhance and expand wildfire prevention and mitigation across all levels of government.By working together with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and international allies, the Government of Canada continues to support the fight against wildfires in communities across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"No Canadian should have to worry about a wildfire threatening their community   but as extreme weather increases, the Government of Canada is providing provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and partners with the support they need to fight wildfires. I would like to thank all Canadians, especially first responders, for working to protect one another. The federal government stands with you and is working to build resilience for this wildfire season, and the future.\"</p><p>The Honourable Tim HodgsonMinister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"Across Canada and around the world, climate change is forcing us to change how we think about wildfires   I see this in every community I visit in British Columbia. Preventing wildfires is a shared responsibility, and the only way forward is by working together. From supporting grassroots community projects and education, to expanding government's role in building a safer, more-resilient future, our shared investment with the Government of Canada is testament to a whole-of-society approach for living with wildfire.\"</p><p>The Honourable Ravi Parmar British Columbia Minister of Forests</p><p>\"Building wildfire resilience involves an approach focused on prevention, mitigation and being ready to respond to wildfires threatening our homes and communities. This investment will help communities apply FireSmart principles that will enhance collaboration, build greater awareness and help reduce wildfire risk.\"</p><p>The Honourable Todd Loewen Alberta Minister of Forestry and Parks</p><p>\"Preparing for the threat of wildfire is a shared responsibility   we all have a part to play. FireSmart's practical, effective and science-based programs help residents reduce the risk of wildfires in our communities and ensure residents are better prepared when wildfires occur. Through the FireSmart program, we will continue our ongoing work with Newfoundland and Labrador communities to help keep our residents safe.\"</p><p>The Honourable LisaDempsterNewfoundland and Labrador Minister of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture</p><p>\"Canadians   especially those of us in the North   are focused on preparing for wildfires. This investment, from both our government and the Government of Canada, will support important wildfire prevention efforts in the Yukon. This includes developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans and a territorial prevention and mitigation strategy; constructing large-scale fuel breaks and improving our training; and modelling and risk assessment. Together, we are building wildfire-resilient communities across the Yukon.\"</p><p>The Honourable Richard MostynYukon Minister of Community Services </p><p>\"Wildfire is everyone's responsibility, and we thank Nova Scotians for their vigilance that's helping keep our people and our communities safe. Through our partnership with the federal government, we're continuing to help people adopt the FireSmart principles around their homes and in their communities so we can avoid the devastation and upheaval that wildfires can cause.\"</p><p>The Honourable Tory Rushton Nova Scotia Minister of Natural Resources</p><p>\"Prince Edward Island is in a good position to respond to fire thanks to local, provincial and federal support that we are using to continually build our wildland fire fighting capacity. It is great to see more Islanders and local communities embracing FireSmart principles, and we are committed to increasing our prevention, mitigation and response efforts.\"</p><p>The Honourable Gilles Arsenault Prince Edward Island Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Action</p><p>\"As Manitobans bravely pull together to battle one of the most challenging fire seasons in recent memory, wildfire preparedness is more crucial than ever. We thank and honour the incredible work of our wildfire service, local firefighters, Indigenous and municipal leadership and members of the public who are working together to ensure that the thousands of displaced residents remain safe and healthy. The entire government of Manitoba strongly supports any and all initiatives that recognize the need for investing in firefighting preparedness, and we congratulate the federal government on its continuing efforts to address the needs of firefighters and evacuees.\"</p><p>The Honourable Ian Bushie Manitoba Minister of Natural Resources and Indigenous Futures</p><p>\"Through this funding, Canadians will be in a better position to protect themselves from the dangers of wildland fire. By working together, using the core FireSmart principles, we can become more resilient and more prepared to face the challenges ahead.\"</p><p>Kelsey WinterExecutive Director of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> The Government of Canada is providing $9.1 million over five years to the CIFFC under the RCF program.

While the smoke has made it harder for fire crews to tackle the blazes, at the same time, \"haze has also led to higher relative humidity and less intense heat from the sun, which has helped to reduce fire activity.\"</p><p>Still, \"with skies beginning to clear near the Manitoba border and stronger winds in the forecast, an increase in fire behaviour is possible,\" Bezubiak said.</p><p>The wildland fire hazard is low to moderate across much of the northwest, except for the western edge of the region along the Ontario-Manitoba border, where there hasn't been as much rainfall.</p><p>\"From the town of Fort Frances and spanning northward to Opasquia Provincial Park, the hazard is mainly high, with an area of extreme hazard around Weeskayjahk Ohtahzhoganeeng Provincial Park,\" said Bezubiak.</p><p>Besides Red Lake 62 and Red Lake 40, other fires of note include Red Lake 67, west of McDowell Lake First Nation, at more than 32,000 hectares large, and Red Lake 72, east of Poplar Hill First Nation, at over 4,900 hectares.</p><p>Red Lake 12, the largest fire in the region, continues to be observed at more than 195,000 hectares, making it Ontario's largest wildfire on record in terms of hectares burned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Air quality statements continue</emphasis></p><p>Well over a dozen air quality statements remain in effect in northwestern Ontario due to wildfire smoke, including for the City of Thunder Bay.</p><p>\"We did have a low-pressure system move off into Hudson Bay, which will bring northwesterly winds over northwestern Ontario, so that's kind of funnelling that smoke from those wildfires into the area,\" said Kristina Kretchman, meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, in an interview with CBC News on Sunday.</p><p>Poor air quality is expected to persist Sunday night and possibly Monday before improving, she said. Symptoms include eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough.</p><p>\"If you work outdoors, see if you can reduce exertion.

Walter Colquhoun Grant planted a European perennial shrub on his farm on T\u2019Sou-ke Nation\u2019s traditional territory (Sooke).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He thought the shrub \u2014 Cytisus scorparius in Latin \u2014 would bring back nostalgia of his Scottish homeland, covered with hills of yellow flowers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One-hundred and seventy-five years later, this shrub is now one of the most notorious invasive species on Vancouver Island known colloquially as Scotch broom. Vast areas of the Island are covered in this plant, exhibiting what a changed landscape can look like if invasive plants are allowed to spread and take over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It competes with native plants, disrupts streams and has no known natural predators. It can also live up to 25 years and produces seeds that can survive in the soil for 30 years.</p><p>Scotch broom is also extremely flammable, leading to growing concern as the climate changes and Earth warms.</p><p>Luckily, one Vancouver Island-wide organization has been working for nearly two decades to decrease the abundance of Scotch broom in local areas, and an invasive species expert says groups such as these, along with other forms of traditional land management that draw on Indigenous knowledge, give him hope that disastrous wildfires sparked by broom can be mitigated or avoided.</p><p>Invasive plants and wildfire:a \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 Hunter Jarratt is an ecological restoration consultant based in the Nanaimo area, and is more famously known as the Invasive Species Guy. He told The Discourse that Scotch broom has a high oil content, so it\u2019s flammable even while it\u2019s still green and alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about six feet tall, so if you have a pile that\u2019s as tall as me the flames would easily grow to three or four times that in a matter of minutes \u2014 seconds, even,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Vancouver Island doesn\u2019t see a fire similar to the one in 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Hawaii, and was amplified due to invasive grasses.</p><p>The grasses were left over from sugar cane plantations and, similarly to broom, would crowd out native species. According to reporting from the Washington Post, powerlines fell on the fields of grass in 2023 leading to a disastrous wildfire that killed 102 people.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty concerning, especially the ecosystems that have grasslands that are a mix of these dry grasses, Scotch brooms and maybe some other shrubs in there too. There\u2019s just so much fuel in those places that it\u2019s a sleeping giant,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Jarratt also explained how invasive species can fuel fires by changing the natural fire cycle of an ecosystem. This is referred to as the invasive plant/fire cycle.</p><p>These new invaders, he explained, will add fuel to the ecosystem so more intense and severe fires will occur. After the fire, because those species were already present in that ecosystem, they will be the first to colonize and repopulate those sites.</p><p>Jarratt said the invasive plants push out native species that can\u2019t adapt quickly, taking advantage of sunlight and nutrients. The increase in invasive species makes the ecosystem less resilient, creating a monoculture and setting the stage for another fire.</p><p>This is all amplified by climate change and increasingly common drought conditions, he added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s leading to a pretty rapid instability of an ecosystem. It\u2019s invade, burn, repeat over and over again. So it\u2019s quite concerning.\u201d</p><p>Jarratt said the undermining of Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship is another big contributor to the spread of invasive species.</p><p>The colonial government has historically put forth policies of fire suppression, such as the 1874 Bush Fire Act that banned Indigenous cultural burning. Research shows these policies have led to a build-up of forest fire fuels, increased fire risk, decreased forest resilience and, in turn, more out-of-control wildfires.</p><p>\u201cAs much as fire is scary, not all fire is bad,\u201d Jarratt said, adding that ecosystems such as the Garry oak ecosystem traditionally relied on regular, low-intensity ground fires to limit the spread of competing tree species.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I always like to talk about with this kind of conversation with burning and with Scotch broom is the Garry oak ecosystem, which there is way less of in the Comox Valley now,\u201d Jarratt said.</p><p>Busting broom Jarratt said he still sees opportunities for people to learn how to manage invasive species in their areas.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to control it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPeople who have farmland and natural areas on their land, as long as you\u2019re doing your part to keep invasive species in check, I think we\u2019d be in a much better position.\u201d</p><p>One of the organizations that inspired Jarratt to learn more about invasive species involves a group of committed people who are determined to get rid of as much invasive Scotch broom as possible:The Broombusters. Bev Agur has been committed to cutting down broom since 2010, when she became involved.</p><p>The organization that was founded in 2006 by Joanne Sales, who noticed a lot of Scotch broom growing near her blueberry farm in Coombs. Since then, this volunteer-run organization has expanded all across Vancouver Island, including in the Comox Valley, Cowichan Valley and Nanaimo.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I moved out to the Comox Valley in 2009 from Alberta, and we didn\u2019t really know anything about broom,\u201d Agur said.</p><p>She has been cutting broom with the organization since 2010, and is now the area organizer for the Comox Valley\u2019s division of Broombusters. For six days a week, for six weeks of the year when broom is in season, the group of Broombusters goes out to cut it down.</p><p>Like Jarratt, she\u2019s learned how much of a fire risk it is.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s broom that\u2019s growing under a powerline \u2026 if a wildfire gets there, it\u2019ll just take off,\u201d she said.</p><p>Agur said the summer is not the best time to cut broom, because if it is cut and sits and dries out, it is a fire risk.</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem is it\u2019s full of seed pods, so you run the risk of spreading those around,\u201d she said.</p><p>Those who are curious to learn about Comox Valley broom cutting can keep their eyes out for when to join in the spring. She added that there is a video on the organization\u2019s website that explains how to cut broom properly.</p><p>\u201cWe have lots of tools so people could show up and cut broom with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI suggest they bring some work gloves or gardening gloves, and wear dirty shoes and old clothes, because often broom is growing around blackberries and roses.\u201d</p><p>Controlling the fire Jarratt said getting involved with invasive species control and learning more about controlled burning (also known as prescribed burning) are some of the best ways to manage invasive species and fire risk.</p><p>Controlled burning helps reduce the amount of fuel load \u2014 what is available to burn in an area. After years go by, the fuel builds up on the ground as vegetation grows and falls to the forest floor and then is available to burn again, Jarratt explained. He also said some plant species such as Lodgepole pine are dependent on fire, so they won\u2019t germinate unless there is a fire.</p><p>Prescribed burns are often lighter and less hot as well, he said. They\u2019re small enough to support germination but not big enough that it burns the whole ecosystem down.</p><p>On the south Island, Jarratt pointed to biologist James Miskelly who does prescribed burns at Rocky Point, home to a Garry oak ecosystem which has historically relied on controlled burning to keep it healthy.</p><p>In B.C. \u2019s southern interior, known for its dry landscape and frequent wildfires, groups such as the Salish Fire Keepers Society and Ntityix Resources have taken up Indigenous-led controlled burning, something that was suppressed from colonialism after being practiced for millennia.</p><p>\u201cI feel like this is going to be an increasingly important factor as more areas evidently burn on Vancouver Island in the future,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially all these hilly ecosystems that have huge fuel loads that have built up over many, many, many years, but are now also invaded by these highly flammable species like Scotch broom.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOFUWN-news20250730PTCA0004859133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOFUWN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCN-7H93-S1TG-Y01S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438260</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The centre hosts diplomats, policymakers, business leaders and academics in an elite, non-partisan setting.\u00a0</p><p>In March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order cutting about one-third of the centre's funding. In April, 130 of the centre's staff were placed on leave, effectively <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-shutters-dc-foreign-policy-think-tank-wilson-center-2025-04-04/\">shutting down</url> its operations. The centre is not currently taking media requests, the centre's former media relations manager told Canadian Affairs.</p><p>The Alberta government is stepping in to fill the diplomatic vacuum. In May, Premier Danielle Smith <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.policyschool.ca/news/school-launches-new-north-america-initiative-focused-on-canada-u-s-relations/\">announced</url> her government would provide $6.5 million in funding to the New North America Initiative.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's no secret that our relationship has hit a rocky patch these past few months,\" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a May 16 press conference announcing the initiative.</p><p>\"The way we see it, any rift between us is a huge loss for both countries. If things continue to change between Canada and the United States, we want it to be changed for the better,\" she said.</p><p>The NNAI aims to be operational by the spring of 2026, says CarloDade, a director of international policy at Calgary's School of Public Policy who will lead the initiative. He says the NNAI will emphasize applied research, grassroots engagement and regional collaboration.</p><p>Varun Chandrasekar, press secretary for Alberta's ministry of advanced education, says the institute will help address a research gap.</p><p>\"[W]e have found that there is a real shortage of academic research on the Canada-U.S. relationship that is focused on Alberta and western Canada,\" Chandrasekar told Canadian Affairs in a written statement.\u00a0</p><p>\"If we are to respond effectively to these shifting dynamics in the Canada-U.S. relationship, all parts of Canada must be heard and reflected in our academic and policy thinking,\" he said.\u00a0</p><h>'A new understanding'</h><p>Dade says the NNAI will avoid top-down consultations in favour of regional collaboration and outreach within central North America.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're not just taking the guy at the end of the bar and taking his word,\" said Dade, noting his interest in meeting with local chambers of commerce and small business leaders.</p><p>\"We're going to go to the grassroots ... and take from them a new understanding of North America - a new language and priorities,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is about Prairie pragmatism,\" he added, noting his interest in finding practical, non-partisan solutions to kitchen-table issues that matter to Canadians and Americans.</p><p>In Dade's view, Canada's \"standard approach\" of framing the trade war as a loss to U.S. states is not effective.</p><p>\"When you're talking to Americans and you say, 'We're your largest trade partner.' That's not as important to state officials, unless that state official happens to have a major Canadian plant that employs hundreds of people in that congressional district,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>He noted that, for many U.S. states, exports to Canada account for a tiny portion - three to four per cent - of their GDP. By contrast, exports to the U.S. account for about two-thirds of Alberta's.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Instead, there is a need to focus on areas of shared interest, he says.

The latest in a series of demonstrations saw 100 protesters march from Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium June 22.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tabled in April by Natural Resources Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina, the legislation would divide forests into three categories: conservation zones, multi-purpose zones balancing conservation and development, and intensive logging zones. By 2028, Vezina suggested, at least 30% of Quebec\u2019s forests would be used exclusively by industry.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While forestry corporations support it, Bill 97 is opposed by Indigenous leaders, environmental groups, unions and forestry researchers. Unions affiliated with the CSN say empowering industry to manage intensive forestry zones would rapidly deplete the resource, threatening long-term employment.</p><p>Professor Christian Messier, an expert on forest ecology, proposed the approach that inspired the bill in order to prioritize biodiversity. He said it should \u201cnot be implemented with the primary objective of helping the forestry industry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Quebec\u2019s Forest Research Centre lamented a lack of consultation, and one professor argued it will result in \u201cmassive plant closures in 10 to 15 years.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>First Nations leaders firmly rejected the bill long before it was introduced. An open letter from 20 chiefs in December declared \u201cyou cannot partition the territory to dispossess us of part of our land and offer it to industry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Lac-Simon Anishnaabe Nation Chief Lucien Wabanonik called it a \u201cdirect provocation\u201d that undermines First Nations rights in favour of forestry companies.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis bill needs to be completely reformed,\u201d said Francis Verreault-Paul, Regional Chief of the Assembly of First NationsQuebec and Labrador. Disappointed that the AFNQL\u2019s clear recommendations to the minister were ignored, he said the bill essentially gives industry the right to bypass consultations with First Nations.</p><p>While Bill 97 allows Indigenous activities in forestry zones, the AFNQL said that clause \u201cin no way guarantees the preservation of the quality of these territories, which are essential to the preservation of their traditional ways of life, cultures and languages.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Members of the Innu, Atikamekw and Abenaki nations organized the Mamo-Mamu alliance (meaning \u201ctogether\u201d). They have raised teepees to mark Indigenous sovereignty on unceded lands and staged road blockades to halt logging activities. One action blocked traffic to Montreal\u2019s Jacques-Cartier Bridge during rush hour.\u00a0</p><p>In May, Mamo-Mamu and the Association des Gardiens du territoire Nehirowisiw Aski (Abenaki) sent eviction notices to 11 forestry companies, ordering them to immediately remove their workers and equipment from unceded Indigenous territory. The registered letter targeted \u201cmultifunctional harvesters\u201d, ordering companies to evacuate all employees and contractors.</p><p>Following public consultations and protests, Blanchette-V\u00e9zina suggested that \u201csignificant amendments will be made, particularly in collaboration with First Nations\u201d when the National Assembly resumes after the summer. However, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault later said that no major changes were planned.</p><p>On June 9, the Cree Nation Government announced it is conducting a detailed review of Bill 97 and meet with Quebec to ensure the legislation respects \u201ctreaty obligations, shared commitments and recognized governance structures.\u201d The CNG affirmed that the bill does not take legal precedence over forestry provisions in 2002\u2019s Paix des Braves agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe Paix des Braves is a legally binding agreement, and the Adapted Forestry Regime is incorporated by reference to the JBNQA, which is constitutionally protected,\u201d read the statement. \u201cAs such, it forms part of the Cree Nation\u2019s treaty framework and reflects the mutual obligations of both the Cree Nation and the Government of Qu\u00e9bec.\u201d</p><p>Under the Adapted Forestry Regime, the Cree are collaborators in the industry\u2019s management plans. Cree traplines remain the basis for forest planning, with tallymen able to designate Sites of Special Interest (1%) and Areas of Wildlife Interest (25%).</p><p>However, many Cree land defenders feel that protected areas are insufficient, and that existing agreements are not being respected. One complaint is that wildlife habitat directives that were to be included in the Paix des Braves have yet to be implemented.</p><p>In 2023, the CNG paused consultations with the province after it blamed that summer's massive forest fires for again failing to address the issue. While Schedule C-5 in the 2002 pact allows logging in 70% of a forest fire site, Crees say species like moose and bear feed from the new vegetation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for them to cut so much,\u201d said Waswanipi forest expert Allan Saganash. \u201cThey only cut the first year, then say the lumber\u2019s no good because there\u2019s too many insects eating the trees. Many traplines closed from the fires were reopened because they\u2019re having requests for biomass.\u201d</p><p>Biomass can be processed at nearby Chapais \u00c9nergie as renewable fuel or feedstock. Following forest fires, companies salvage the remaining wood then mechanically scarify the land and eliminate competitive growth. Saganash explained that each stage damages the territory and is incompatible with the Cree way of life.</p><p>Cree tallymen are increasingly rejecting forestry plans that repeatedly ignore their wishes for trapline protection. Paul Dixon is currently in a conciliation process with the Cree-Quebec Forestry Board over his refusal to allow further logging activities on trapline W23A. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the first tallyman who said you can\u2019t touch that burnt wood and requested they plant birch and poplar trees for mooseyards,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t cut on hills and mountains, and should leave larger buffer zones of trees near shorelines.\u201d</p><p>While the sudden disappearance of Lake Rouge on Dixon's neighbouring trapline last month following a landslide continues to be investigated, forestry companies continue building roads and harvesting wood there. Although the disaster's exact cause hasn't been determined, many believe that salvage logging and scarification has exacerbated fire damage, removing root systems and the soil's capacity to maintain the shorelines.</p><p>\"Forestry has to change after Lake Rouge,\" Dixon asserted. \"There's huge clear-cut mountains upriver at Opawica where a landslide could rush it out with such force. For Crees living in logged out areas, it's getting dangerous.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-821596c364f64f15a3023b2faba68e32</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8X-1PN3-RRHH-S4JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><timeReceived>05:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 16, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Those charts of geopolitical risk indices that had looked like rocket trails to infinity as Donald Trump resettled in the White House now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/interactive-charts/geopolitical-risk-dashboard\">resemble</url> sketches of the Himalayan mountain chain. We've come off peak chaos. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, everything's relative when the U.S. president treats the rudder of world affairs like it's an on/off switch. It's worth noting that even the Lesser Himalayas climb some 4,000 metres into the sky. Similarly, what passes for calm these days still means a risk premium that could severely hobble global commerce. Export Development Canada is among the latest to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edc.ca/content/dam/edc/en/non-premium/global-economic-outlook-summer-2025.pdf\">predict</url> that all the uncertainty will cause a Canadian recession this year.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The BlackRock Institute tracks 10 major geopolitical risks and it ranks only one of those threats-a breakup of the European Union-as \"low.\" Three are \"medium,\" and six are marked as \"high.\" And that's only the political stuff. It was harder to breathe in Toronto and Montreal than New Delhi and Beijing again this week because of drifting forest-fire smoke, a reminder that our real war is with climate change, not the Trump administration.\u00a0</p><p>University of Toronto philosopher Mark Kingwell <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.biblioasis.com/shop/non-fiction/cultural-criticism/on-risk/\">wrote</url> in 2020 that if humans understood that life was a series of bets, we'd choose not to play. That's why narratives are so important. Stories guide us forward, like flashlights in the dark. What happens when all those torches flicker at once? It's worth considering because the extreme uncertainty probably isn't going away.\u00a0 </p><p>Former Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/6ee2057a-5ef6-480f-a641-7f94a95e6a3d?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=editorial\">thinks</url> we've entered a new industrial revolution marked by automation, digitization and artificial intelligence. Previous industrial revolutions brought the steam engine, electricity and the internet. Poloz observed in a recent essay that those periods also brought the kind of geopolitical chaos that we're experiencing now.\u00a0</p><p>Before society benefited broadly from each of those shifts, the lives of many individual workers were disrupted, while the inventors of those technologies reaped outsized rewards. The unfairness fed populism, which led to reactionary policies and power vacuums that created opportunities for \"geopolitical opportunism.\"\u00a0</p><p>Poloz's thumbnail description of the mid-1800s, the early 1900s and the mid-1980s echoes loudly today. It's natural to assume that things will settle down, because <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">settled</emphasis> is what we know. It's the backdrop for the narrative we've constructed of how the world works. You see it in the assumptions that the central banks will eventually dull the pain of this crisis by cutting interest rates, like they have during every other crisis over the past few decades. Yet the inflation numbers <url normalizedValue=\"https://thelogic.co/briefing/july-interest-rate-cut-unlikely-as-inflation-pressures-build/\">refuse</url> to co-operate.\u00a0</p><p>If Poloz is right, our individual reference points are useless because we're no longer in Happy Valley, that utopian moment where the peace dividend, globalization and rapid productivity growth combined to create a period of abundance. That could make coping with what's to come extremely hard.\u00a0</p><p>\"Fundamental structural changes in economies are rarely done in wisdom and foresight,\" Poloz wrote. \"They are usually forced upon us. And the forcing mechanism is likely to be rising economic, financial and geopolitical stress, not a return to calm.\"\u00a0</p><p>I've started to think that our ability to cope with the unknown will determine how we come out of this moment in history. Canada will need to rely on its wits, which means getting comfortable with making bets on an uncertain future. This is where everything that Prime Minister Mark Carney and the provinces are trying to do could break down. We've spent decades trying to erase risk from economic life to the point that few of us are willing to do anything without a guarantee.\u00a0</p><p>\"Canada has become less and less risk tolerant,\" said Nancy Southern, chief executive of Calgary-based Atco, the electricity utility that has sidelines in renewable energy, modular building construction and defence. \"Everybody wants everything buttoned up. That's the tone from the regulator. That's the tone from the government, all levels of government. That's actually the tone from boards of companies today. You can't make a mistake.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It's tempting to assume the profit motive will propel Canada's capitalistic economy into the future, no matter the size of the abyss. That hope might be what Kingwell, citing <url normalizedValue=\"https://iep.utm.edu/zizek/\">Slavoj Zizek</url>, called an \"unknown known\"-a risk that goes unexamined because it's so tightly threaded into our idea of how things work. Profit margins have been strong and periods of disruption present all kinds of opportunity. But while fortune might still favour the bold, the finance industry has worked hard to make sure that doing almost nothing with one's profits is also highly lucrative.\u00a0</p><p>In May, I asked Cenovus chief executive <url normalizedValue=\"https://thelogic.co/news/the-interview/why-the-ceo-of-oilsands-giant-cenovus-is-feeling-hopeful-amid-the-chaos/\">Jon McKenzie</url> why business investment in the oil industry had become so weak. One of the reasons he cited was onerous regulation and lower oil prices had made it too hard to expand production. But another reason is that companies such as Cenovus can keep their shareholders happy by repurchasing stock. \"It's made capital allocation a much simpler game if you understand your worst-case scenario is where you're just buying back your stock,\" McKenzie said. \"You understand the returns on that. Any investment you make in the business needs to supersede those kinds of returns.\"\u00a0</p><p>The point isn't to further demonize share buybacks. I surfaced that comment to show that an unintended consequence of our efforts to remove risk from the economy has dulled the impulse to move things forward. There are other examples. Nova Scotia billionaire John Bragg, who founded Oxford Wild Blueberries and Bragg Communications, <url normalizedValue=\"https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/john-bragg/\">told</url> podcaster Shane Parrish last year that his family's investment portfolio includes \"a lot of Buffett,\" and that they had been considering an investment in a riskier company, but decided they'd rather buy more shares in Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet's publicly traded holding company. Why roll the dice when you can ride with one of history's greatest investors?\u00a0</p><p>It's going to take a lot of coaxing to get private money to take the leap into the unknown. It's all the more reason for governments to keep doing what they're doing. They are going to have to light the way.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin Carmichael is </emphasis>The Logic<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'s economics columnist and editor-at-large.

They also said there wasn't enough screening planned for the sides and rear of the site.</p><p>A 2008 forest fire through the area left the property with little vegetation and few trees.</p><p>But Halifax staff said the shrubs that remained, in combination\u00a0with the proposed location of the facility about 200 to 340 metres from side property lines and 30 metres from the rear, was enough to reduce the impact\u00a0on surrounding landowners.</p><p/><p>Coun. Nancy Hartling said she couldn't believe that was enough to meet municipal criteria.</p><p>\"I don't understand how that wasn't called out really early on,\" Hartling said. \"I feel like this is significant. Like how could it not be?\"</p><p>Coun. Patty Cuttell agreed.</p><p>\"You're an adjacent property and you're looking across, you're gonna see a 20-foot pile, you're gonna see that,\" Cuttell said.</p><p>The plan did include new landscaping like berms and coniferous trees along the front of the site\u00a0to hide it from the road.</p><p>Residents also brought up concerns about the facility's potential impact on\u00a0wetlands and wildlife on the site, as well as\u00a0run-off from the facility impacting\u00a0wells in the area. But a municipal lawyer reminded councillors that the province is responsible for wetlands and environmental impact, and they could only base their decision <url normalizedValue=\"https://pub-halifax.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=2253\">on specific site plan criteria like landscaping </url>and separation distances.</p><p/><p>Regional council narrowly voted to reject the site plan by\u00a0a vote of 7-6. The two area councillors for the site's location, Trish Purdy and David Hendsbee, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/controversial-halifax-waste-facility-could-move-ahead-after-court-rules-councillors-biased-1.7367939\">had been ordered by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court</url> to not take part in the vote because they appeared biased against the proposed facility when community council rejected the site plan in October 2023.</p><p>Resident Mike Thomas, who lives about 600 metres west of the proposed site, said Thursday that council's rejection felt \"wonderful at the time.\" But\u00a0he said his relief was short-lived because Kiann Management can now re-submit a site plan addressing the screening issues.</p><p>Thomas has been fighting the facility alongside other residents since Kiann first applied to rezone the land back in 2015.</p><p>Although the local community council rejected that request, the Nova Scotia<url normalizedValue=\"http://nsuarb.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/Decision%20M09172.pdf\">Utility and Review Board overruled that decision in 2020</url>. It said Halifax's planning rules allowed the land to be rezoned from its mixed-use designation to allow for a C&amp;D facility.\u00a0</p><p>\"We've had victory after victory, but you know, we still face the prospect of this potentially still being put in our community,\" Thomas said.</p><p>\"We're still ... ready to, you know, keep the fight going as long as it takes.\"</p><p/><p>The proposed facility would recycle construction materials like concrete, asphalt, brick, drywall, asphalt shingles and metals - classified as CD-2 - but would not be a dump. Halifax classifies those disposal sites as CD-3, and they come with different rules and regulations.</p><p>There are currently two C&amp;D processing facilities in the Halifax region, owned by the same operator. The Kiann site would be the first C&amp;D recycling facility approved in decades in Halifax.</p><p>If Halifax eventually approves the site plan, Kiann would then have to apply for a licence from HRM, an environmental permit from the province, and other municipal permits that\u00a0all come with their own regulations and oversight from staff at both levels of government.</p><p>The Nova Scotia provincial government brought in <url normalizedValue=\"https://novascotia.ca/nse/pubs/docs/solid-waste-management-facility-guidelines-construction-demolition-debris-storage-transfer-process-disposal.pdf\">stricter environmental regulations for C&amp;D facilities</url> in 2023, and Halifax is in the midst of <url normalizedValue=\"https://pub-halifax.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=2267\">updating its own C&amp;D bylaw </url>to focus on limiting impacts to surrounding communities.</p><p>Those changes include requiring facilities to have a litter management plan and diversion strategy for recycling materials, increasing insurance requirements to a liability coverage of $5 million, and upping the penalties for facilities that don't meet recycling targets.</p><p>A staff report on whether Halifax planning rules can be updated to designate locations for future C&amp;D facilities, keeping them out of residential areas, is expected this fall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE TOP STORIES\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanovascotiahalifaxcouncilrejectsplanforporterslakeconstructionwastefacility17577253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G68-J923-RWWK-02VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><timeReceived>5:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Maureen Wheeler's Escape or Cody Tresierra's Dad's Skates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People who are interested in taking part have until August 22 to submit stories. More information can be found on the art gallery's website.</p><p>A bear with a beautiful backdrop of fire is the main thing you may notice when looking at Maureen Wheeler's Escape, but once you look closer, you'll see smaller scenes of bears and a raven.</p><p>The painting was inspired by Wheeler seeing a bear on her property in Quesnel during a particularly difficult forest fire year.</p><p>\"This young grizzly bear appeared in my neighbourhood in town,\" she explained. \"We've always had black bears, lots of black bears, but never grizzly bears. I believe it was because the forest fires and the crazy drought conditions that year in 2023. So he was on the lookout for food, water, shelter, maybe.\"</p><p>Seeing that grizzly trying to survive in a changing climate is what inspired Wheeler's piece. Her process involves sketching out what she wants it to look like and picturing it in her mind.</p><p>\"That one was kind of experimental, the way I did the background and stuff. I was trying some new things and I just liked the way it went,\" she said.</p><p>Wheeler has been creating art for over 40 years. She started as a child drawing horses and things like that and has stuck with art ever since. As she grew up, she had less time for art but always found time to keep creative on weekends or during evenings.</p><p>\"I get a little depressed if I can't do art for a period of time,\" she said.</p><p>She wanted her piece to be part of the contest because it has a story of survival around it and she wanted to see what creative ways people can expand on that story.</p><p>\"I hope the stories can reflect the emotion behind the painting. The themes of displacement, survival, the powerful instincts that the animals have and what they have to go through when the world around them is changing,\" she said. \"I'd love to see writers explore the connection between memory and instinct and how the natural world still speaks to us if we're willing to listen.\"</p><p>She said people can do a great job sending that kind of message no matter what perspective the story is written from whether it's the bear, the raven or a person watching things unfold.</p><p>\"I hope the stories carry that sense of awe, urgency and empathy for the wild and for ourselves.\"</p><p>Wheeler has always enjoyed painting wildlife and spends a lot of time in nature listening and observing. The year after the grizzly was in her yard, she found an orphaned black bear cub in the same area and the Northern Lights Wildlife Society in Smithers rescued the cub.

That\u2019s the size of nearly 600 football fields.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis is a scary time for our province,\u201d Premier Susan Holt said at a news conference in Fredericton late Monday, trying to reassure people provincial officials were putting all their efforts into keeping everyone safe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She did not try to sugar coat the situation, warning it had worsened since Saturday when officials held the last news conference, despite one fire in the Canterbury area now under control.</p><p>\u201cWe are doing everything possible to protect you and our communities and our forests,\u201d the premier said.</p><p>\u201cBut we know the hot, humid, windy weather is going to continue for the foreseeable future. I think Bathurst today recorded higher temperatures than some parts of Florida. So we need to take all possible precautions to avoid the spread of existing fires or the starting of new fires.\u201d</p><p>Public Safety Minister Robert Gauvin asked people in the Irishtown, Tankville, \u00c9vang\u00e9line and Lakefield areas, just north of Moncton, to be prepared to evacuate on short notice.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a need to evacuate, we will let you know. You will see it on your TVs, hear it on your radios, read it on your phones and computers. We will find a way to reach you. But until that time, please keep calm and be prepared.\u201d</p><p>The minister added police are patrolling in those spread out communities and will knock on doors if they believe some people haven\u2019t heard an evacuation order. An Alert Ready message will also be issued if the situation becomes urgent.</p><p>In the event of an evacuation, the Maple Hills rural community, which governs most people in the area, has offered the use of the Maple Hills Moncton Kia Centre as an emergency shelter for people who don\u2019t have family or friends they can stay with. It has a gym and several community rooms.</p><p>Gauvin also encouraged people to prepare an evacuation plan and emergency kit if they haven\u2019t done so, with bottled water, food, blankets, flashlight, radio, batteries, first aid kit, prescription medication, cash, a spare set of clothes and infant formula, if necessary, ready to go in a bag or backpack.</p><p>Unfortunately, what New Brunswick needs most \u2013 rain \u2013 isn\u2019t in the forecast for several days.</p><p>Roger Collet, a fire prevention specialist with the province, said showers forecast for Thursday would probably only amount to 20 millimetres at best, not enough to wipe out the fires or do much to change the tinder dry conditions.</p><p>New Brunswick is suffering one of its worst dry spells since 1986. The forecast for Moncton on Tuesday is a sweltering high of 36 C, with a humidex reading making it feel like 41 C.</p><p>Given the searing temperatures and dry conditions, with the region in the midst of a four-day heat wave, New Brunswick has asked other places for help.</p><p>It has applied through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre for 60 Type 1 firefighters, trained personnel who specialize in combatting wildfires in grueling conditions, to supplement the 100 or so that New Brunswick has already deployed.</p><p>John Herron, the minister of natural resources, said Nova Scotia had already agreed to send 20 firefighters, while Prince Edward Island is sending a strike team of five. Neighbouring Maine has also promised five firefighters.</p><p>Herron said firefighters were struggling to control the Oldfield Road fire but they were hoping to steer it in the right direction, keeping it away from homes, camps and businesses.</p><p>\u201cWe want to be on our front foot as much as possible, to be as proactive as we can,\u201d Herron said. \u201cFor the first time, I believe ever, we\u2019ve asked for boots on the ground from our neighbours.\u201d</p><p>New Brunswick has sent firefighters to other provinces many times in the past, as it has a sizeable arsenal of highly trained personnel.</p><p>This time, however, the province is seeking help.</p><p>It is repurposing two air attack helicopters it had on lease to carry water buckets that will arrive Monday evening.</p><p>\u201cThose aerial assets are incredibly precise,\u201d he said.</p><p>They will join Forest Protection Limited\u2019s Air Tractor AT-802s, the world\u2019s largest single-engine air tanker, based out of Fredericton and four water bombers owned and operated by J.D. Irving, Limited, the province\u2019s biggest timber firm.</p><p>The province has also asked for two additional CL-415 planes, large super-scooper water bombers. Two, based out of Baie-Comeau, Que., have already been dumping water on the Oldsfield and Irishtown fires.</p><p>\u201cThey will be very helpful as we aim to get ahead of the Oldfield fire,\u201d he said.</p><p>This time, however, the province is seeking help.</p><p>It is repurposing two air attack helicopters it had on lease to carry water buckets that will arrive Monday evening.</p><p>\u201cThose aerial assets are incredibly precise,\u201d he said.</p><p>They will join Forest Protection Limited\u2019s Air Tractor AT-802s, the world\u2019s largest single-engine air tanker, based out of Fredericton and four water bombers owned and operated by J.D.

So please, if you don\u2019t need to be out, don\u2019t be out on the roads and trails where emergency responders need to get access.\u201d</p><p>She said the best source of information was New Brunswick\u2019s Fire Watch page, which has a dashboard and fire activity report, or the province\u2019s or emergency measures organization\u2019s social media channels.</p><p>She warned people not to rely overly on other social media, as officials have already noticed disinformation circulating on Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, and TikTok.</p><p>Drones are also not permitted in wildfire areas, even though several have been flown in to take dramatic pictures and video.</p><p>Collet asked people to respect the law and not fly the devices into restricted airspace, to avoid any accidents.</p><p>As of Sunday, people have been banned from going into provincial Crown land that includes about half of New Brunswick\u2019s geography. Officials are also encouraging people to say out of private woodland. Last week, forestry operations were halted to avoid any machinery sparks from accidentally setting a blaze.</p><p>They also want people to rethink camping plans. A province wide ban on open fires remains in place. So far, Holt said, two people had been fined for ignoring the fire ban, but she didn\u2019t have details.</p><p>The premier said she could understand people becoming frustrated not being able to go hiking or fishing at the peak of summer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something we all love to do as New Brunswickers, to get out into the woods and to do that with our family and friends and pets and otherwise. The notion that me going for a walk in the woods is going to cause a fire, I can understand why people think that that\u2019s ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cBut the reality is it\u2019s not that you may cause a fire. If you\u2019re out there walking in the woods and you break your leg, we\u2019re not going to come and get you because we have emergency responders that are out focused on a fire that\u2019s threatening the lives of New Brunswickers. And if you take your boat out fishing on a pond on Crown land and capsize, we\u2019re not going to be able to come and help you.\u201d</p><p>The province\u2019s public fires dashboard showed Tuesday morning there have been 238 fires for the total year with 1,298.2 hectares being burned. That\u2019s in comparison to 218 fires in the same timeframe last year with 185.5 hectares lost.</p><p>Tom Jenicek, who lives in a subdivision off Irishtown Road, watched the smoke and the waterbombers from his back porch Sunday and Monday. While the fire was several kilometres away and the chance of being told to evacuate seemed minimal, he said it was unnerving.</p><p>He estimated the fire was half way between his home and the Caledonia Industrial Park, which is home to many businesses.</p><p>\u201cIf the winds start pushing northward, they are going to push that fire right toward us, and at that point we\u2019re going to get very nervous,\u201d Jenicek said Monday morning.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe spent the morning packing important documents and old photographs and irreplaceable things. I\u2019ve also taken video of all the rooms in my home for insurance. You have to think of the worst-case scenario, and in this case that would be that the fire reaches us. At that point, we bolt and take whatever possessions we can grab.\u201d</p><p>While forest fires are common in many places, it is rare that this type of blaze affects Moncton.</p><p>\u201cEverybody here is paying very close attention to what\u2019s happening here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ernest Robichaud is mayor of the Alnwick rural community, where the Oldfield Road fire is located. Although he said relatively few homes or businesses are near the fire or in its path, Robichaud acknowledged some homes in its vicinity have been evacuated, and several other neighbours have been placed on standby in case the fire moves in their direction.</p><p>\u201cFirefighters are trying to steer the fire away from people\u2019s houses,\u201d said Robichaud, who lives in Tabusintac. \u201cIf they can keep that up, it would be God\u2019s blessing.\"</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to feel the pinch. The smoke in the air here makes it feel like we\u2019re in the middle of it. It was just like fog when I woke up this morning. We\u2019re trying to dot every I and cross every T in case the fire or air quality get worse or the fire comes our way.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4348fc489b17468292c2c0155ff7c431</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGN-7HV3-S0X2-W2NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1742\"/><timeReceived>10:54 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 12, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A small fire that had sparked up seven kilometres northeast of the municipality was declared out on Sunday, according to Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) agency. Another blaze that continues to burn about six kilometres southwest of Armstrong in the area of Badwater Lake was classified as being under control, after it had grown in size to about three hectares, the agency said. </p><p>What caused the fires wasn't provided, although human activity is often a factor at this time of year. According to a regional AFFES bulletin issued on Sunday night, there were six active fires in the Northwest, with two considered under control and four not under control. \"The wildland fire hazard is mainly high across the (region),\" the bulletin said. \"The hazard is extreme along the Minnesota border from Rainy River to Quetico Park.\" It added: \"Areas of Thunder Bay and Greenstone feature low to moderate hazard conditions.\" Firefighters were able on the weekend to make progress on a larger fire about 60 kilometres northwest of Kenora, due to \"favourable winds and lower fire behaviour.\" About a dozen provincial fire-ranger crews have been assigned to Kenora Fire 14, which had grown to just over 1,000 hectares as of late Sunday. According to Environment Canada's website, Thunder Bay could see some rain between Wednesday and Saturday following two days of sunny skies and above-normal temperatures. The mercury is to climb to 24 C in Thunder Bay today, about eight degrees warmer than normal for the city at this time of year. Last week, Conmee, Gillies, Neebing, O'Connor and Oliver Paipoonge declared municipal fire bans in their communities to prevent the start of grass fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d58adc4785744717913fa246d2f57b94</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FT7-WWD3-RS1F-R448-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"310\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 13, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

However, the department anticipates that the fire will cross the highway and move toward Banting Memorial park Sunday evening into overnight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The department is now reporting that the fire is\u00a0about 1,700 hectares in size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture has wildfire suppression ground resources, four water bombers, a bird dog aircraft and other crews\u00a0working to put out the fire. The province's Emergency Operations Centre is actively monitoring the situation and emergency management partners\u00a0are responding.\u00a0</p><p>\"Updates on conditions, resources and assistance will be made available continuously throughout this evolving situation,\" says the advisory.\u00a0</p><p>In the meantime, an evacuation order remains for Musgrave\u00a0Harbour and Banting Memorial Park.\u00a0</p><p>In a provincial update provided at noon Sunday, Jamie Chippett, the deputy minister of the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture, said that when the fire was detected at 8\u00a0p.m. Saturday evening, it was eight\u00a0kilometres from the community.</p><p>\"It is at a very high rank, a Rank 5 in technical terms;\u00a0[that means it's] 'very active,'\" said Chippett.\u00a0</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador uses the international ranking scale for fire behaviour, meaning a Rank 5 indicates an extremely vigorous surface fire. That scale only goes to 6.</p><p>\"The community would be seeing lots of smoke,\" said Chippett. \"We do have weather conditions with a wind that is 40 gusting to 50 west-southwest, which unfortunately puts the community directly in the line of the fire.\"</p><p>While tomorrow's winds are supposed to be slightly lighter, Chippett said they'll still be in the direction of the community. Forecasts are also saying that there may be some precipitation during the evening.\u00a0</p><p>\"The first real relief is on Tuesday when we expect cooler temperatures, different wind direction and potentially some significant precipitation,\" said Chippett.\u00a0</p><p>Evacuees registering with Red Cross</p><p>Musgrave Harbour evacuees were advised to go to a reception centre in Gander at the Steele Memorial Centre on 155 Airport Boulevard, where the Canadian Red Cross will be registering people.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Minister of Justice and Public Safety John Haggie asked that everyone affected by the evacuation order register with the Red Cross. And if they are not intending to go to the centre in Gander, evacuees should still call 709-729-0921 to register.</p><p>\"It's important that we have that information so we can help you out even if you don't use the Steel Centre itself,\" said Haggie.</p><p>There is also now a\u00a0road block at the entrance to Aspen Cove and Banting Memorial Park\u00a0stationed by\u00a0Royal Newfoundland Constabulary and Ground Search and Rescue.</p><p>The province says that Route 330 may need to be closed on short notice\u00a0but that\u00a0it will provide an update if\u00a0required.\u00a0</p><p>The minister also asked that people not fly drones,\u00a0as they would prevent water bombers from flying in the area.\u00a0</p><p>\"Drones in the air means no water bombers in the air,\" said Haggie. \"That is our main weapon during the daylight hours of containing forest fires like this. So unauthorized drone use is actually a criminal offence.\"</p><p>Residents attempting to evacuate\u00a0without vehicles were advised to go to the Musgrave Harbour fire department to avail of busing transportation, and to be brought to Gander, said\u00a0Town Clerk Amber Littlejohn, Sunday morning.\u00a0</p><p>Littlejohn is also asked\u00a0that residents drive safely, and tell friends and family where they are.</p><p>She also told CBC that the community was\u00a0\"drenched with smoke.\"</p><p>The town fire department worked on putting out the fire overnight, said Littlejohn, who added that while they couldn't see the fire from the town, she could see the crews working to fight it.</p><p>\"We have a water bomber going back and forth. He's picking up water from a designated area in the ocean there, off our beach,\" she said.</p><p>Musgrave Harbour's town council declared a state of emergency Sunday morning, according to a letter released on social media.\u00a0</p><p>The letter states that the council has determined that the wildfire poses a serious safety risk to residents and property within the town.\u00a0</p><p>Health supports in place</p><p>Environment Canada has an air quality warning in place for\u00a0Musgrave Harbour and the vicinity due to high levels of smoke from the fire.\u00a0</p><p>As of 6:52 p.m., the province advised\u00a0that the air quality in Gander is considered \"moderate risk\" and Grand Falls-Windsor\u00a0is \"low risk.\"</p><p>\"Forest fires can increase air pollution levels. Forest fire smoke contains particles and pollutants that can harm your health,\" writes the province in the advisory.</p><p>Haggie says the health authority has extra support in place at the James Paton Memorial Regional Health Centre in Gander, for both physical and mental health needs.\u00a0</p><p>He also advises\u00a0residents to monitor official channels for updates.\u00a0</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fires continue across the province</emphasis></p><p/><p>Minister of Justice and Public Safety John Haggie\u00a0called the wildfire\u00a0\"a significant and serious issue,\" and says\u00a0air quality is a\u00a0concern for firefighters.\u00a0</p><p>As\u00a0wildfire still rages out of control in Chance Harbour as well, Haggie says \"this is a really busy fire season for the province and certainly for the island at the moment.\"\u00a0</p><p>A previous air quality warning on the Bonavista peninsula, due to the fire near Chance Harbour, was lifted this morning.</p><p>According to the Active Wildfire Dashboard, the Chance Harbour\u00a0fire remains at\u00a0an estimated\u00a01,660 hectares and is\u00a0still considered out of control.</p><p>Provincial Fire Duty Officer Wesley Morgan says the wind has been helping keep the fire away from the nearby towns of Jamestown and Winter Brook.</p><p>In an 11\u00a0a.m. update, the forestry department said that Chance Harbour residents can also expect to see significant smoke from the southern end of the fire.\u00a0</p><p>Three helicopters will continue to work the fire throughout the day, and ground crews will be deployed once it is safe to do so.\u00a0</p><p>Ground crews are still working on the wildfires at Nine Island Pond and Northwest Brook.</p><p>At this time, Haggie says the province's fire suppression resources are adequate to deal with the current situation. But if things get worse, the province will look at asking other provinces for help.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Province-wide fire ban in effect</emphasis></p><p/><p>A fire ban is still in place across the entire province today. The province is reminding residents that open fires are still not permitted.\u00a0</p><p>Haggie also wanted to remind people to be careful with cigarette butts.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is surprising the number of people who just casually toss them out of the window on the highway and we've seen that cause trouble before,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

(NAM or the Company) is pleased to update our shareholders and interested parties about the completion of Companys 2025 exploration program at its 100% owned Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project. The project is located in southeast Alaska, about 65 km south of the community of Glenallen and about 265 km east of Anchorage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Figure 1. Location of Alaska Genesis Project</p><p>Highlights of the Genesis project are listed below: //st * The Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is 100% owned by New Age Metals. * The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Gensis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska. * The project is located within 3 km of the all-season paved Richardson highway and a high-capacity electric power line. * The Genesis property comprises 4,144 hectares of State of Alaska mining claims. * Two separate settings of magmatic reef-style mineralization occur: chromate-hosted Platinum Group Metals (PGM) returning up to 2.4 g/t palladium (Pd) and 2.4 g/t platinum (Pt); and nickel-copper (Ni-Cu)-bearing sulphide mineralization with values up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu. * Reef-style cumulate mineralization is open to the west, east, north and at depth. * Reef-style mineralization has been identified in outcrop for 2,000 metres along strike, with a 40-metre true thickness. * Known PGM mineralization covers a distance of 9 km across the prospect. The target areas have never been drilled. A Technical Report is available.</p><p>Genesis 2025 Exploration Program</p><p>In July, the Company engaged Alaska Earth Sciences (AES) of Anchorage, Alaska, to complete a detailed mapping, sampling, and prospecting program at the Sheep Hill area, focusing on follow-up of Copper (Cu) anomalies identified in sediment samples collected by Aurora Geosciences Ltd (AGL) during their 2021 field season. Additional objectives include following the recommendations outlined in 2018 Technical Report by Curtis J. Freeman which was reaffirmed in AGLs 2021 report.</p><p>AES is completing a six-day, four person field program based out of the Tonsina River Lodge, located approximately eight miles northwest of Sheep Hill project area. The site will be accessed via ATV along roughly 11 miles of maintained trails, identified through satellite imagery and confirmed during a recent aerial reconnaissance. Detailed geological mapping will be conducted at 1:1,000 and 1:2,000 scales, depending on outcrop availability and terrain complexity. Litho-geochemical sampling will follow a 100 m x 100 m grid where applicable, while targeted grab rock and sediment sampling will focus on areas of visible mineralization and/or pXRF (portable x-ray fluorescence) anomalies. A further announcement will follow when assays have been processed.</p><p>Figure 2.

The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Antimony-Gold Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, and pending results, Phase 2 is slated to begin in the Fall of 2025.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and junior mining companies through to production</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Opt-in List</p><p>If you have not done so already, we encourage you to sign up on our website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url>) to receive our updated news.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors</p><p>Harry Barr</p><p>Harry G.

Walter Colquhoun Grant planted a European perennial shrub on his farm on T'Sou-ke Nation's traditional territory (Sooke).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He thought the shrub \u2014 Cytisus scorparius in Latin \u2014 would bring back nostalgia of his Scottish homeland, covered with hills of yellow flowers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One-hundred and seventy-five years later, this shrub is now one of the most notorious invasive species on Vancouver Island known colloquially as Scotch broom. Vast areas of the Island are covered in this plant, exhibiting what a changed landscape can look like if invasive plants are allowed to spread and take over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It competes with native plants, disrupts streams and has no known natural predators. It can also live up to 25 years and produces seeds that can survive in the soil for 30 years.</p><p>Scotch broom is also extremely flammable, leading to growing concern as the climate changes and Earth warms.</p><p>Luckily, one Vancouver Island-wide organization has been working for nearly two decades to decrease the abundance of Scotch broom in local areas, and an invasive species expert says groups such as these, along with other forms of traditional land management that draw on Indigenous knowledge, give him hope that disastrous wildfires sparked by broom can be mitigated or avoided.</p><p>Invasive plants and wildfire: a \u2018sleeping giant'</p><p>Hunter Jarratt is an ecological restoration consultant based in the Nanaimo area, and is more famously known as the Invasive Species Guy. He told The Discourse that Scotch broom has a high oil content, so it's flammable even while it's still green and alive.</p><p>\"I'm about six feet tall, so if you have a pile that's as tall as me the flames would easily grow to three or four times that in a matter of minutes \u2014 seconds, even,\" he said, adding that he hopes Vancouver Island doesn't see a fire similar to the one in 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Hawaii, and was amplified due to invasive grasses.</p><p>The grasses were left over from sugar cane plantations and, similarly to broom, would crowd out native species. According to reporting from the Washington Post, powerlines fell on the fields of grass in 2023 leading to a disastrous wildfire that killed 102 people.</p><p>\"It's pretty concerning, especially the ecosystems that have grasslands that are a mix of these dry grasses, Scotch brooms and maybe some other shrubs in there too. There's just so much fuel in those places that it's a sleeping giant,\" Jarratt said.</p><p>Jarratt also explained how invasive species can fuel fires by changing the natural fire cycle of an ecosystem. This is referred to as the invasive plant/fire cycle.</p><p>These new invaders, he explained, will add fuel to the ecosystem so more intense and severe fires will occur. After the fire, because those species were already present in that ecosystem, they will be the first to colonize and repopulate those sites.</p><p>Jarratt said the invasive plants push out native species that can't adapt quickly, taking advantage of sunlight and nutrients. The increase in invasive species makes the ecosystem less resilient, creating a monoculture and setting the stage for another fire.</p><p>This is all amplified by climate change and increasingly common drought conditions, he added.</p><p>\"It's leading to a pretty rapid instability of an ecosystem. It's invade, burn, repeat over and over again. So it's quite concerning.\"</p><p>Jarratt said the undermining of Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship is another big contributor to the spread of invasive species.</p><p>The colonial government has historically put forth policies of fire suppression, such as the 1874 Bush Fire Act that banned Indigenous cultural burning. Research shows these policies have led to a build-up of forest fire fuels, increased fire risk, decreased forest resilience and, in turn, more out-of-control wildfires.</p><p>\"As much as fire is scary, not all fire is bad,\" Jarratt said, adding that ecosystems such as the Garry oak ecosystem traditionally relied on regular, low-intensity ground fires to limit the spread of competing tree species.</p><p>\"That's one thing I always like to talk about with this kind of conversation with burning and with Scotch broom is the Garry oak ecosystem, which there is way less of in the Comox Valley now,\" Jarratt said.</p><p>Busting broom</p><p>Jarratt said he still sees opportunities for people to learn how to manage invasive species in their areas.</p><p>\"There's been a lot of effort to control it,\" he said.</p><p>\"People who have farmland and natural areas on their land, as long as you're doing your part to keep invasive species in check, I think we'd be in a much better position.\"</p><p>One of the organizations that inspired Jarratt to learn more about invasive species involves a group of committed people who are determined to get rid of as much invasive Scotch broom as possible: The Broombusters. Bev Agur has been committed to cutting down broom since 2010, when she became involved.</p><p>The organization that was founded in 2006 by Joanne Sales, who noticed a lot of Scotch broom growing near her blueberry farm in Coombs. Since then, this volunteer-run organization has expanded all across Vancouver Island, including in the Comox Valley, Cowichan Valley and Nanaimo.</p><p>\"My husband and I moved out to the Comox Valley in 2009 from Alberta, and we didn't really know anything about broom,\" Agur said.</p><p>She has been cutting broom with the organization since 2010, and is now the area organizer for the Comox Valley's division of Broombusters. For six days a week, for six weeks of the year when broom is in season, the group of Broombusters goes out to cut it down.</p><p>Like Jarratt, she's learned how much of a fire risk it is.</p><p>\"If there's broom that's growing under a powerline \u2026 if a wildfire gets there, it'll just take off,\" she said.</p><p>Agur said the summer is not the best time to cut broom, because if it is cut and sits and dries out, it is a fire risk.</p><p>\"And the problem is it's full of seed pods, so you run the risk of spreading those around,\" she said.</p><p>Those who are curious to learn about Comox Valley broom cutting can keep their eyes out for when to join in the spring. She added that there is a video on the organization's website that explains how to cut broom properly.</p><p>\"We have lots of tools so people could show up and cut broom with us,\" she said. \"I suggest they bring some work gloves or gardening gloves, and wear dirty shoes and old clothes, because often broom is growing around blackberries and roses.\"</p><p>Controlling the fire</p><p>Jarratt said getting involved with invasive species control and learning more about controlled burning (also known as prescribed burning) are some of the best ways to manage invasive species and fire risk.</p><p>Controlled burning helps reduce the amount of fuel load \u2014 what is available to burn in an area. After years go by, the fuel builds up on the ground as vegetation grows and falls to the forest floor and then is available to burn again, Jarratt explained. He also said some plant species such as Lodgepole pine are dependent on fire, so they won't germinate unless there is a fire.</p><p>Prescribed burns are often lighter and less hot as well, he said. They're small enough to support germination but not big enough that it burns the whole ecosystem down.</p><p>On the south Island, Jarratt pointed to biologist James Miskelly who does prescribed burns at Rocky Point, home to a Garry oak ecosystem which has historically relied on controlled burning to keep it healthy.</p><p>In B.C.'s southern interior, known for its dry landscape and frequent wildfires, groups such as the Salish Fire Keepers Society and Ntityix Resources have taken up Indigenous-led controlled burning, something that was suppressed from colonialism after being practiced for millennia.</p><p>\"I feel like this is going to be an increasingly important factor as more areas evidently burn on Vancouver Island in the future,\" he said.</p><p>\"Especially all these hilly ecosystems that have huge fuel loads that have built up over many, many, many years, but are now also invaded by these highly flammable species like Scotch broom.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 Vancouver Island Free Daily</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-news20250724PVC4747242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBJ-D3N3-RSF8-J38D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.</p><p>As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.</p><p>Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.</p><p>Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.</p><p>Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.</p><p>Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.</p><p>\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.</p><p>The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.</p><p>\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d</p><p>The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.</p><p>\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

And this is combined with a possibility for drier conditions as well - two elements essentially that are not favourable,\" said Jennifer Smith, the national warning preparedness meteorologist with the Meteorological Service of Canada at Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Temperatures will be about a degree or two above normal across the country through August, although the risk of wildfires remains highest in central and western provinces and territories, modelling by Environment and Climate Change Canada suggests.</p><p>Alex Crawford, an assistant professor in the department of environment and geography at the University of Manitoba, said forecasts show the confidence on those above-normal temperatures, while high across the province, is especially high in northern Manitoba.</p><p>But other elements of the summer forecast that could affect wildfire risk are generally harder to predict accurately.</p><p>For example, Crawford said\u00a0\"we really can't say anything confidently about\" precipitation this summer, while predicting the amount of fires that start from lightning from thunderstorms is\u00a0\"a fool's errand.\"</p><p>Another factor Crawford said could be worthwhile trying to predict is wind, which Environment and Climate Change Canada doesn't present in its seasonal forecasts.</p><p>\"Maybe in the future they will start doing that,\" he said. \"It's totally feasible. Are we there yet? No. The fact that our precipitation forecasts seasonally are so bad is a good indication that we still have a lot of work to do.\"</p><p>Smith said although the federal agency's forecasts don't give detail on things like wind and lightning, it's something to be mindful of.</p><p>\"Summer is storm season - that's when you do get all of the lightning activity,\" she said.</p><p>Manitoba has recently had some rain in certain parts of the province, but Natural Resources and Indigenous Futures Minister Ian Bushie warned Thursday the province likely isn't out of the woods yet when it comes to wildfire season.</p><p>\"Actually, I would almost hazard to say we're not even in the height of our wildfire season yet. So as we go on, I'm encouraging Manitobans to be very fire smart and vigilant, as we talk about human starts,\" Bushie said at a news conference.\u00a0</p><p>As of Friday,\u00a0provincial wildfire data showed\u00a0there were 21 fires burning across Manitoba, with seven out of control. The total number of fires to date was 117, with nine of them starting from natural causes, 103 being caused by people and five under investigation.</p><p>The update comes in a Canadian wildfire season shaping up to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/fire-season-2025-1.7559565\">the second-worst on record</url>, federal officials said Thursday.</p><p>\"We are expecting a hot and dry summer, and definitely leading to a forecast of increased fire danger conditions for much of western and northern Canada,\" Michael Norton, director general of the Northern Forestry Centre with Natural Resources Canada, said during a government technical briefing in Ottawa.</p><p>Wildfires have scorched 3.7 million hectares across the country so far -\u00a0six times the area of Prince Edward Island. The blazes have consumed about 800,000 hectares on average annually since 2014. About 76 per cent of the total area burned in Canada is in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.</p><p>Norton said while the start of wildfire season was \"relatively normal\" in early spring, the forest fire situation rapidly worsened over the past few weeks - driven by higher-than-average temperatures, especially across the west, with low accumulated precipitation on top of already dry conditions.</p><p>Wildfires in Manitoba have forced thousands of people out of their homes this season, although it was announced earlier this week that some would\u00a0slowly be\u00a0allowed to return to their communities starting this weekend.</p><p>Despite that progress, the province on Friday was deemed to be at a high fire danger level, with the potential for new blazes due to lightning and human cases continuing, the government said in a news release.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadamanitobasummerweatherforecastwildfirerisk17561163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G23-25R3-RT3N-G287-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

(TSX.V: NAM; OTCQB: NMTLF; FSE: P7J.F) (\"NAM\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to update our shareholders and interested parties about the completion of Company's 2025 exploration program at its 100% owned Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project. The project is located in southeast Alaska, about 65 km south of the community of Glenallen and about 265 km east of Anchorage.</p><p>Figure 1. Location of Alaska Genesis Project</p><p>Highlights of the Genesis project are listed below:</p><p>The Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is 100% owned by New Age Metals.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Gensis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The project is located within 3 km of the all-season paved Richardson highway and a high-capacity electric power line.</p><p>The Genesis property comprises 4,144 hectares of State of Alaska mining claims.</p><p>Two separate settings of magmatic reef-style mineralization occur: chromate-hosted Platinum Group Metals (PGM) returning up to 2.4 g/t palladium (Pd) and 2.4 g/t platinum (Pt); and nickel-copper (Ni-Cu)-bearing sulphide mineralization with values up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu.</p><p>Reef-style cumulate mineralization is open to the west, east, north and at depth.</p><p>Reef-style mineralization has been identified in outcrop for 2,000 metres along strike, with a 40-metre true thickness.</p><p>Known PGM mineralization covers a distance of 9 km across the prospect. The target areas have never been drilled. A Technical Report is available.</p><p>Genesis 2025 Exploration Program</p><p>In July, the Company engaged Alaska Earth Sciences (AES) of Anchorage, Alaska, to complete a detailed mapping, sampling, and prospecting program at the Sheep Hill area, focusing on follow-up of Copper (Cu) anomalies identified in sediment samples collected by Aurora Geosciences Ltd (AGL) during their 2021 field season. Additional objectives include following the recommendations outlined in 2018 Technical Report by Curtis J. Freeman which was reaffirmed in AGL's 2021 report.</p><p>AES is completing a six-day, four person field program based out of the Tonsina River Lodge, located approximately eight miles northwest of Sheep Hill project area. The site will be accessed via ATV along roughly 11 miles of maintained trails, identified through satellite imagery and confirmed during a recent aerial reconnaissance. Detailed geological mapping will be conducted at 1:1,000 and 1:2,000 scales, depending on outcrop availability and terrain complexity. Litho-geochemical sampling will follow a 100 m x 100 m grid where applicable, while targeted grab rock and sediment sampling will focus on areas of visible mineralization and/or pXRF (portable x-ray fluorescence) anomalies. A further announcement will follow when assays have been processed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/edacd8e69103c1cf95e265ada1b4c77b.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/edacd8e69103c1cf95e265ada1b4c77b.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Figure 2.

The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Antimony-Gold Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB.This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, and pending results, Phase 2 is slated to begin in the Fall of 2025.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and junior mining companies through to production</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Opt-in List</p><p>If you have not done so already, we encourage you to sign up on our website (about:blank) to receive our updated news.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors</p><p>\"Harry Barr\"</p><p>Harry G.

The Phayayen Tambon Administrative Organisation (TAO) informed the centre of a forest fire behind Wat Udomsuk.</p><p>It extinguished the fire that evening, after it had ravaged approximately 200 rai of forest. On January 5, the centre received an alert about another forest fire.</p><p>According to a source, the combined damage is nearly 1,000 rai of forest, with animal poaching suspected.</p><p>Forest Fires in Thailand</p><p>Forest fires in Thailand occur annually during the dry season, which lasts from December to May, with the peak occurring in February and March.</p><p>Forest fires, which are mostly surface fires, occur primarily in Mixed Deciduous Forest, Dry Dipterocarp Forest, and Forest Plantations, as well as to a lesser extent in Dry Evergreen Forest, Hill Evergreen Forest, and, on rare occasions, in some parts of the Tropical Rain Forest.</p><p>In some extremely dry areas, double burning occurs during the same season. These surface fires consume surface litter, loose debris from the forest floor, and small vegetation.</p><p>Thailand is experiencing an increase in forest fires, particularly during the dry season. Human activities such as agricultural land clearing or illegal logging are frequently the cause of these fires.</p><p>They pollute the air with harmful PM2.5 particles, which have a negative impact on health. Northern regions such as Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai frequently experience smoky haze, which disrupts daily life and tourism. These fires also harm ecosystems and wildlife, endangering biodiversity.</p><p>Efforts to prevent fires include stricter laws, awareness campaigns, and forest patrols, but enforcement remains difficult. Addressing the issue requires striking a balance between environmental protection and local economic needs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES1201202500002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DW7-MCP3-RVR2-00PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 12, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00098X3</classCode><className>CUSTOMS &amp;

about\u00a0Canadian wildfire smoke\u00a0travelling south, which they said was making it difficult for some Americans to enjoy their summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I've shaken the hands of American firefighters in northern Manitoba who are helping us out,\" said Premier Wab Kinew, whose province has endured <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/wildfire-manitoba-first-nation-1.7581444\">a deadly and devastating wildfire season</url> in which thousands of people have been forced to evacuate from their homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I would challenge these ambulance chasers in the U.S. Congress to go and do the same, and to hear how much the American firefighting heroes who are here\u00a0- how much they love\u00a0our province.\"</p><p>\"This is what turns people off politics,\" added\u00a0Kinew. \"When you've got a group of congresspeople trying to trivialize and\u00a0make hay out of a wildfire season where we've lost lives in our province.\"</p><p>A letter\u00a0signed by Republican House representatives Tom Tiffany and\u00a0Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin;\u00a0and Brad Finstad,\u00a0Michelle Fischbach, Pete Stauber and Tom Emmer of Minnesota, was\u00a0published Monday and addressed to Canada's ambassador in Washington.</p><p><emphasis

wildfire smoke filling the air to begin the summer,\"\u00a0it reads.</p><p>\"In our neck of the woods, summer months are the best time of the year to spend time outdoors recreating, enjoying time with family, and creating new memories, but this wildfire smoke makes it difficult to do all those things,\" says the complaint,\u00a0which <url normalizedValue=\"https://tiffany.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/tiffany.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/canadian_wildfire_smoke_letter.pdf\">can be read in full here</url>.</p><p>The representatives ask how the federal government plans to mitigate the wildfire smoke, attributing \"a lack of active forest management\" as a major driver of Canadian wildfires, and suggesting\u00a0that some of the fires began with arson.</p><p>\"With all the technology that we have at our disposal, both in preventing and fighting wildfires, this worrisome trend can be reversed if proper action is taken.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taken 'very seriously,' says embassy</emphasis></p><p>Research shows that climate change, largely driven by fossil fuel use, is exacerbating wildfires in both

Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>\"Canada takes the\u00a0prevention, response\u00a0and mitigation\u00a0of wildfires very seriously,\" the Canadian Embassy\u00a0said in a statement responding to the letter. \"[The letter] has been shared with the relevant Canadian agencies. We will respond in due course.\"</p><p>Foreign Minister Anita Anand also addressed the letter, in response to a CBC reporter's question on Thursday.</p><p>\"I know that the ministers responsible are going to be responding to this particular letter. I will also say that the G7 members had a unified statement on fighting forest fires,\" she said, referencing\u00a0the Kananaskis Wildfire Charter, an <url normalizedValue=\"https://g7.canada.ca/en/news-and-media/news/kananaskis-wildfire-charter/\">agreement signed</url> during the recent G7 summit that pledged co-operation on wildfire prevention and mitigation.</p><p>\"It was part of their discussion, so I know there is some unity around the leaders' table on this issue,\" said Anand.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada told CBC News via an emailed statement\u00a0that \"Canadian firefighters, first responders\u00a0and volunteers continue to work tirelessly to protect lives and property\" from the present wildfires.</p><p>The department\u00a0said it \"actively collaborates with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities\u00a0and international partners to address the impacts of wildfires.\"</p><p>CBC News has reached out to all six representatives\u00a0multiple times for an interview.

The smoke\u00a0is an air pollutant that can impact people's health, according to the B.C.

organic waste collection, that there is not much waste left,\" Marie-Andr\u00e9e Mauger said.</p><p>As a member of the city\u2019s executive committee in charge of ecological transition in Mayor

in the Northern District of New York District Court on Tuesday.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department said 34-year-old Timothy Oakes was arrested as he attempted to enter the United States on June 15.</p><p>Oakes, who is from Akwesasne which straddles the Canada-U.S. border west of Montreal, was indicted in April for conspiring with others to smuggle people from Canada into the United States,

It said the settlement did not involve an apology.</p><p>Trump\u2019s lawyer said the president had suffered \u201cmental anguish\u201d over the editing of the interview by CBS News.</p><p>Paramount and CBS rejected Trump\u2019s contention that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris sounded and had sought to get Trump's lawsuit dismissed.</p><p>There was no immediate word from the White House about the settlement.</p><p>Marner bolts for Vegas as NHL free agency opens</p><p>A star winger on the move.

However, it's still burning out of control, at around 1,100 hectares in size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire is about 600 metres from the community, but Motty said there is a sense of optimism that crews can get a better handle on it.</p><p>\"We've got decreasing winds tomorrow\u00a0...The risk is decreasing,\" Motty told CBC News Wednesday evening.\u00a0</p><p>He said 35\u00a0firefighting personnel will begin fighting\u00a0the fire on the ground at 7 a.m. Thursday morning, and additional resources have been requested.</p><p>Residents of Badger fled\u00a0the community as smoke clouded the air, and waterbombers passed overhead every few minutes.</p><p>\"It is scary, yeah,\" said Joe Roberts, who was gassing up his vehicle at a local service station before heading to Grand Falls-Windsor, about 30 kilometres east on the Trans-Canada Highway.</p><p>\"It's so unpredictable, you never know what's going to happen now,\" said Roberts of the wind.</p><p>He's one of the roughly 500 people in Badger who've been ordered to flee by the provincial government.</p><p>The evacuation notice came just a few hours before,\u00a0after the forest fire\u00a0threatened\u00a0both the town and nearby infrastructure.\u00a0</p><p>\"Nobody should refuse to leave,\" said Premier John Hogan. \"We're not making this evacuation order lightly.

About 76 per cent of the total area burned in Canada is in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.</p><p>\"While the start of the season was relatively normal in the early spring, the forest fire situation got rapidly worse over the past weeks,\" Norton said.</p><p>\"This had been driven by higher-than-average temperatures, especially across the west, with low accumulated precipitation on top of already dry conditions.\"</p><p>Modelling by Environment and Climate Change Canada suggests temperatures will be about a degree or two above normal across the country through August, though the risk of wildfires remains highest in central and western provinces and territories.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada is forecasting an extreme fire risk in southern British Columbia in July, while southwestern B.C. \u2014 including Vancouver Island \u2014 is expected to be hotter and drier than normal.</p><p>Canada has called on international aid to fight the 225 active wildfires. About 500 firefighters from the United States and Australia are helping out, while another dozen American firefighters are on their way and a federal agency is looking to request 100 more from Costa Rica.</p><p>International leaders are set to meet at the G7 summit in Alberta next week. While officials said there is little risk of fires or wildfire smoke affecting the summit, the topic of wildfires will be on the agenda.</p><p>\"One of things that will be presented at the G7 is the Kananaskis Wildfire Charter,\" federal Emergency Management Minister Eleanor Olszewski told reporters Thursday.</p><p>She said the charter addresses \"all aspects\" of wildfires, including mitigation, response and recovery. Olszewski said members of the G7 have already committed in principle to the charter.</p><p>\"There's not a doubt that wildfires affect us globally, and when we have a wildfire in one country it affects the others in terms of smoke, for example,\" she said.</p><p>\"What G7 leaders will focus on is strengthening multilateral efforts to prevent, fight, and recover from wildfires,\" said John Kirton, head of the G7 Research Group at the University of Toronto.</p><p>Kirton said the discussion at the G7 likely will focus on \"equipment interoperability\" to allow G7 members to support each other during emergencies, and the use of satellite imagery to fight wildfires.</p><p>Kirton said the topic has become \"a burning issue\" in part because wildfires in places like Los Angeles and across the Prairies show how the threat is relevant to Washington and its G7 peers.</p><p>An out-of-control wildfire near Squamish, B.C., grew to more than 55 hectares Thursday and forced the evacuation of the nearby Alice Lake Provincial Park.</p><p>The Dryden Creek wildfire has almost tripled in size and the District of Squamish says increased wind activity Wednesday afternoon led to growth along its north flank.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, rain and favourable winds Thursday helped crews keep fires at bay and allowed 7,000 residents in the La Ronge area to begin returning home. So too for 600 residents of Cranberry Portage, Man., who were notified they can return beginning Saturday morning.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Dylan Robertson in Ottawa, Brittany Hobson and Steve Lambert in Winnipeg and Brieanna Charlebois in Vancouver.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 12, 2025</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4b58d164a7994ea8a699858a96c8cd01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1N-1KH3-RT99-009J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><timeReceived>06:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 12, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
