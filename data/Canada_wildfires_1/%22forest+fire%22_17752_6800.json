Lightning is the second-leading cause with 47 per cent.</p><p>Officials were still investigating the cause of the latest fire, which remained out of control on Wednesday as it raged around Fort McMurray, a city of about 80,000 people located 435 kilometres northeast of Edmonton.</p><p>However, Flanagan said weather conditions in Western Canada have been perfect for wildfires as the warm, dry winter has led to an abundance of dead, dry leaves and wood ready to light up.</p><p>\"It's really extreme conditions,\" he said, adding that the low humidity and lack of green vegetation combined with windy conditions contributed to the incredibly intense fire in the northern Alberta city.</p><p>\"Spring fires are common after the snow melts and before things green up and get lush,\" Flanagan said. \"There is a two- or three-week window where they occur.\"</p><p>He said the biggest variable at this point is the wind, which gusted up to 40 km/h on Tuesday, the day the city was evacuated.</p><p>Scientists at Natural Resources Canada predict forest fires will double within 50 to 100 years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2016050537966907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JPJ-D6T1-JDV5-F4PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The Ore Hill property is located within an area clause that surrounded the Jersey-Emerald lead-zinc-tungsten property and was therefore transferred to Apex in compliance with the terms of the Jersey Property Agreement which was terminated on October 1, 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The property was one of the highlights for Margaux's work in 2018. At Ore Hill, a gold soil anomaly, 1,500 m long by up to 150 m wide is known from previous exploration work.

A drill program planned for 2018 could not be completed due to forest fire conditions.</p><p>The Ore Hill property is located 5 km east of the Jersey Mine in the southern portion of the Sheep Creek Gold District and covers the historically known Ore Hill, Summit and Bonanza occurrences. There are two known styles of mineralization on the Ore Hill property; narrow high-grade gold (plus silver, lead and zinc) bearing veins occur within limestone; and a gold-bearing crackle zone, up to 10 m wide, associated with a north-northeast-trending fault zone and geological contact. There is limited historical production from the Ore Hill property, as follows: Summit: 1,205 tons averaging 0.72 oz/t Au, 1.01 oz/t Ag, 1.25% Pb, 1.18% Zn and Ore Hill: 2,470 tons averaging 1.15 oz/t Au, 2.19 oz/t Ag, 3.58% Pb, 3.37% Zn (BC Minfile</p><p>For further information on Apex's projects, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.apxresources.com\">www.apxresources.com</url>.</p><p>Arthur G.

On Saturday night they arrived at their cottage in Mattawa, Ont., near North Bay. With their house burned and no time to pack their possessions, this week the Woods are buying food and clothes to get through the present, they told the Independent.</p><p>Sunday was their 34th anniversary, and both feel lucky to be alive together.</p><p>\"We were right there, we watched it. We ran from it,\" Bob said.</p><p>The fire spread quickly into their subdivision on the Fort McMurray outskirts, where they lived in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood - the first hit by the incoming forest fire on May 3.</p><p>Donna had just finished a shift with Shell Oil. Bob also works in the oil industry and was sleeping after a night shift. \"She called me out of bed around 2 p.m. ... she was very very excited to say the least,\" Bob recalled. \"Out the door, the smoke is just billowing through our neighbourhood. People are evacuating.\"</p><p>Black smoke filled the air, and Bob began telling some neighbours to pack quickly. Within a minute, there was no more time. He could see flames in the nearby forest.</p><p>\"Then the bush line lit up. Like instant. You could hear the roar of the fire,\" Bob said. The fire sounded like a jet engine. He ran to get the neighbours, urging them into their vehicles. The first house in the neighbourhood was now burning and the flames quickly spread.</p><p>\"That's when the wind hit us, and it must have lit the remainder of the houses,\" Bob remembered. \"It was like blowing out birthday candles in reverse.\"</p><p>\"I was shaking so bad that I thought I was going to explode\" Donna remembered.</p><p>The Woods left with almost nothing - Bob had only a pair of shorts, a t-shirt and sandals while Donna managed to grab one sock before they had to flee.</p><p>As the Woods pulled out of their driveway, burning tree limbs began to fall and set nearby lawns ablaze.</p><p>Turning onto a main road, they found total gridlock. Highway 63 was also jammed but provided the lone route out of Fort McMurray. Bob ended up driving through a burning trailer park with near-zero visibility to find a way out of town, picking up a stranger who needed a lift, and later fueled up from a co-worker's stash in a safer part of the city.</p><p>They finally arrived in Edmonton after an ordeal that lasted roughly 16 hours.</p><p>\"Our story is only one of 80,000... Everyone, bar none, is traumatized. And I don't say that lightly,\" Bob said, noting that he has had trouble sleeping and eating since the fire.</p><p>In Edmonton, evacuees gathered to talk and grieve. \"Everyone wanted to tell their stories, and we all listened to each other and we all cried,\" he said. \"No shortage of tears.\"</p><p>Other people with connections to Wilmot Township also joined the Fort McMurray evacuation last week: one was Casey Davidson, formerly of Plattsville. She and her boyfriend left the city with nothing but the clothes on their backs, a bag of chips and some ladies speed stick. They were in limbo the days after the fire and also trying to find Davidson's dog, which had been rescued by a stranger.</p><p>Bob drove the Woods out through the smoke and flames, but he and Donna said it was their teamwork that saved them. Their neighbourhood of Beacon Hill was hit hard and lost an estimated 70 per cent of its homes, so things could have gone very badly.</p><p>\"The hero was Donna. Donna woke me up in the knick of time,\" Bob said, because he might not have woken up in time before their house burned. \"If Donna hadn't been there, I would have been the fatality.\"</p><p>\"We did not want to leave our Fort McMurray behind... but you need to do something. You can't just sit there and dwell,\" Donna said.</p><p>They will go back to work and eventually rebuild, Bob added. Fort McMurray is a strong community that looks out for each other, he said.</p><p>\"It's a little different mentality there than anywhere else you've ever been. We're all in it together.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2016051138047355</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JS8-6331-F197-54SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Authorities battling a forest fire in Canada looked to Mother Nature for help, as cooling temperatures and rain slowed the spread of the blaze that had forced the evacuation of an entire city.There was more good news too, with the amount of land charred less than originally feared and the last of 25,000 people trapped north of Fort McMurray in Alberta province safely evacuated in road convoys through the ruined oil city. Oil facilities have escaped major damage, officials said, and there have been no fatalities directly linked to the blaze.Alberta premier Rachel Notley and other officials said the fires raging for days around Fort McMurray were moving \"much, much more slowly\" thanks to a bit of rain and cooler temperatures.Authorities had worried the fire could spread east to Saskatchewan province, but Notley said that had not happened yet. </p><p>The fire's eastern edge was 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Saskatchewan and estimates of the area destroyed were lowered from 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles) to about 1,600 square kilometers.The ruthless blaze, fanned by high winds and fueled by tinder-dry conditions, devastated Fort McMurray and the region around it. The city was home to 100,000 until it was evacuated last week as flames burned homes to the ground amid scenes of panic and mass exodus.Chad Morrison, senior wildfire manager for Alberta, said Sunday that favorable weather conditions and the hard work of about 500 firefighters had contained most fire lines in Fort McMurray.The threat to oil-sand mines north of the city had also diminished, at least for now, he said. Morrison said fire lines had moved away from the work sites of Nexen, a unit of the Chinese group CNOOC, after inflicting only minor damage. Work sites of the Suncor petroleum group, which suspended operations in the area, had also been spared. The company said Sunday it had moved 10,000 people including employees, their families and local residents to safety.- 'The beast' -Morrison said firefighters hoped rains and cooler temperatures predicted for Monday and winds from the west, gusting up to 60 kilometers per hour (35 mph), would keep the flames away from the petroleum work camps in coming days. Even as fellow Canadians rally to provide succor and support, thousands of evacuees are coming to terms with the likelihood that they will be unable to see their homes anytime soon -- assuming the dwellings are still standing.Hundreds of firefighters, exhausted and demoralized after days vainly battling a blaze they grimly refer to as \"the beast,\" acknowledged that they will probably have to wait for the fire to burn itself out. The Alberta oil sands are a vital part of the regional economy.Huge swaths of forest and brush, as well as whole neighborhoods of the city, have been turned to ash.Firefighters are concentrating on saving vital infrastructure including telecommunications, electric grids, gas and water lines. Rescue crews and police have been guarding the city, but it will be days before workers can begin clearing damaged or destroyed structures and residents can begin to move back into areas spared by the inferno.Notley said late Saturday that gas lines had been cut, the electric grid damaged and a large part of the city had neither electricity nor drinkable water.\"There's a great deal of hazardous material to be cleaned up, and many other things to be done before the city is safe for families to go home,\" she said.Most of the 100,000 evacuees have found temporary shelter with friends or family, but the government is working furiously to provide accommodations for the others. - 'We're safe' -In Lac La Biche, the first big town south of the forbidden zone, cases of mineral water, clothes and food provided by the Red Cross or donated by fellow Canadians are being distributed by volunteers. \"It's just amazing to see what's been done. We're overwhelmed, everybody's overwhelmed with how much the whole country has supported us,\" said Sarah, who evacuated with her family without knowing where they would end up. \"I've said to my daughter the whole way up here, the most important thing is that we're here, we're safe, and everything else is just stuff,\" she told AFP.Notley said large numbers of evacuees could be housed for now in university dormitories in Edmonton or Calgary -- students left days ago when their spring term ended. Across the province, more than 1,400 firefighters, about 133 helicopters, 200 pieces of heavy equipment and more than 27 air tankers are battling 43 separate blazes.Reduced output by Alberta's oil producers -- down by a million barrels a day -- contributed to a rise in crude prices in trading Monday in Asia. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031462776475022251761900220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JR7-RNY1-F03R-N24V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><timeReceived>6:47 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 9, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0008CJZ</classCode><className>CHINA NATIONAL OFFSHORE OIL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS211112 NATURAL GAS LIQUID EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS211111 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp; NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001925</classCode><className>BUSINESS OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009GJZ</classCode><className>OIL SANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FBJ</classCode><className>PETROLEUM PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001240</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And Trump said Comey's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state would \"go down as one of the worst 'botch jobs' of history.\"</p><p>Trump fired Comey in May 2017 in an act that has been under scrutiny by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.</p><p>Trump's tirade came in response to news stories Thursday on leaked copies of \"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership,\" a 304-page tell-all by Comey that describes Trump's presidency as a \"forest fire\" and portrays the president as an ego-driven congenital liar.</p><p>Among the many revelations is that Trump fixated on unconfirmed allegations in a widely circulated intelligence dossier that Russians had filmed him interacting with prostitutes in Moscow in 2013.</p><p>In attempt to blunt the impact of the new book, the Republican National Committee is waging a widespread campaign to undercut Comey's credibility, including a new website that dubs the former FBI director as \"Lyin' Comey.\"</p><p>The RNC effort was launched in advance of a media blitz by Comey that began Friday morning as ABC News aired segments of a longer interview scheduled for Sunday night. During the segment, Comey said he didn't know whether to believe Trump's denial that he had spent time with prostitutes in Moscow.</p><p>\"I honestly thought these words would never come out of my mouth, but I don't know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. It's possible, but I don't know,\" Comey told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>Some of the early news coverage of Comey's memoir has made a mockery of Trump, including the cover of Friday's Daily News in New York. It's lead headline is \"PEE BRAIN!\" - a reference to unconfirmed allegations in the dossier that Trump had watched prostitutes urinate on themselves in a Moscow hotel suite.</p><p>In the book, Comey also writes of some of Trump's physical attributes in an unflattering way.</p><p>\"His face appeared slightly orange,\" Comey writes, \"with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coifed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his.\"</p><p>On Friday morning, White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway called the Comey book \"a revisionist view of history\" and accused the former FBI director of taking \"unnecessary immature potshots.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-04/13/201845606020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3H-SNV1-JDH3-G2Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

In addition, record heat has gripped much of the country this week, with numerous monthly temperature records falling, including in Melbourne, where the high reached 105 degrees (40.9 Celsius) on Nov. 21, tying a record that dates back to 1894, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While fire weather warnings have been downgraded slightly for Friday, local time, Thursday featured \"catastrophic\" fire danger - the highest threat level - in the state of Victoria, along with dangerous conditions in South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland.</p><p>Fires burning in New South Wales covered Sydney and other areas of the state's eastern coast in a stifling blanket of hazardous smoke. Tiny particles in the smoke, known as particulate matter 2.5, can enter the lungs and aggravate asthma and other chronic health conditions, as well as raise the risks for other illnesses.</p><p>The extreme heat has been relentless. On Wednesday, for example, temperatures in a portion of every mainland Australian state and the Northern Territory hit at least 104 degrees (40 Celsius). While not unheard of, this is nevertheless unusual, particularly for this time of year.</p><p>What's especially worrisome to public officials and residents throughout the most fire-prone areas is that typically, Australia sees its peak fire activity during the summer, rather than the spring. The heat and \"Code Red\" fire danger in Victoria on Thursday were more akin to the \"worst conditions you'd see in February or March,\" according to Victoria's emergency services minister Lisa Neville.</p><p>\"This shows us what the risks will be in summer around Victoria, so we still have a long way to go to be ready,\" she said, according to The Guardian newspaper.</p><p>The record heat this week has toppled November records in South Australia, too. Nullarbor, for example, hit a blazing 116 degrees (46.6 Celsius). The heat even spread to Tasmania, which typically has more moderate temperatures due to cooler winds from the surrounding ocean. Hobart, for example, tied its record for the hottest November day on Thursday, The BOM reported.</p><p>A large area of South Australia was more than 29 degrees (16 Celsius) above average for this time of year, the BOM found. In other words, the heat experienced this week was more typical of February in the Land Down Under, which, given drought conditions in many areas, is concerning for the long fire season ahead.</p><p>The size of the fires that are still burning are difficult to fathom. Two fires west of Port Macquarie in New South Wales have each burned more than 250,000 acres. In total, the state of New South Wales has seen at least 2,471,053 acres go up in smoke, the majority of it burning in sparsely populated areas.</p><p>More than 600 homes have been destroyed by bush fires so far this season in New South Wales, according to the Rural Fire Service, and six have been killed so far.</p><p>Research shows that human-caused climate change is playing a role in amplifying the fire risk and ratcheting up the heat across large parts of Australia. Wildfires are worsening with climate change because heat and drought make the landscape more flammable. Months of rainfall deficits have left the Australia parched; January through October 2019 was the second-warmest and second-driest such period on record.</p><p>Because of the combination of drought and heat, fires are burning in ecosystems that typically don't see bush fires, according to an interview Science Magazine published with David Bowman, a fire ecologist and director of the Fire Center at the University of Tasmania in Hobart</p><p>\"We're seeing recurrent fires in tall, wet eucalypt forests, which normally only burn very rarely. A swamp dried out near Port Macquarie, and organic sediments in the ground caught on fire,\" Bowman said. \"When you drop the water table, the soil is so rich in organic matter it will burn. We've seen swamps burning all around.\"</p><p>\"This is teaching us what can be true under a climate changed world. The numbers, scale, and diversity of the fires is going to reframe our understanding of bushfire in Australia. This is a major event which will have huge intellectual and policy legacies.\"</p><p>According to a comprehensive 2015 federal climate report, the ongoing bush fires are burning in areas of Australia that are likely to see an uptick in the average forest fire danger index and the number of days with severe fire danger. The study pinned these trends on human-caused climate change, in large part because a warming climate dries out vegetation faster, worsening drought impacts.</p><p>Long-term climate trends in Australia show sharp warming and an increase in extreme heat events. Last summer was the country's hottest on record, and the BOM found climate change exacerbated extreme heat events as well as droughts during the year. Overall, Australia's average annual temperature has increased by 1.8 degrees since 1910, the BOM found, and a 2018 report by the agency said: \"There has been a long-term increase in extreme fire weather, and in the length of the fire season, across large parts of Australia.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019112156407586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJP-RRF1-F103-3463-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

But now that 2020 is at hand, here are my picks for the top local news stories of the past decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A case could be made that housing, or a lack thereof, was No. 1. The city's vacancy rate was 1.8 per cent in 2010. It slipped to zero in 2013 and has remained there since, despite several major housing projects. To wit:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Built: Anderson Gardens, a 33-unit complex for those over 55 or with disabilities, which opened in 2013; and Nelson Commons, a 54-unit condo development above the new Kootenay Co-op, completed in 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Underway: Lakeside Place, a 47-unit building on Nelson Avenue for seniors and adults with disabilities, being developed by Nelson CARES; and a 43-unit building at the corner of Front and Hall streets geared toward low-to-moderate income families, also to be operated by Nelson CARES.</p><p>Yet to come: The 39-unit SHARE Housing Society project on Falls Street, which has been quietly in the works for the last few years, with an announcement expected in January; and a 127-unit seniors housing complex planned for Vernon Street. However, there has been no update on the latter project in months.</p><p>Not built: Nelson Landing, on the former Kootenay Forest Products site; and Kutenai Landing, coming soon since 2005. (The latter site next to the Chahko-Mika Mall was recently rezoned to make it more attractive to developers.)</p><p>City council has also taken steps to encourage more laneway housing, discounted utility rates for secondary suites, and regulated the short-term rental market.</p><p>&amp;#8226; The local housing situation was not helped by the fire at Kerr's Apartments on Jan. 6, 2011. About 80 mostly low-income people were left homeless.</p><p>Sadly, the century-old building was demolished. The site has been vacant ever since, although it has been sold and a sign on the site advertises a proposed 44-unit condo development.</p><p>&amp;#8226; Climate change is the great problem of our times and not just a Nelson issue. But it was top of mind locally when students staged regular rallies outside of city hall and when we breathed air choked with forest fire smoke.</p><p>Evacuation alerts and orders became commonplace due to wildfires that came uncomfortably close to communities (see the Sitkum-Duhamel Creek fire of 2015 and Harrop Creek fire of 2017, among others).</p><p>The Shambhala Music Festival was placed on evacuation alert in 2017 and in 2020 the event will be moved to July in a bid to avoid the worst of the fire season.</p><p>Although fuel mitigation work is carried out regularly, one wildfire expert warns that Nelson has the highest wildfire risk among B.C. communities with more than 10,000 people.</p><p>Fire wasn't the only thing we had to contend with: flood watches were issued several times, with the worst of it coming in 2012 - when Kootenay Lake hit its highest level since 1974, drowning Lakeside Park and North Shore basements - and 2013, when two homes were damaged near Argenta.</p><p>&amp;#8226; The Johnsons Landing slide of July 12, 2012 claimed four lives and destroyed five homes and a water system. It cast a pall over the idyllic community, whose property values were slashed up to 50 per cent, even for those not directly affected.</p><p>A geotechnical analysis blamed record rainfall and late snowmelt for saturating soils on the slope above the community, triggering the slide. A large unstable area remains near the slide's source that could come down one day, but there's no telling when.</p><p>&amp;#8226; On the political front, the MLA for Nelson-Creston on Jan. 1, 2010 was Michelle Mungall. The MLA on Jan. 1, 2020 will still be Michelle Mungall, now B.C.'s energy minister.</p><p>The mayor of Nelson on Jan. 1, 2010 was John Dooley. The mayor on Jan. 1, 2020 will still be John Dooley - although it was not an unbroken streak. Deb Kozak defeated Dooley to become Nelson's first female mayor in 2014, but Dooley won the rematch in 2018.</p><p>&amp;#8226; One of the decade's longest-running sagas began on July 26, 2013 when a tanker truck made a wrong turn onto an unmaintained logging road in the Slocan Valley while delivering fuel for helicopters fighting a forest fire.</p><p>The Lemon Creek spill killed fish, forced evacuations, and sparked a wave of litigation that has not yet been resolved. After the provincial government inexplicably passed on laying charges, resident Marilyn Burgoon launched a private prosecution against the company and the province.</p><p>Federal prosecutors then took over, staying the original charges, but laying new ones, including counts against the driver, who was convicted but is appealing both the verdict and his sentence. The province was acquitted, and the company won a stay of proceedings. The Crown appealed the latter decision and won, but the company has launched a further appeal to be heard in February. (See story page 29.)</p><p>Meanwhile, a class action lawsuit on behalf of all residents affected by the spill continues to wend its way through the courts. Recently the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear an appeal of a decision limiting the issues that could proceed on a class-wide basis and referred the matter back to the B.C. Supreme Court.</p><p>&amp;#8226; Another unfortunate Slocan Valley saga: the fatal shooting of Peter de Groot in 2014, following a manhunt of several days. Local residents criticized RCMP for the scale of the response, which they found grossly out of proportion to the events that caused it.</p><p>Police held a public debriefing but offered few answers, pointing to an investigation by B.C.'s Independent Investigation Office. When the IIO finally released its report 3&amp;#0189; years later, it cleared police of any wrongdoing (no thanks to Corp. Brian Burke, who actually shot de Groot, refused to co-operate with investigators and is now suing the IIO).</p><p>The report didn't address many aspects of the incident, however, much to the dismay of de Groot's family. They're hoping a coroner's inquest scheduled for Rossland next spring will give them more answers. Until then, they're holding a lawsuit against the RCMP in abeyance.</p><p>&amp;#8226; For a while during the green gold rush, we had trouble keeping up with the number of cannabis dispensaries in Nelson. Was it five? Six? Seven? New ones seemed to pop up all the time, as the city granted licenses to what were technically illegal businesses - although police did shut down one and others folded.</p><p>Once cannabis was legalized, city council limited recreational dispensaries to five. But only four applied, and only two have since received the green light from the province to open. By contrast, Trail will soon have seven outlets (including a government cannabis store).</p><p>&amp;#8226; The Nelson aquatic centre and its users took it on the chin this decade.</p><p>In 2013, a section of roof tiles dropped from the false ceiling into the pool. It soon became apparent the fix would not be easy, quick, or cheap. The pool was closed for more than six months, a serious drag for swim clubs who regularly used the facility.</p><p>It closed again in 2015 for a nearly $5 million renovation that was delayed several times, much to the chagrin of users. It finally reopened 13 months later. The good news was that local taxpayers weren't on the hook for a loan, thanks to a major federal grant.</p><p>&amp;#8226; The last decade saw the rebirth of the Civic Theatre.</p><p>In 2010, the city declined to renew its lease with the theatre's longtime private operator and sought other proposals. They got one, but the project stalled after the seats were ripped out and it looked like Nelson would be without a moviehouse.</p><p>The Gravity Climbing Centre and local squash club teamed up on a proposal to turn the space into a multi-purpose sports facility. But movie buffs weren't quite ready to relinquish the space.</p><p>Cindy Sherry spearheaded a last-ditch effort to save the theatre, which quickly gained traction. A society was formed and the city agreed to lease them the space. The society installed new seats, bought a digital projector and new sound system, and began operating five days a week.</p><p>Their long-term plan is still to be realized: adding two more screens to allow greater flexibility in screenings and ensuring the society's financial stability.</p><p>&amp;#8226; The Sinixt First Nation's efforts to be recognized in Canada took a major step forward with a test case brought by Washington state resident Rick Desautel.</p><p>Charged with hunting without a license in B.C., he argued that he and other Sinixt descendents have a right to hunt in their traditional territory, despite being declared extinct in Canada in 1956.</p><p>Desautel was acquitted by a provincial court judge in 2017, a decision upheld by the B.C. Supreme Court and B.C. Court of Appeal. The case is bound for the Supreme Court of Canada in 2020.</p><p>&amp;#8226; One of the biggest crime stories of the decade was a robbery spree in 2013-14. Three credit union branches, a currency exchange, pharmacy, and gas station in Nelson, Castlegar, Salmo, and Robson were all held up at gunpoint.</p><p>It ended dramatically on April 25, 2014 following the robbery of the Nelson and District Credit Union. Police chased two suspects to the Bonnington area and arrested Andrew Stevenson after he jumped off a bridge.</p><p>Stevenson got 10 years for his crimes - and an additional few months for running away from a sheriff while being led into the Nelson courthouse. Co-accused Krista Kalmikoff was sentenced to 4&amp;#0189; years.</p><p>&amp;#8226; A story that made waves initially but seems to have been under-reported lately is the decline of kokanee stocks in Kootenay Lake. Historically, the number of spawning kokanee has ranged anywhere from 250,000 to 2.2 million. About 60,000 were counted in 2019 - higher than in recent years, but still disturbingly low.</p><p>The decline has been blamed on an abundance of kokanee predators (Gerrard rainbow and bull trout). In response, the government placed a moratorium on kokanee fishing on the main lake, changed regulations on bull trout fishing, planted more eggs in spawning channels, released more fry, and continues to add nurients to support kokanee food.</p><p>&amp;#8226; The renegotiation of the Columbia River Treaty was an important story in the 2010s, yet we know very little about what has actually taken place behind closed doors between Canada and the U.S.</p><p>The veil was pierced slightly at recent public meetings, where audiences learned the talks have not yet hit the hard parts, but sticking points are expected to be ecosystem protection and the amount the U.S. pays Canada for power generated by Columbia River flows.</p><p>&amp;#8226; The 2010s saw the return of dogs to Baker Street following their banishment in 1995. After a National Post story shamed the city for prohibiting pooches downtown, then-city councillor Deb Kozak tried to have the ban lifted for a trial period, but found no support from her colleagues.</p><p>However, at an all-candidates forum in 2014, virtually every candidate indicated they would support relaxing the bylaw. Within two months of being sworn in, the new council overturned the ban.</p><p>&amp;#8226; When the decade began, Nelson had a daily newspaper, two weeklies, an online source, and three radio stations. It finishes the decade with one weekly newspaper, one online source, and three radio stations.</p><p>All part of a changing media landscape with ad revenue for traditional products declining thanks in no small part to certain internet giants. (Looking at you, Google and Facebook.)</p><p>The Nelson Daily News folded in 2010 after a run of 108 years. The Express followed in 2011 after 23 years. The Nelson Post existed online from 2010-12.</p><p>That left the Nelson Star as the only print publication in town (the Star went twice weekly in 2010, but reverted to weekly last year) and The Nelson Daily as its online competitor.</p><p>Greg Nesteroff is the acting editor of the Nelson Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3925958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVN-Y7R1-JDH1-C52F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1948\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 28, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

In addition, record heat has gripped much of the country this week, with numerous monthly temperature records falling, including in Melbourne, where the high reached 105 degrees (40.9 Celsius) on Nov. 21, tying a record that dates back to 1894, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While fire weather warnings have been downgraded slightly for Friday, local time, Thursday featured \"catastrophic\" fire danger - the highest threat level - in the state of Victoria, along with dangerous conditions in South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland.</p><p>Fires burning in New South Wales covered Sydney and other areas of the state's eastern coast in a stifling blanket of hazardous smoke. Tiny particles in the smoke, known as particulate matter 2.5, can enter the lungs and aggravate asthma and other chronic health conditions, as well as raise the risks for other illnesses.</p><p>The extreme heat has been relentless. On Wednesday, for example, temperatures in a portion of every mainland Australian state and the Northern Territory hit at least 104 degrees (40 Celsius). While not unheard of, this is nevertheless unusual, particularly for this time of year.</p><p>What's especially worrisome to public officials and residents throughout the most fire-prone areas is that typically, Australia sees its peak fire activity during the summer, rather than the spring. The heat and \"Code Red\" fire danger in Victoria on Thursday were more akin to the \"worst conditions you'd see in February or March,\" according to Victoria's emergency services minister Lisa Neville.</p><p>\"This shows us what the risks will be in summer around Victoria, so we still have a long way to go to be ready,\" she said, according to The Guardian newspaper.</p><p>The record heat this week has toppled November records in South Australia, too. Nullarbor, for example, hit a blazing 116 degrees (46.6 Celsius). The heat even spread to Tasmania, which typically has more moderate temperatures due to cooler winds from the surrounding ocean. Hobart, for example, tied its record for the hottest November day on Thursday, The BOM reported.</p><p>A large area of South Australia was more than 29 degrees (16 Celsius) above average for this time of year, the BOM found. In other words, the heat experienced this week was more typical of February in the Land Down Under, which, given drought conditions in many areas, is concerning for the long fire season ahead.</p><p>The size of the fires that are still burning are difficult to fathom. Two fires west of Port Macquarie in New South Wales have each burned more than 250,000 acres. In total, the state of New South Wales has seen at least 2,471,053 acres go up in smoke, the majority of it burning in sparsely populated areas.</p><p>More than 600 homes have been destroyed by bush fires so far this season in New South Wales, according to the Rural Fire Service, and six have been killed so far.</p><p>Research shows that human-caused climate change is playing a role in amplifying the fire risk and ratcheting up the heat across large parts of Australia. Wildfires are worsening with climate change because heat and drought make the landscape more flammable. Months of rainfall deficits have left the Australia parched; January through October 2019 was the second-warmest and second-driest such period on record.</p><p>Because of the combination of drought and heat, fires are burning in ecosystems that typically don't see bush fires, according to an interview Science Magazine published with David Bowman, a fire ecologist and director of the Fire Center at the University of Tasmania in Hobart</p><p>\"We're seeing recurrent fires in tall, wet eucalypt forests, which normally only burn very rarely. A swamp dried out near Port Macquarie, and organic sediments in the ground caught on fire,\" Bowman said. \"When you drop the water table, the soil is so rich in organic matter it will burn. We've seen swamps burning all around.\"</p><p>\"This is teaching us what can be true under a climate changed world. The numbers, scale, and diversity of the fires is going to reframe our understanding of bushfire in Australia. This is a major event which will have huge intellectual and policy legacies.\"</p><p>According to a comprehensive 2015 federal climate report, the ongoing bush fires are burning in areas of Australia that are likely to see an uptick in the average forest fire danger index and the number of days with severe fire danger. The study pinned these trends on human-caused climate change, in large part because a warming climate dries out vegetation faster, worsening drought impacts.</p><p>Long-term climate trends in Australia show sharp warming and an increase in extreme heat events. Last summer was the country's hottest on record, and the BOM found climate change exacerbated extreme heat events as well as droughts during the year. Overall, Australia's average annual temperature has increased by 1.8 degrees since 1910, the BOM found, and a 2018 report by the agency said: \"There has been a long-term increase in extreme fire weather, and in the length of the fire season, across large parts of Australia.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019112156407820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJP-RRF1-F103-3469-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(\"Apex\") (TSXV: APX) reports that Margaux Resources Ltd. (\"Margaux\") has transferred the Ore Hill Gold property to Apex. The Ore Hill property is located within an area clause that surrounded the Jersey-Emerald lead-zinc-tungsten property and was therefore transferred to Apex in compliance with the terms of the Jersey Property Agreement which was terminated on October 1, 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The property was one of the highlights for Margaux's work in 2018. At Ore Hill, a gold soil anomaly, 1,500 m long by up to 150 m wide is known from previous exploration work. In 2017 rock samples collected within a 950 m x 150 m area by Margaux, returned high-grade gold values including 119 g/t (or 3.8 oz/ton) and 105 g/t Au (or 3.4 oz/ton). A drill program planned for 2018 could not be completed due to forest fire conditions.</p><p>The Ore Hill property is located 5 km east of the Jersey Mine in the southern portion of the Sheep Creek Gold District and covers the historically known Ore Hill, Summit and Bonanza occurrences. There are two known styles of mineralization on the Ore Hill property; narrow high-grade gold (plus silver, lead and zinc) bearing veins occur within limestone; and a gold-bearing crackle zone, up to 10 m wide, associated with a north-northeast-trending fault zone and geological contact. There is limited historical production from the Ore Hill property, as follows: Summit: 1,205 tons averaging 0.72 oz/t Au, 1.01 oz/t Ag, 1.25% Pb, 1.18% Zn and Ore Hill: 2,470 tons averaging 1.15 oz/t Au, 2.19 oz/t Ag, 3.58% Pb, 3.37% Zn (BC Minfile 82FSW054 &amp; 082FSW053) .In order to complete the acquisition of the Ore Hill property Apex must complete remaining outstanding option payments to the original property vendors comprised of $55,000 and 100,000 shares over three years. The property is subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty (\"NSR\"). Apex may at any time purchase the NSR for $250,000.</p><p>For further information on Apex's projects, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.apxresources.com\">www.apxresources.com</url>.</p><p>Arthur G.

Ottawa's share would be about $880 million.</p><p>The plan calls for replacing aging equipment such as water bombers, stepping up the recruitment and training of firefighters, developing better guidelines for building homes and subdivisions in forested areas and removing dead trees and brush near communities.</p><p>While some progress is being made, the two levels of government have not approved the major funding needed to fully implement the strategy.</p><p>''We are looking for some signal that it is actually a national priority, that there is interest among the provinces and territories to get into this question more pointedly. We are just not there yet,'' said Gordon Miller, director general of the Canadian Forest Service's Northern Forestry Centre.</p><p>Canada hasn't experienced a major devastating forest fire since 2003, when flames torched homes in the Kelowna area and other parts of British Columbia's interior, forcing the evacuation of about 50,000 people.</p><p>Researchers say in the future Canada will face a higher risk of similar wildfires because of factors such as climate change, the trend toward building more homes in forested areas and the fact that large tracts of timber are being rendered dry and dead by the mountain pine beetle.</p><p>Canada's Wildland Fire Strategy is a great plan, but without the proper funding it may not be able to deal with the major fires it was designed to mitigate or prevent, says Dave Martel, a forest fire management researcher at the University of Toronto.</p><p>''I'm very concerned that this thing is not happening as soon as the people who developed it had hoped,'' Martel said. ''What happened in Kelowna could happen again.''</p><p>''There are places in other parts of Canada that are vulnerable. We've had signals from Kelowna and we have seen what can happen in places like southern California. We have got to get moving on this.''</p><p>Natural Resources Canada officials could not be reached for comment.</p><p>But some provincial governments have rolled out their own fire prevention projects, in some case with federal funding help.</p><p>Following the Kelowna experience, the B.C. government came up with a program to encourage municipalities to develop their own wildfire protection plans.</p><p>Focused mainly on communities in the interior from Prince George south to the Okanagan Valley, the program includes removing dead trees and brush from near homes. The province is also working with local governments and developers to better plan subdivisions in forested areas.</p><p>''We have some very active local communities stepping up to the plate on this,'' said Murray Henry, a forest fire fuels specialist with the B.C. government. Henry was on the front lines during the 2003 Kelowna fires.</p><p>''We are due for another fire season like what we had in 2003. All those conditions will line up to happen again. It is just how much we can prepare between now and then to protect our structures and our homes.''</p><p>Alberta is also facing an increased fire threat due to tinder-dry conditions and the impact of the mountain pine beetle. Last summer the province temporarily closed forests in southwest Alberta as a precaution.</p><p>The Alberta government has also been promoting a program called FireSmart that provides homeowners, communities and other forest users with information on how to protect their property from wildfires.</p><p>Dennis Brown, director of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, says efforts by the provinces to protect their communities with mitigation plans are great. But he says they don't deal with the need to replace or refit Canada's aging fleet of water bombers or other measures called for in the Canadian fire strategy.</p><p>What is needed is action from Ottawa, he said.</p><p>''Everyone is still trying to move forward to get the federal government to consider the funding within the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy,'' says Brown. ''Is this going to sneak up on us? Probably.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20071103CPCPG1962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4R2N-RWN0-TX4V-K0FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>November 3, 2007 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(\"Apex\") (TSXV: APX) reports that Margaux Resources Ltd. (\"Margaux\") has transferred the Ore Hill Gold property to Apex. The Ore Hill property is located within an area clause that surrounded the Jersey-Emerald lead-zinc-tungsten property and was therefore transferred to Apex in compliance with the terms of the Jersey Property Agreement which was terminated on October 1, 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The property was one of the highlights for Margaux's work in 2018. At Ore Hill, a gold soil anomaly, 1,500 m long by up to 150 m wide is known from previous exploration work. In 2017 rock samples collected within a 950 m x 150 m area by Margaux, returned high-grade gold values including 119 g/t (or 3.8 oz/ton) and 105 g/t Au (or 3.4 oz/ton). A drill program planned for 2018 could not be completed due to forest fire conditions.</p><p>The Ore Hill property is located 5 km east of the Jersey Mine in the southern portion of the Sheep Creek Gold District and covers the historically known Ore Hill, Summit and Bonanza occurrences. There are two known styles of mineralization on the Ore Hill property; narrow high-grade gold (plus silver, lead and zinc) bearing veins occur within limestone; and a gold-bearing crackle zone, up to 10 m wide, associated with a north-northeast-trending fault zone and geological contact. There is limited historical production from the Ore Hill property, as follows: Summit: 1,205 tons averaging 0.72 oz/t Au, 1.01 oz/t Ag, 1.25% Pb, 1.18% Zn and Ore Hill: 2,470 tons averaging 1.15 oz/t Au, 2.19 oz/t Ag, 3.58% Pb, 3.37% Zn (BC Minfile 82FSW054 &amp; 082FSW053) .In order to complete the acquisition of the Ore Hill property Apex must complete remaining outstanding option payments to the original property vendors comprised of $55,000 and 100,000 shares over three years. The property is subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty (\"NSR\"). Apex may at any time purchase the NSR for $250,000.</p><p>For further information on Apex's projects, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.apxresources.com\">www.apxresources.com</url>.</p><p>Arthur G.

Ottawa's share would be about $880 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plan calls for replacing aging equipment such as water bombers, stepping up the recruitment and training of firefighters, developing better guidelines for building homes and subdivisions in forested areas and removing dead trees and brush near communities.</p><p>While some progress is being made, the two levels of government have not approved the major funding needed to fully implement the strategy.</p><p>''We are looking for some signal that it is actually a national priority, that there is interest among the provinces and territories to get into this question more pointedly. We are just not there yet,'' said Gordon Miller, director general of the Canadian Forest Service's Northern Forestry Centre.</p><p>Canada hasn't experienced a major devastating forest fire since 2003, when flames torched homes in the Kelowna area and other parts of British Columbia's interior, forcing the evacuation of about 50,000 people.</p><p>Researchers say in the future Canada will face a higher risk of similar wildfires because of factors such as climate change, the trend toward building more homes in forested areas and the fact that large tracts of timber are being rendered dry and dead by the mountain pine beetle.</p><p>Canada's Wildland Fire Strategy is a great plan, but without the proper funding it may not be able to deal with the major fires it was designed to mitigate or prevent, says Dave Martel, a forest fire management researcher at the University of Toronto.</p><p>''I'm very concerned that this thing is not happening as soon as the people who developed it had hoped,'' Martel said. ''What happened in Kelowna could happen again.''</p><p>''There are places in other parts of Canada that are vulnerable. We've had signals from Kelowna and we have seen what can happen in places like southern California. We have got to get moving on this.''</p><p>Natural Resources Canada officials could not be reached for comment.</p><p>But some provincial governments have rolled out their own fire prevention projects, in some case with federal funding help.</p><p>Following the Kelowna experience, the B.C. government came up with a program to encourage municipalities to develop their own wildfire protection plans.</p><p>Focused mainly on communities in the interior from Prince George south to the Okanagan Valley, the program includes removing dead trees and brush from near homes. The province is also working with local governments and developers to better plan subdivisions in forested areas.</p><p>''We have some very active local communities stepping up to the plate on this,'' said Murray Henry, a forest fire fuels specialist with the B.C. government. Henry was on the front lines during the 2003 Kelowna fires.</p><p>''We are due for another fire season like what we had in 2003. All those conditions will line up to happen again. It is just how much we can prepare between now and then to protect our structures and our homes.''</p><p>Alberta is also facing an increased fire threat due to tinder-dry conditions and the impact of the mountain pine beetle. Last summer the province temporarily closed forests in southwest Alberta as a precaution.</p><p>The Alberta government has also been promoting a program called FireSmart that provides homeowners, communities and other forest users with information on how to protect their property from wildfires.</p><p>Dennis Brown, director of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, says efforts by the provinces to protect their communities with mitigation plans are great. But he says they don't deal with the need to replace or refit Canada's aging fleet of water bombers or other measures called for in the Canadian fire strategy.</p><p>What is needed is action from Ottawa, he said.</p><p>''Everyone is still trying to move forward to get the federal government to consider the funding within the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy,'' says Brown.

These money savers included fixing splash pad deficiencies, which was under budget by $38,000, and the fire master plan, which saved $27,000 more than expected.</p><p>Also presented to council was the 2015 operations year-end report. The town finished off the year with a $414,000 surplus. The surplus will be divided between three areas - $76,000 will go to the town's streetlight deficit, $188,000 will be set aside to deal with tax losses from assessment at risk, and $151,000 will go to the corporate reserve.</p><p>Tax losses could occur when large businesses like box stores or nursing homes appeal taxes they've paid, Sequeira explained at a budget meeting in March. If they win the appeal, the town has to reimburse them. The corporate reserve is a fund for unexpected events.</p><p>\"We will put aside some money so we can deal with an unforeseeable winter storm or forest fire,\" Sequira said.</p><p>Also at council, staff presented the first quarter operations report. So far the town has used 13.5 per cent of its $13.4-million net operating budget.

The company hoped to have a better idea of when the mill could reopen by Monday.</p><p>\"We were in the middle of its path,\" he said of the fire. \"It shows the great response of our employees, some of whom lost their own homes.\"</p><p>As the fire roared through trees, brush and homes on Schoolhouse Hill on Monday, the mill had enough warning to send home most of the 60 workers on the day shift, and mobilize the mill fire crew, Wise said.</p><p>While they fought to save the mill, firebrands blew overhead and ignited bocks of houses downwind.</p><p>With 170 workers, the mill is the second largest employer in Weed, a blue-collar town of 3,000 people in the shadow of Mount Shasta, and it dates to 1897, when founder Abner Weed decided to take advantage of its strong winds as a natural drying process for the lumber turned out by his sawmills.</p><p>The mill shutdown, however temporary, is one more blow to Weed, which has never recovered from the logging cutbacks of the 1990s to protect the threatened northern spotted owl and salmon that put tens of thousands of people in Siskiyou County out of work, said Siskiyou County Supervisor Michael Kobseff.</p><p>The mill jobs are particularly valuable because they pay wages high enough to support a family, much higher than the tourism jobs that many have to turn to, he said. Some who lost their homes are determined to rebuild, but others have no insurance, making state and federal assistance important, he said.</p><p>\"It's just going to be this close-knit community trying to get back on track,\" he said. \"It's not going to be overnight.\"</p><p>Winds gusting up to 40 mph pushed the flames into town, where they quickly chewed through a hillside neighbourhood. Officials said a significant number of the 150 structures burned were houses; three firefighters lost their homes. The cause is under investigation.</p><p>\"It went through here so fast it was unbelievable,\" Jim Taylor, a retired butcher who has lived in the town for 30 years, said Tuesday. His house was one of three standing along his street after firefighters arrived in time to foam the side next to his neighbour's burning house. \"I'm not a real religious person, but somebody was looking out for me.\"</p><p>The remnants of the Holy Family Catholic Church were still smouldering, its metal girders twisted on the ground.</p><p>\"I mean it was devastating,\" said Maureen Campbell, the church's music minister who was baptized, confirmed and married at the church, along with her children. She lost her home to the fire.</p><p>\"The house up there is no big deal. It can be rebuilt,\" she said. \"But this is my family church, you know? It's much more endearing to me.\"</p><p>Fire crews took advantage of calmer winds and firefighting aircraft Tuesday, gaining control in and around Weed. Flames still threatened in other parts of California.</p><p>In Oakhurst, a foothill community south of Yosemite National Park, a 320-acre fire that damaged or destroyed 71 structures - 37 of them homes - was 50 per cent contained. About 600 residents from 200 homes remained evacuated, Madera County sheriff's spokeswoman Erica Stuart said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a wildfire north of the town of Pollock Pines, about 60 miles east of Sacramento, has forced the evacuation of at least 700 homes. The wildfire has blackened about 20 square miles of forest land. It was only 5 per cent contained.</p><p>More than 1,500 firefighters battled the blaze, which started in a remote area Saturday but exploded Sunday when it reached a canyon of thick, dry brush. It was only 5 per cent contained.</p><p>More than 4,000 wildfires have burned in California this year.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Terry Collins in San Francisco, Raquel Dillon in Weed, Alina Hartounian in Phoenix, and Robert Jablon and Daisy Nguyen in Los Angeles contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e255e8cdf1a9429db8d6ae7273ea75b4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D59-JCR1-JBVR-32HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><timeReceived>03:48 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 17, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was declared under control on Aug. 23 and out Oct. 31.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Parry Sound 33 burned, Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry staff were in contact with area municipal officials, including Archipelago, to ensure compliance with the regional and provincial fire ban and for emergency planning.</p><p>Parry Sound MMRF Enforcement Unit manager Rob Gibson outlined the fire and answered council questions at the Archipelago's Oct. 19 meeting. Staff told council they and ministry staff continually were \"moving the yard stick forward\" in communication practices between themselves and residents.</p><p>The goal was to keep the fire from crossing the Pickerel River to the north and the CN Rail tracks to the east where the flames could have tucked into Jack pine and, as Gibson said, \"the whole area would have exploded.\"</p><p>As about 350 firefighters from across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico were working to exhaustion in order to evacuate campers and residents, vacationers were heading in by boat unaware of the situation, private drones were in the no-fly zone, and reporters and the public were on the ground: In one case a reporter was on a kayak attempting to photograph a water bomber, forcing it to abort twice at $1,000 a pop. Those aware of the fire were scared it crossed Highway 69 at one point.</p><p>\"One of the things we learned right off the hop was better communication,\" Gibson said.</p><p>The province made photos and video available to the media, communications staff were available seven-days a week and its forest fire website was updated daily.</p><p>The province made the entire region a restrict fire zone in addition to the municipal fire bans to try and stop any new fires, but people weren't getting the message or chose to ignore it with 64 people fined by the ministry alone.</p><p>\"Officials were basically going night and day,\" Gibson said.</p><p>Ministry staff also learned to use social media where communities \"talked among themselves\" of camp fires.</p><p>The fire ban zone ended at the Parry Sound District and Muskoka boundary. For Archipelago residents and visitors, and those visiting the Mississauga Provincial Park, that meant when they were in MacTier there wasn't a ban.</p><p>\"There was an awful lot of confusion,\" said Coun. Grant Walker.</p><p>Council also expressed concern that the fines levelled weren't as high as the $25,000 maximum, outlining one case where a man lit a camp fire twice.

Dramatic drone video shows the highway that became a death trap when a wall of flames engulfed the fleeing cars. The fire so hot it actually melted the pavement. At least 61 people were killed, including a four-year-old boy. Fifty-four others were injured including four firefighters. The Portuguese government has declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the disaster, which is still unfolding at this hour. CTV's Todd Battis has the details.</p><p>TODD BATTIS (Reporter): Panic and devastation so complete, entire communities were evacuated. Emergency crews were able to get many homeowners to safety. Leaving everything behind, they however are the fortunate ones. Dozens have died. A fire so fierce, so fast moving, it could not be outrun. Instead of fleeing the inferno, some wound up driving right into it, killed in their cars where they stopped. Some of the most seriously injured were airlifted out of the fire zone north of Lisbon. Nine hundred firefighters are in an epic battle to get the wildfire under control. Several have been hurt. This woman called what she saw a storm of fire. \"I told my husband this is the end of the world.\" Portugal is suffering through a heatwave leaving the countryside dry and vulnerable. Lightning strikes likely sparked the fire. Touring the area, Portugal's prime minister declared three days of national mourning for what he called the worst tragedy in half a century. \"The fire remains very active and we have the Navy and Army responding,\" assured Antonio Costa. Portugal's national soccer team observed a moment of silence ahead of an afternoon match in Russia. Pope Francis urged worshippers in St. Peter's Square to pray for the victims. In Toronto, home to a large Portuguese community, ex-pats have been closely watching what's going on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Wow, it's terrible. It's very close to my place.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Well, it's a sad event. It's something that happens, you know, unfortunately every summer. There's a lot of fires in Portugal.</p><p>BATTIS: Indeed, forest fires are common, almost expected in most of southern Europe this time of year. Still, the image of a ghostly highway littered with burned out vehicles with bodies inside will linger long after the fires fizzle out.

From the relatively minor hail storm in the Calgary area in 2012 which caused over $500 Million worth of damage, to the rather more significant floods in Calgary the following year and then the Fort MacMurray forest fire that razed several neighborhoods of the city and was not extinguished for over a year, no corner of the province has been spared in the last decade.</p><p>\"Are we ready?\" is a question that has been asked by Director of Emergency Management, Todd Pawsey, and it is a question he is looking to find an answer too, especially since the region of Paintearth County was rocked by a major snowfall on Oct. 2, 2017, well before the snowfall season in Alberta typically starts. After the snowfall, due to the scope of the weather event, he pulled together elected officials, municipal administrators, and emergency services personnel to review what happened, and what can be done better.</p><p>Eight months later, the group was drawn together again to review the problems and talk about any solutions that have been found. As the group took turns reporting on progress made, the feeling in the room was positive.</p><p>The biggest three issues that were identified all lead back to one big one: Power. When the storm hit last October, some areas of the county were without power for over 60 hours. The loss of power attributed to a communication breakdown as cell phone and radio towers exhausted their back-up power supplies. The loss of power also shut down the ability of emergency vehicles to get the fuel they need to operate, as the fuel station pumps and point of sale equipment are all electrically driven.</p><p>\"It is key to get a fuel supply,\" was the comment made by Lorne Dewart, the Operations Manager of East Central Ambulance Association. \"No fuel, we don't move.\" The manager of the Co-Op gas bar out at the crossroads of highways 36 and 12 is working on getting an emergency generator for their location, due to their remote location. ECAA and the county have both thrown their support behind the manager and have drafted letters to pressure the Co-Op head office to agree to the generator.</p><p>The county yard just west of town is also being wired for a generator in order to keep them operating in the case of a prolonged power outage, as is the Paintearth Lodge in Castor. Several other public buildings across the region are also being wired with the switching gear need to connect a portable generator for any prolonged outages.</p><p>As for communications, the Alberta transport office in Hanna which was completely cut off from their resources in the October 2 blizzard due to communications failure, has purchased a satellite phone to communicate with their head office in Edmonton, and communications upgrades are being made across the region and at the East Central 911 callcenter in Wainright.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASTOR-3611707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASTOR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM7-TX51-JDH3-G2BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459600</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Castor Advance</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 20, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

A return to more seasonal weather conditions and recent precipitation has reduced the wildfire risk in these areas.</p><p>The BC Wildfire Service reminds the public that Category 2 and Category 3 open fires, which are fires larger than 0.5 metres by 0.5 metres, remain prohibited in these three fire centres. A poster explaining the different categories of open burning is available online at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://ow.ly/znny309kJv5\">http://ow.ly/znny309kJv5</url></p><p>The use of sky lanterns, binary exploding targets, air curtain burners, fireworks (including firecrackers) and burning barrels or burning cages of any size or description remain prohibited throughout the Southeast Fire Centre, but will be allowed in the Kamloops Fire Centre and Cariboo Fire Centre as of noon on Sept. 22. The use of tiki torches and chimineas will be allowed in all three fire centres as of noon on Sept. 22.</p><p>People wishing to light a campfire must have ready access to eight litres of water or a shovel during the entire time the campfire is lit. They also must completely extinguish the campfire and the ashes must be cold to the touch before they leave the area for any length of time.</p><p>Open burning prohibitions apply to all BC Parks, Crown lands and private lands, but do not apply within the boundaries of a local government that has forest fire prevention bylaws and is serviced by a fire department. Always check with local authorities to see if any other burning restrictions are in place before lighting any fire.</p><p>Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.</p><p>Although the off-road vehicle prohibition in the Cariboo Fire Centre, Kamloops Fire Centre and Southeast Fire Centre was rescinded on Sept. 20, 2017, the public is reminded that area restrictions are in effect in the vicinity of some wildfires in these fire centres.</p><p>More information about current area restrictions and open burning prohibitions can be found online at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gov.bc.ca/wildfirebans\">http://www.gov.bc.ca/wildfirebans</url></p><p>To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call *5555 on a cellphone or 1 800 663-5555 toll-free.</p><p>For the latest information on current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, road closures and air quality advisories, visit: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bcwildfire.ca\">www.bcwildfire.ca</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FREPRS-3439981</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FREPRS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJF-N4J1-F105-62PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"451\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Free Press (Fernie)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

It was declared under control on Aug. 23 and out Oct. 31.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Parry Sound 33 burned, Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry staff were in contact with area municipal officials, including Archipelago, to ensure compliance with the regional and provincial fire ban and for emergency planning.</p><p>Parry Sound MMRF Enforcement Unit manager Rob Gibson outlined the fire and answered council questions at the Archipelago's Oct. 19 meeting. Staff told council they and ministry staff continually were \"moving the yard stick forward\" in communication practices between themselves and residents.</p><p>The goal was to keep the fire from crossing the Pickerel River to the north and the CN Rail tracks to the east where the flames could have tucked into Jack pine and, as Gibson said, \"the whole area would have exploded.\"</p><p>As about 350 firefighters from across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico were working to exhaustion in order to evacuate campers and residents, vacationers were heading in by boat unaware of the situation, private drones were in the no-fly zone, and reporters and the public were on the ground: In one case a reporter was on a kayak attempting to photograph a water bomber, forcing it to abort twice at $1,000 a pop. Those aware of the fire were scared it crossed Highway 69 at one point.</p><p>\"One of the things we learned right off the hop was better communication,\" Gibson said.</p><p>The province made photos and video available to the media, communications staff were available seven-days a week and its forest fire website was updated daily.</p><p>The province made the entire region a restrict fire zone in addition to the municipal fire bans to try and stop any new fires, but people weren't getting the message or chose to ignore it with 64 people fined by the ministry alone.</p><p>\"Officials were basically going night and day,\" Gibson said.</p><p>Ministry staff also learned to use social media where communities \"talked among themselves\" of camp fires.</p><p>The fire ban zone ended at the Parry Sound District and Muskoka boundary. For Archipelago residents and visitors, and those visiting the Mississauga Provincial Park, that meant when they were in MacTier there wasn't a ban.</p><p>\"There was an awful lot of confusion,\" said Coun. Grant Walker.</p><p>Council also expressed concern that the fines levelled weren't as high as the $25,000 maximum, outlining one case where a man lit a camp fire twice. Gibson shared that conservation officers can use discretion in laying fines. The ministry wasn't aware of the first case dealt with by a township bylaw official, which spurred more discussion between the township and ministry.</p><p>\"It was an embarrassment to the township,\" said Reeve Peter Ketchum.</p><p>Parry Sound 33 was one of 1,325 forest fires this year and one of 12 where the cause hasn't been released yet.</p><p>The largest fire was Nipigon 30 that burned 32,850.5 hectares.</p><p>While not the largest fire in the province this summer it is by far the largest in the district since 1999, when 75 hectares were burnt, and was a priority given the population.</p><p>Factbox:</p><p>Story behind the story</p><p>I have been writing about Parry Sound 33 since it was first reported to the MNRF. I was at the Archipelago meeting and before I could write the story the fire was declared out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018110248442714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNR-1MB1-F103-3514-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Both the Crown and the defence had asked for leniency.</p><p>Halford, who is 35, entered guilty pleas last year on seven counts of fraud. She had claimed that she had aggressive breast cancer and that she and her family had lost everything in the 2016 Fort McMurray forest fire in northern Alberta.</p><p>She received donations that included gift cards, food, clothing, babysitting services and beauty treatments.</p><p>The Crown said Halford was going through depression when she made the claims.</p><p>\"Some of the things that happened to you after your crimes were highly publicized were absolutely shocking,\" Brown said as Halford sobbed in the prisoner's box.</p><p>\"They are the most horrible manifestations of mob mentality. A mob doesn't have a brain and nor does it have a compassionate heart,\" the judge said.</p><p>\"What happens when a mob acts is the behaviour is driven by fear and anger. You've been subjected to some of that and it's a shocking and horrible thing.\"</p><p>Halford, who declined an opportunity to address the court, blurted out at that point: \"It's scary.\"</p><p>Prosecutor Jason Wuttunee told court that Halford's motivation was not greed, but a way to gain the attention and support she felt she needed.</p><p>He said Halford was sexually abused as a child, had to care for a disabled brother, took in several foster children over the years and lost her five-year-old daughter to cancer in 2011.</p><p>\"There is much to be said about ... the woman who has experienced a significant amount of tragedy in her life, a woman who was overwhelmed and unable to cope with circumstances,\" said Wuttunee.</p><p>Outside court, the prosecutor applauded the judge for accepting the joint submission that suggested Halford had already suffered.</p><p>\"Miss Halford had reported that she had suffered from death threats and other stigmas as a result of committing the crimes,\" he said.</p><p>\"Miss Halford was publicly shamed and disgraced as a result of doing what she has done and ... what the judge is trying to say is mob mentality is not justified.\"</p><p>Halford was ordered to pay restitution to her victims, to perform 100 hours of community service, to stay away from social media and to seek counselling.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2017091943628876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHK-SF31-JDH3-G4PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Unfortunately, that's largely missing the point: it's what occurred in the moments before the spill that should resonate most with Slocan Valley residents; specifically, the fuel truck driver's inability to communicate by cell phone.</p><p>This may have prevented the episode entirely - the driver being apprised that he may have been on the wrong road to the helicopter awaiting refuelling to fight a forest fire.</p><p>But it's often convenient to ignore the obvious, and in this case the lack of cell phone coverage along a populated, commercial highway corridor may have resulted in 33,000 litres of jet fuel entering Lemon Creek.</p><p>The defendants in the lawsuit are the Executive Flight Centre, which employed the driver, the driver himself, and the provincial government. That's all fine and dandy, but make no mistake: in the court of public opinion, Telus is on trial, too.</p><p>In 2011, Telus signed an agreement with the province to connect more than 1,700 kilometres of unconnected highways with wireless service by the end of 2016. Highway 6, which crosses Lemon Creek between Crescent Valley and Slocan City, is included in that contract.</p><p>The Connecting British Columbia Agreement (CBCA) clearly outlines that Telus and the province have failed to live up to their commitments.</p><p>This despite numerous entreaties from civic authorities and emergency services to get the cell service up and running, including a petition forwarded by Slocan City council asking Telus and the Ministry of Transportation to provide the village with cell phone service.</p><p>The RCMP has publicly acknowledged that their communications activities during the search for a Slocan shooting suspect were hampered by the lack of cell coverage.</p><p>It's a fact that more than half of all 911 calls are currently made from cell phones - a vital tool in emergency response and public safety.</p><p>  The province - equally culpable and co-signatory to the Connecting British Columbia Agreement - is a defendant in the Lemon Creek case and will formally take the stand.</p><p>The government's silence on Slocan public safety and security is about to end: Crown prosecutors and a judge will see to that.</p><p>Chris Dawson</p><p>Winlaw</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3300423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N34-P0K1-JDH3-G112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 28, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00028PZ</classCode><className>TELUS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TU (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>T (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Cellular Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBFODkzRTVGMjcxNEJEMkE5OEJERjZBMDUyQ0JBOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODgzMzVFMEM4REFFNDc0MTg3NUU4OUEwQzE4MDBGRUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001243</classCode><className>OIL SPILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D97F</classCode><className>FUEL SPILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp;

It's not too late... Ready set, STRETCH, then get to it. Stretching is getting more important to me prior to garden activities. It is possible to incapacitate myself in a single gardening session now. Things were 'different' then. Life gets better, as I age, provided care is taken of some physical and mental requirements. Lots of walks help me. Being in the Okanagan is not too shabby either.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am writing part of this in Osoyoos tending my Momma's garden and home that she enjoyed so much. The desert is a complete flip from coastal rainforest, and the difference is quite charming. As we tidy up and head for home the roses have just begun to bloom, and lovely they are. Their beauty is twofold because they are 'old' roses that have an exceptional scent, and have been growing for many years (we moved them from the orchard home when my mom moved). Osoyoos is prime climate for roses, they love the heat if adequate water is available. I do grow roses in Port too, but it's a hard slog compared to here.</p><p>Whilst diligently perusing the buds and new growth for aphids each morning I came upon a ladybug doing the same thing and realized that God perfect plan working, I do not have to worry about it, but I like to fuss. Two different colours of aphids (green and brown) have shown up so far. The green ones are on three bushes, but the larger brown ones seem to prefer the largest rose bush. There are no roses with both types. Interesting huh? Who knows what that means, if anything?</p><p>READ MORE: Deer Gardener: Keeping the bloom on the rose</p><p>A drive along the back roads, where I learned to drive 54 years ago caused us to find wild asparagus, one each for the four of us, to munch on. Outstanding flavour that took me back to being a 'kid'. Love it! It was our candy in May.</p><p>The forest fire you may have seen on the news in Keremeos area was very scary, and here comes another wildfire season. Fortunately, it was contained within a couple of days, but the land is tinder dry out here. A vehicle fire caused the whole thing.</p><p>There is no place like home....</p><p>As I arrived home to Port Clements, the dryness continued to be on my mind, it is very dry here also. These Islands on fire are our worst nightmare... please be super conservative with anything that could even remotely start a fire... especially cigarette butts and campfires. We did well last year to get through reasonably unscathed let's do it again please.</p><p>One of the first things I noticed as I wandered around my yard upon settling into home, is that the deer ate my Bergenia... aren't they cute! Grrr. I had netted over some things, but not those. We wait all year for a one shot bloom and Bambi eats it! Sheesh.</p><p>As we head into this dry season, let's consider more mulching to provide retention of moisture in the garden beds. Grass clippings are readily available and provide excellent mulch. You must not place the green clippings right up to the new plants that pop through the ground, the mulch is 'manure' and will burn young plants. A liberal dose of nitrogen comes from the grass, and a good dose of heat as they compost, so be watchful for problems. Some plants do not want extra nitrogen. When you place them in the zones between the seedlings, they give the bugs something to eat other than your new seedlings.</p><p>Try to place an inch or two of clippings at a time then wait until they dry before adding more, next mowing.</p><p>Keep the soil by the seedlings stirred up, so any watering you do will go directly to the plants and not run off. Creating a well around the base of larger plants can also help conserve water.</p><p>Seaweed is my all-time favorite mulch for next to the seedlings. It doesn't burn and as it breaks down some serious nutrition is added to the soil. If your clippings are especially weedy, place a couple layers of newspaper down first to keep the weed problem down.</p><p>So, for this session that's it! Have a great June!</p><p>READ MORE: B.C. to be the 'king of heat' this summer: meteorologist</p><p>Haida Gwaii Observer</p><p>Newsroom</p><p>Send email</p><p>Like the Haida Gwaii Observer on Facebook</p><p>Follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAIDAG-3810770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAIDAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7P-04T1-JDH1-C54Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438226</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Haida Gwaii Observer</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 31, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

More than one thousand fires are burning up<br/>Canadian forests right across the country. A legion of firefighters<br/>is trying to put them out. But the challenge is daunting. Hot, dry<br/>weather has sparked flames from British Columbia to Nova Scotia and<br/>the crews are exhausted. CTV's Jonathan Gravenor has more.</p><p>JONATHAN GRAVENOR [Reporter]: Edmonton is covered in a blanket of<br/>smoke created from forest fires more than 250 kilometres away. The<br/>flames are destroying valuable timber, the smoke is choking people.<br/>And the number of fires is also choking resources. With most<br/>Canadian firefighters battling blazes in BC, Alberta had to turn to<br/>the United States for help. Monday, American crews arrive.</p><p>ELIZABETH CAVASSO [US Firefighter]: When we were coming in and<br/>descending down here in Edmonton you could smell the smoke in the<br/>air craft and looking out the window we knew there was a big fire.</p><p>GRAVENOR: It's the same as Saskatchewan, a neverending battle. In<br/>Prince Albert, this group of fire evacuees is getting ready to head<br/>home. But the centre will remain open, waiting for more to come.<br/>Fire risk is extreme across the country and the numbers are<br/>staggering. There have been 8,094 fires across Canada this year.<br/>That's fifteen hundred more than normal. The fires have already<br/>consumed 2.9 million hectares of forest. Add it all up and<br/>officials think the bill to fight the fires could reach half a<br/>billion dollars this year.</p><p>SERGE POULIN [Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre]: Resources<br/>are probably at a minimum.</p><p>GRAVENOR: The Canadian Forest Fire Centre is in Winnipeg. Its job<br/>is to get the people and the equipment to where they're needed. But<br/>with so many fires and so many provinces, the system has been<br/>stretched to a breaking point.</p><p>POULIN: But there's going to come a time, if this continues, that<br/>we may have to say well we've exhausted our resources. It hasn't<br/>yet but it may.</p><p>GRAVENOR: Atlantic Canada could make the difference. It's<br/>suffering through a heatwave and the forest fire risk is extreme.<br/>In Nova Scotia, they've now closed the forest to the public. And if<br/>a major forest fire breaks out there there might not be enough<br/>firefighters or equipment to go around. Someone somewhere could<br/>suffer. What officials say they really need is cool, wet weather.<br/>What's being forecast for most of the country is hot and dry.<br/>Jonathan Gravenor, CTV News, Winnipeg.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3X1S-W7V0-00RJ-F54V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><timeReceived>23:00:00 - 23:30:00 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>CTV Television, Inc.</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 CTV Television, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"08\" day=\"10\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 10, 1998</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Smoking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUY4NDAyOEI0MkJGNDJGQTg5MTAwMTMzNjVBNjA4NkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS173</classCode><className>NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Liberal MLAs who won the most seats in the May election but found themselves in opposition as the new fall session began.</p><p>Defeated in the 2013 election by incumbent NDP MLA Norm McDonald, Clovechok said he lost in part because a B.C. Conservative candidate took enough votes to keep the result from being close. After that, he said he worked for constituents in the region as a kind of unofficial MLA, dealing with people who believed they weren't getting the representation they needed. That work, and McDonald's decision to retire from politics, secured him the seat.</p><p>\"I've been fortunate to have a lot of interesting jobs in my time, and so far, touch wood, this is the best one,\" Clovechok said in an interview.</p><p>As B.C. Liberal tourism critic and a former tourism business operator, Clovechok said he has pressed Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Lisa Beare to provide more support for businesses that are struggling and have lost much of their peak season revenue.</p><p>\"They're throwing pennies that should be dollars,\" he said.</p><p>Clovechok says his constituency has been hit hard by the forest fire season, and he has a fire burning near his own home. Smoke conditions and national media coverage combined to put people off, including toursists and people from Alberta who own vacation properties.</p><p>\"There are communities that are like ghost towns.\" he said. \"People aren't playing golf, they're not coming at all because of the smoke.\"</p><p>He said the forest industry in Columbia River-Revelstoke is doing well despite a shortage of fibre, with lumber, plywood and other producers working together to share the available supply.</p><p>Like other B.C. Liberal MLAs, he is watching as an NDP government implements policies and ramps up spending, much of it initiated by the former government.

Lasante's employer, Executive Flight Centre, was supplying fuel to the provincial government to fight a forest fire at the time. The judge's written reasons for judgement in the trial can be found here.</p><p>Mrozinski said fines in cases similar to LaSante's have ranged as high as $40,000. The crown prosecutor in this case had asked for $30,000.</p><p>Mrozinski said a fair sentence should take into account the culpability of the offender, the gravity of the offense and the offender's ability to pay.</p><p>In this case, she said, \"Mr. LaSante is moderately culpable, significant environmental damage has been caused, and the nature of the offense - the careless transport of a dangerous substance - calls for a denunciatory sentence that sends a strong message of general deterrence.\"</p><p>As for his ability to pay, Mrozinski said, \"This is not a fine he could pay with some ease, but of sufficient amount as to act as a deterrent.\"</p><p>LaSante, 40, lives in Revelstoke and works as a fuel truck driver, having been a truck driver for more than 20 years.</p><p>He read a statement in court, saying that he accepted the judge's guilty verdict and was very remorseful for the damage the accident caused, \"although what we have not talked about in this entire case is that my life could have been in danger by doing my job to the very best of my knowledge, trying to help a community in need.\"</p><p>\"I am sensitive to environmental issues like the one I caused,\" he said, adding that in his current truck driving job he is \"very aware of the load, the location, and the terrain I drive on since this incident. It is always in the back of my mind now. After this entire experience I will do everything in my power to never repeat a situation like this again.\"</p><p>At last March's trial, the provincial government, also a defendant, was found not guilty.</p><p>Executive Flight Centre was originally a defendant in the case but charges were dropped in October 2017, because delays between the initial charges and the trial prejudiced a fair hearing, leaving LaSante as the only defendant.</p><p>Since then, however, the Crown has appealed the dropped charges against the company, and won. The date of an appeal hearing has not been set.</p><p>Slocan Valley resident Marilyn Burgoon, who got this court process started by initiating a private prosecution that was eventually taken over by the federal prosecutors, had this to say after LaSante's sentencing:</p><p>\"Although I did not name the driver in my private prosecution and still feel that the responsibility starts at the top, i.e. government and corporation, I attended the entire court case and learned and agreed with the court that the driver did have some responsibility.</p><p>\"The fact that Executive Flight chose to leave him taking the fall and use the Jordan rule to try and avoid accountability for the spill is unfortunately an occurrence that repeats itself when corporations abandon their workers. I hope when Executive Flight gets to court they will be accountable for their negligence.\"</p><p>Related:</p><p>Driver found guilty in Lemon Creek case, government acquitted</p><p>L emon Creek charges stayed against fuel company</p><p>Crown wins Lemon Creek appeal against fuel company</p><p>This story was altered on Feb. 20 by adding the last three paragraphs.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com\">bill.metcalfe@nelsonstar.com</email> Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3749372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG5-2FM1-JDH1-C3YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>CONSERVATION FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

Critics say economic crisis cutbacks are hampering efforts to deal with the blazes.</p><p>The Canary Islands regional government said Wednesday that the fire on the island, which lies off the North African coast, was still out of control. But it said firefighters were making greater progress because of a sudden drop in summer temperatures and a change in wind direction that had contained the fire's spread.</p><p>The fire has so far burned just over 30 square kilometres (11. sq. miles), in and around the island's central Garajonay National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site.</p><p>The Canary Islands government has long demanded its firefighting equipment be boosted by the central government.</p><p>Agriculture Minister Miguel Angel Canete has acknowledged that cutbacks have likely affected regional governments' abilities to prevent or put out forest fires. He pledged new measures soon but gave no details.</p><p>Forest fires in Spain burned 1,300 square kilometres (500 square miles) from January through Aug. 5, the ministry says, more than triple that of the same period during 2011.</p><p>Leading newspaper El Pais on Wednesday highlighted that the blazes, while started mostly by people and abetted by drought and soaring temperatures, have coincided with severe cutbacks in spending by both regional and national governments.</p><p>\"Prevention is less costly than repairing the damage done,\" the paper said in an editorial.</p><p>Environmental organizations such as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund have for years criticized Spain for its forest fire prevention programs.</p><p>Spain is in a double dip recession with near 25 per cent unemployment. It has introduced a batch of austerity measures and financial and labour reforms to try to convince EU partners and investors that it is serious about getting its finances in shape and can avert a full blown sovereign bailout.</p><p>One of its biggest tasks is to reduce its swollen central and regional government deficits, and this has led to major cutbacks in spending by regional governments - those chiefly responsible for fighting forest fires.</p><p>On Tuesday, the cash-strapped central region of Castilla-La Mancha announced plans to cut its number of firefighters by almost a third.</p><p>Labour unions and the leading opposition Socialist party have also complained about cutbacks in firefighting efforts in other regions such as northeastern Catalonia, central Castilla y Leon and northwestern Galicia, all of which have been badly affected by blazes.</p><p>Three firefighters and three civilians - including two French tourists - have died in recent wildfires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">c9bbf08742af4f2a90cffe8af00c1d76</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56BT-NYB1-JBVR-30N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2013-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><timeReceived>09:48 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>August 15, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The project will also create two full-time biomass harvesting jobs and 12 temporary construction jobs in the local Gitxsan community.</p><p>Heart of the Hazeltons chair Peter Newberry said this summer that using the biomass system could save $50,000 a year in operating costs.</p><p>\"The Gitxsan people are very pleased to have the Government of Canada's support for such an important local project. The new Upper Skeena Recreation Centre will fill a critical community need, and the use of bio heat continues our focus on the utilization of local resources. This highly advanced technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions while cleaning up the forest floor and consuming the abundant woody biomass throughout Gitxsan territory, and this in turn cuts forest fire hazards. This project has stimulated three more GHG-reducing initiatives, and we may see more to come,\" said Gitxsan Development Corp president and CEO Rick Connors in a media release.</p><p>The massive $16-million centre that will house a rink, fitness room, gym, and a community rental space. It will also have spaces for community programming in various areas such as wellness and personal development. It will seat up to 500 spectators on heated bleachers.</p><p>READ: Tour of Upper Skeena Rec Centre</p><p>The rec centre is a rare example of many different levels and types of governments and organizations working together on a such a large project. The Regional District of Kitimat Stikine will own the facility, but it was put together with funding and efforts from all the First Nations and municipalities in the area, plus volunteers from the Heart of the Hazeltons, and the federal and provincial governments.</p><p>The School of Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia is being asked to help design a health tracking process to measure improvements in the area, and to help design a transportation system that may link with the Highway 16 transportation system and add other elements.</p><p>The wood-based construction with glulam beams is a prototype approved by the previous provincial government that can be used for future arenas built in B.C.</p><p>\"As I go around the Province I can spread the word about a project like this when communities are looking at replacing facilities, and also at the Cabinet table when we're talking about hospitals or schools or community facilities like this,\" said Stikine MLA Doug Donaldson during a summer tour of the construction site.</p><p>This is the first funding announced under the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities Program. The goal of the program is to reduce the reliance of rural and remote communities on fossil fuel for heat and power, with particular emphasis on Indigenous communities. Projects like this are meant to reduce the use of fossil fuels through the installation or retrofit of proven forest-based biomass heating options in communities or for industrial applications.</p><p>\"This project will directly benefit the community through good middle-class jobs and is a great example of how we are working with Indigenous partners to create forest-based economic development opportunities, all while helping Canada reach its climate change goals,\" said Sohi in a release.</p><p>The 5,050-sq.-ft. Upper Skeena Recreational Centre is scheduled to open this season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-3684148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJS-BXJ1-JDH1-C13W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Smithers Interior News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 23, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00068KJ</classCode><className>FIRST RESERVE MANAGEMENT LP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6799 INVESTORS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp;

In 2025, there have been 629 fires across the province, compared to 450 in 2024. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025101676990341</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H0R-F0G3-S6PY-X3D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"180\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

They are the ones that can look at transportation and infrastructure and they are the ones that can deal with zoning.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Williams Lake there is currently one air quality monitoring station at the Lake City Secondary School Columneetza campus that was refurbished in October 2017.</p><p>Read more: Williams Lake gets new air quality monitoring station</p><p>\"It measures ozone, hydrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, PM10 and PM2.5 and we have moved the weather instruments from Canadian Tire to Columneetza so we now have wind speed, wind direction, and temperature being measured there,\" Adams said. \"We have also moved the precipitation gauge there.\"</p><p>When asked why the monitoring station is placed at Columneetza Adams said the ministry tries to install them in places where there are lots of homes and people so as to get an idea what people are breathing in.</p><p>Daily and hourly readings from the monitoring station are available online by going to the air quality data government of B.C. website.</p><p>Adams said it is unlikely the city will get another monitoring station as they are very expensive, however, there is new portable equipment that is less expensive that can be moved around a community to investigate hot spots or a specific source.</p><p>\"In Quesnel, they have the main station at Quesnel Senior Secondary, and next week will be installing an instrument with e-band that is free standing and plugs into a regular extension cord and can be moved around from year to year.\"</p><p>A movable instrument would be good for Williams Lake, Adams said.</p><p>\"But in order to do that you have to develop partnerships with local government and industry in order to pay for them.\"</p><p>He said in Ontario, air quality monitoring stations are only installed in cities with more than 100,000 people.</p><p>Former city councillor and mayoral candidate Surinderpal Rathor said when he was in office he received more complaints about Pinnacle Pellet than any other industrial business and asked Adams about its emissions.</p><p>Adams responded that people should be concerned because of the visible effects on tourism and also the odors, but said he did not think there is much evidence that the current level of emissions are having a significant effect.</p><p>\"Based on what I've seen around other pellet plants, we could not find any link between air quality down wind,\" Adams said. \"I'd say the main concerns are visibility and odor.\"</p><p>Read more: Particulate matter levels in Williams Lake high enough to concern all</p><p>Jenny Noble attended the workshop and said Adams answered a lot of questions she had about pollutants that threaten air quality and impact health.</p><p>\"He stressed the invisibly small particles and liquid droplets comprising PM2.5 that result from all combustion,\" Noble said.</p><p>\"They impact our lungs forever, and can cross into the bloodstream causing cardiovascular problems.\"</p><p>Noble said Adams referred to research showing that long-term exposure, even in low quantities, is more damaging than even short-term high-level exposures like forest fire smoke.</p><p>\"Further research aims to determine whether that's true when forest fires occur year after year,\" she added.</p><p>She said she was disappointed he did not talk about the issue of rail tie burning proposed at Atlantic Power.</p><p>However, during his presentation, Adams said he could not address the issue until the appeal process through the Environmental Appeal Board is completed.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@wltribune.comLike\">news@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on

The Canadian Forces has been working since the early 2000s to find unmanned aerial vehicles that can conduct surveillance over Canada's vast territory and support overseas missions. Yet aside from purchasing a small number of temporary, unarmed drones for the war in Afghanistan, the military has never been able to make much progress on a permanent fleet. Air Force commander Lt.-Gen. Al Meinzinger says he believes that is about to change after the Trudeau government became the first to officially authorize the acquisition of a fleet of armed UAVs through its defence policy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">---</p><p>NO PROGRESS IN MEETING WITH TRUDEAU: N.B. PREMIER</p><p>New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs says his latest meeting with the prime minister produced little or no progress on major issues facing his province. Higgs met with Justin Trudeau on Tuesday in Ottawa, but the premier said there was no movement on the contentious issue of the federal government's carbon tax. New Brunswick is an intervener in legal challenges launched by Saskatchewan and Ontario and has launched its own legal challenge of the carbon tax. Higgs SAID the tax Ottawa will impose in provinces without their own carbon taxes - puts his province at a disadvantage, and if it remains in place, New Brunswickers will be paying the highest tax on gasoline by 2022.</p><p>---</p><p>ACQUITTAL DOESN'T MEAN SYSTEM IS BROKEN: JUDGE</p><p>A Newfoundland judge is making a spirited defence of how courts handle sexual assault cases, after acquitting a man despite finding the complainant credible. In a new ruling, Judge Wayne Gorman described the tricky balance of determining guilt in cases where evidence pits the word of the complainant against that of the accused. A young woman had alleged that her former employer repeatedly sexually assaulted her by touching her buttocks, and said the unwanted touching happened \"too many times to count\" in 2016 and 2017. The employer denied ever sexually touching the woman.</p><p>---</p><p>GIRL IN QUEBEC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STABBED</p><p>Provincial police say a girl in a Quebec elementary school was stabbed Tuesday afternoon during a dispute with a schoolmate. Police spokesman Hugues Beaulieu said there was an altercation between two students at the Saint-Pierre elementary school in Alma in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. He said a boy pulled out a knife and stabbed the girl, reported to be in fourth grade. She was taken to hospital but suffered only superficial wounds. The boy was taken into custody by police officers and social services, but Beaulieu says it's too early to say what will happen to him. He did not divulge the ages of the children involved.</p><p>---</p><p>WILDFIRE SMOKE LIKE A 'CHEMICAL SOUP': RESEARCHER</p><p>A researcher who studies wildfires says inhaling the smoke from a forest fire is equal to smoking a couple of packs of cigarettes a day depending on how thick it is. Professor Mike Flannigan, in the Department of Renewable Resources at the University of Alberta, says the smoke from the forest fires is like a chemical soup that can be trapped in the lungs and cause all kinds of problems.  Sarah Henderson, an environmental health scientist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, says B.C. wildfires have had a huge impact on air quality. Both Flannigan and Henderson are making presentations at the B-C Lung Association's annual workshop on air quality and health in Vancouver today.</p><p>---</p><p>ALSO IN THE NEWS:</p><p>- Former NHLer Eric Lindros will testify to the Commons' health committee on sports-related concussions.</p><p>- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh participates in the first debate for the Burnaby South byelection hosted by Friends of Canadian Broadcasting.</p><p>- A court date is set in Winnipeg today for a family, who cannot be identified, whose infant was recently seized in hospital by social workers.</p><p>- Michael McEvoy, information and privacy commissioner, will release the results of an investigation into the use of personal information by political parties in B.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d9d6b6d330f840209f2959870b26b858</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC4-WC21-JBVR-3156-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A prized 1937 Buick has already been taken away for safekeeping.</p><p>Girard won't be worried until he sees smoke but his family of four is continuously monitoring the situation by radio.</p><p>\"I get up five times a night to look around, it is very stressful,\" said his wife, Rose-Helene Thibault.

Our focus is on getting the last people out,\" said Jason Small, a spokesman for the Canadian Red Cross.</p><p>\"As long as everything goes well, we are working towards getting everybody out ... by the end of today.\"</p><p>A dry spring has led to an early forest fire season across Manitoba. There have already been 173 wildfires, compared to an average of 105 at this time of year, the province said.</p><p>The blaze near Little Grand Rapids broke out earlier this week and had grown to cover 200 square kilometres.</p><p>Chief Raymond Keeper of Little Grand Rapids said homes were damaged in his community but no one was killed.</p><p>\"Material stuff can be replaced but lives can't be, so we're very fortunate,\" Keeper said.</p><p>\"They picked up another small bundle (of people) this morning and they're just looking to see if there's any more left.\"</p><p>The fire knocked out power to the area, but crews were keeping the fire from affecting any more houses.</p><p>The chief and council at Little Grand Rapids said they had asked for help Monday and accused the federal government of being slow in responding. As well, thick smoke near the community's airport initially hampered the evacuation effort.</p><p>The Canadian Red Cross, which is in charge of the evacuation, was using chartered private planes, a military transport plane and a military Chinook helicopter. The helicopter was being used primarily in Pauingassi, which has no airport and lies 12 kilometres from Little Grand Rapids.</p><p>Small said that by Thursday afternoon, 18 people were left in Little Grand Rapids and about 200 Pauingassi residents were either still in the community or en route to Winnipeg.</p><p>The evacuation has so far been more manageable than last year, when several thousand people were evacuated from northern communities at the same time and large emergency shelters were set up in Winnipeg.</p><p>The Red Cross said the number of evacuees so far this year is smaller and there are enough hotel rooms in Winnipeg and other communities to accommodate everyone.</p><p>Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott said the federal government is fully committed to supporting the First Nation communities and evacuees.</p><p>\"Indigenous Services Canada is working in lock-step w/ Public Safety, Canadian Armed Forces, Cdn Red Cross, the Prov. of MB &amp; First Nations partners to ensure that residents are well supported throughout both the evacuation process and in their temporary placements,\" she said in a statement late Thursday.</p><p>Another fire prompted the evacuation last weekend of about 850 people from the Sapotaweyak Cree Nation. They were put up in hotels in Brandon and other centres.</p><p>About 100 people from the Kinonjeoshtogan First Nation, evacuated on Monday, were to return home Thursday.</p><p>Four water bombers from Quebec and more than 100 firefighters from Ontario have been brought to Manitoba to help fight the fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-6af2aecdd2a3424db298f35fef7965f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDB-6KJ1-DY9S-T3HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><timeReceived>10:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 24, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
