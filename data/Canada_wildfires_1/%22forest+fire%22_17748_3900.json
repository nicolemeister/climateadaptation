I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I re-member coming home from university in Vancouver\u2014a moderate climate\u2014and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \u201cwork\u201d as a clerk in my dad\u2019s general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don\u2019t have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p><p>David Zirnhelt is a rancher, member of the Cariboo Cattlemen\u2019s Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-news20210805PRDA0002047886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639G-0NY1-JD2C-J3MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

One of the reasons, forestry experts say, is that we've gotten a little too good at putting them out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change, which brings us longer, hotter, drier seasons, is also driving the increase in intensity. But part of the problem, said forestry expert Kira Hoffman, is that fire is no longer our friend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Where once we'd let forest fires burn if they weren't threatening a community or infrastructure, and where once Indigenous people would practice cultural burns - setting fires around habitation sites for safety and resource management - decades ago the needle swung toward suppressing fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result: modern-day fires find themselves with much more fuel to burn.</p><p>\"There's this kind of big shift that happens in the 1930s where we start to think of fire as really the enemy,\" said Hoffman, a post-doctoral researcher in fire ecology at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>\"(But) a lot of our forests need fire in order to survive and thrive and really be healthy. And I don't think that people really understood that very well in the past, except for Indigenous people who always knew that.\"</p><p>Indigenous cultural burning was banned by the Forest Act in the 1930s. From that point forward, the wildfire management tendency was to suppress fires.</p><p>And as techniques and equipment improved - now many fires are fought with air support and water bombers - we got more efficient at controlling and extinguishing those fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The '10 a.m. policy'</emphasis></p><p>To be fair, provinces have adopted different policies on fire management. In B.C. and Alberta, where there are logging concerns all the way north to the N.W.T. border, containment policies lean strongly toward trying to put out all fires. Hoffman calls it the \"10 a.m. policy,\" where the goal is to control a fire by 10 a.m. the day after it's spotted.</p><p>Indeed, as of Aug. 11, the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System fire map showed the majority of fires still burning in those regions were listed as \"Under Control\" or \"Being Held.\" Just across the border in N.W.T., however, the majority of fires were designated as \"Out of Control.\" The same applied to northern Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba fires.</p><p>The result of that overly efficient fire suppression, said Hoffman, has been essentially the decades-long stockpiling of tinder in the nation's forests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>We're dealing with a major backlog in fuel accumulation<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,</emphasis>\" she said. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>We've been suppressing fires so successfully for about the last hundred years, we have an accumulation of those dead and dry fuels that are becoming more dense in our forests, and then we're getting larger fire events.\"</p><p>At first glance, it appears difficult to make the case that we're overly efficient on wildfire suppression.</p><p>In Newfoundland, four active fires were burning in the central part of the island late last week, with smoke causing serious air quality problems. Premier Andrew Furey declared a state of emergency, since lifted, that advised residents of nearby communities to prepare for a potential 24-hour mandatory evacuation order.</p><p>It is, government officials said, the worst fire season in Newfoundland in 60 years.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre listed 448 active fires across the country as of Aug. 11. Of those, the vast majority - 281 - were in Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Alberta and B.C., between them, had 102 fires. And there were 36 fires burning in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.</p><p>That all seems pretty dire, but the rest of the country, Ontario and points east - Newfoundland excepted - are largely being spared from active wildfires.</p><p>For the country as a whole, the 3,067 fires that have been identified so far this season rank at only 71 per cent of the 10-year average for this point in the season.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada's data from the last 31 years shows that, overall, the number of fires per year has decreased slightly. But, significantly, the area being burned has increased slightly.</p><p>\"If you go back into the 1980s, maybe even into the 1990s, you'll see some big spikes where there's really a large area burned, but they're quite often followed by three or four or five years with a very small area burn,\" said Richard Carr, wildfire research analyst with Natural Resources Canada.</p><p>\"But what we're seeing now is more of those areas that are stacked up together with an above-average area burn,\" he said. \"We're seeing fewer years with the really small totals. Climatological studies have shown that the annual area burned will probably end up doubling sometime this century.\"</p><p>And we're seeing fires in places - like Nunavut and Vancouver Island - where we have rarely seen them before, Carr said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fewer fires, more damage</emphasis></p><p>Part of the reason is climate change. Changes in weather patterns have meant higher temperatures and less precipitation, leading to a dried landscape. Fires start more easily. And decades of fire suppression have left behind more fuel to be burned.</p><p>We're also seeing indications that fires ignited by lightning - currently about 50-50 nationwide along with humans as the leading cause of wildfires - will increase in frequency over the years.</p><p>A lightning storm over Vancouver Island last Wednesday morning produced more than 800 lightning strikes on the island, sparking 10 new fires. And in Newfoundland, all four active fires were started by lightning strikes - a phenomenon more common to Labrador - three of them on the same day.</p><p>\"Our lightning data sets aren't very old, and they keep on changing the sensors and they keep on changing the locations, so we can't say with all confidence yet, but the principle 'a warmer world should have more lightning' seems reasonable,\" said Mike Flannigan, a wildfire specialist and professor at Thompson Rivers University.</p><p>A 2015 study by Berkeley researchers published in Science in 2014, predicted a 12 per cent increase in lightning strikes across the continental U.S. for every degree of rise in global average air temperature.</p><p>As climate change creates a warmer atmosphere, vegetation - the fuel for wildfires - becomes drier. And there's more of it, meaning any given lightning strike has a greater chance of starting a fire.</p><p>Both fire-management policies and climate change have created the scenario in which we currently live: that though there are fewer fires, they cause more damage; and that those fires caused by lightning - which we can't control has a knack of starting fires in historically unusual places - are likely to increase in number.</p><p>The needle has only just begun to swing back. Hoffman, the UBC expert, said there's a huge push on for becoming friends with fire again, of adopting more \"modified responses\" to fire management.</p><p>That may include reducing fuel for future fires by letting some current fires burn unchecked.</p><p>\"I would argue that we actually need more controlled fire and more prescribed burning and more support for cultural burning so that we can start being proactive about how we engage with fire so we can coexist with fire and in a better way,\" she said. \"So, using fire to fight fire, but also using fire to manage the landscape in a way that it's been managed for a very, very long time.\"</p><p>Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

One of the reasons, forestry experts say, is that we've gotten a little too good at putting them out. <br/><br/> Climate change, which brings us longer, hotter, drier seasons, is also driving the increase in intensity. But part of the problem, said forestry expert Kira Hoffman, is that fire is no longer our friend.</p><p><br/><br/> Where once we'd let forest fires burn if they weren't threatening a community or infrastructure, and where once Indigenous people would practice cultural burns - setting fires around habitation sites for safety and resource management - decades ago the needle swung toward suppressing fires.<br/><br/> The result: modern-day fires find themselves with much more fuel to burn.<br/><br/> \"There's this kind of big shift that happens in the 1930s where we start to think of fire as really the enemy,\" said Hoffman, a post-doctoral researcher in fire ecology at the University of British Columbia.<br/><br/> \"(But) a lot of our forests need fire in order to survive and thrive and really be healthy. And I don't think that people really understood that very well in the past, except for Indigenous people who always knew that.\"<br/><br/> Indigenous cultural burning was banned by the Forest Act in the 1930s. From that point forward, the wildfire management tendency was to suppress fires.<br/><br/> And as techniques and equipment improved - now many fires are fought with air support and water bombers - we got more efficient at controlling and extinguishing those fires.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The '10 a.m. policy'</emphasis><br/><br/> To be fair, provinces have adopted different policies on fire management. In B.C. and Alberta, where there are logging concerns all the way north to the N.W.T. border, containment policies lean strongly toward trying to put out all fires. Hoffman calls it the \"10 a.m. policy,\" where the goal is to control a fire by 10 a.m. the day after it's spotted.<br/><br/> Indeed, as of Aug. 11, the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System fire map showed the majority of fires still burning in those regions were listed as \"Under Control\" or \"Being Held.\" Just across the border in N.W.T., however, the majority of fires were designated as \"Out of Control.\" The same applied to northern Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba fires.<br/><br/> The result of that overly efficient fire suppression, said Hoffman, has been essentially the decades-long stockpiling of tinder in the nation's forests.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>We're dealing with a major backlog in fuel accumulation<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,</emphasis>\" she said.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> \"</emphasis>We've been suppressing fires so successfully for about the last hundred years, we have an accumulation of those dead and dry fuels that are becoming more dense in our forests, and then we're getting larger fire events.\"<br/><br/> At first glance, it appears difficult to make the case that we're overly efficient on wildfire suppression.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/08/11/newfoundland-wildfires-could-be-sign-of-what-climate-change-has-in-store-for-province.html\">In Newfoundland</url>, four active fires were burning in the central part of the island late last week, with smoke causing serious air quality problems. Premier Andrew Furey declared a state of emergency, since lifted, that advised residents of nearby communities to prepare for a potential 24-hour mandatory evacuation order.<br/><br/> It is, government officials said, the worst fire season in Newfoundland in 60 years.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre listed 448 active fires across the country as of Aug. 11. Of those, the vast majority - 281 - were in Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Alberta and B.C., between them, had 102 fires. And there were 36 fires burning in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.<br/><br/> That all seems pretty dire, but the rest of the country, Ontario and points east - Newfoundland excepted - are largely being spared from active wildfires.<br/><br/> For the country as a whole, the 3,067 fires that have been identified so far this season rank at only 71 per cent of the 10-year average for this point in the season.<br/><br/> Natural Resources Canada's data from the last 31 years shows that, overall, the number of fires per year has decreased slightly. But, significantly, the area being burned has increased slightly.<br/><br/> \"If you go back into the 1980s, maybe even into the 1990s, you'll see some big spikes where there's really a large area burned, but they're quite often followed by three or four or five years with a very small area burn,\" said Richard Carr, wildfire research analyst with Natural Resources Canada.<br/><br/> \"But what we're seeing now is more of those areas that are stacked up together with an above-average area burn,\" he said. \"We're seeing fewer years with the really small totals. Climatological studies have shown that the annual area burned will probably end up doubling sometime this century.\"<br/><br/> And we're seeing fires in places - like Nunavut and Vancouver Island - where we have rarely seen them before, Carr said.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fewer fires, more damage</emphasis><br/><br/> Part of the reason is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/climate-change.html\">climate change</url>. Changes in weather patterns have meant higher temperatures and less precipitation, leading to a dried landscape. Fires start more easily. And decades of fire suppression have left behind more fuel to be burned.<br/><br/> We're also seeing indications that fires ignited by lightning - currently about 50-50 nationwide along with humans as the leading cause of wildfires - will increase in frequency over the years.<br/><br/> A lightning storm over Vancouver Island last Wednesday morning produced more than 800 lightning strikes on the island, sparking 10 new fires. And in Newfoundland, all four active fires were started by lightning strikes - a phenomenon more common to Labrador - three of them on the same day.<br/><br/> \"Our lightning data sets aren't very old, and they keep on changing the sensors and they keep on changing the locations, so we can't say with all confidence yet, but the principle 'a warmer world should have more lightning' seems reasonable,\" said Mike Flannigan, a wildfire specialist and professor at Thompson Rivers University.<br/><br/> A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1259100\">2015 study by Berkeley researchers</url> published in Science in 2014, predicted a 12 per cent increase in lightning strikes across the continental U.S. for every degree of rise in global average air temperature.<br/><br/> As climate change creates a warmer atmosphere, vegetation - the fuel for wildfires - becomes drier. And there's more of it, meaning any given lightning strike has a greater chance of starting a fire.<br/><br/> Both fire-management policies and climate change have created the scenario in which we currently live: that though there are fewer fires, they cause more damage; and that those fires caused by lightning - which we can't control has a knack of starting fires in historically unusual places - are likely to increase in number.<br/><br/> The needle has only just begun to swing back. Hoffman, the UBC expert, said there's a huge push on for becoming friends with fire again, of adopting more \"modified responses\" to fire management.<br/><br/> That may include reducing fuel for future fires by letting some current fires burn unchecked.<br/><br/> \"I would argue that we actually need more controlled fire and more prescribed burning and more support for cultural burning so that we can start being proactive about how we engage with fire so we can coexist with fire and in a better way,\" she said. \"So, using fire to fight fire, but also using fire to manage the landscape in a way that it's been managed for a very, very long time.\"<br/><br/> Steve McKinley is a Halifax-based reporter for the Star.

In B.C. and Alberta, where there are logging concerns all the way north to the N.W.T. border, containment policies lean strongly toward trying to put out all fires. Hoffman calls it the \"10 a.m. policy,\" where the goal is to control a fire by 10 a.m. the day after it's spotted.<br/><br/> Indeed, as of Aug. 11, the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System fire map showed the majority of fires still burning in those regions were listed as \"Under Control\" or \"Being Held.\" Just across the border in N.W.T., however, the majority of fires were designated as \"Out of Control.\" The same applied to northern Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba fires.<br/><br/> The result of that overly efficient fire suppression, said Hoffman, has been essentially the decades-long stockpiling of tinder in the nation's forests.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>We're dealing with a major backlog in fuel accumulation<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,</emphasis>\" she said.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> \"</emphasis>We've been suppressing fires so successfully for about the last hundred years, we have an accumulation of those dead and dry fuels that are becoming more dense in our forests, and then we're getting larger fire events.\"<br/><br/> At first glance, it appears difficult to make the case that we're overly efficient on wildfire suppression.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/08/11/newfoundland-wildfires-could-be-sign-of-what-climate-change-has-in-store-for-province.html\">In Newfoundland</url>, four active fires were burning in the central part of the island late last week, with smoke causing serious air quality problems. Premier Andrew Furey declared a state of emergency, since lifted, that advised residents of nearby communities to prepare for a potential 24-hour mandatory evacuation order.<br/><br/> It is, government officials said, the worst fire season in Newfoundland in 60 years.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre listed 448 active fires across the country as of Aug. 11. Of those, the vast majority - 281 - were in Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Alberta and B.C., between them, had 102 fires. And there were 36 fires burning in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.<br/><br/> That all seems pretty dire, but the rest of the country, Ontario and points east - Newfoundland excepted - are largely being spared from active wildfires.<br/><br/> For the country as a whole, the 3,067 fires that have been identified so far this season rank at only 71 per cent of the 10-year average for this point in the season.<br/><br/> Natural Resources Canada's data from the last 31 years shows that, overall, the number of fires per year has decreased slightly. But, significantly, the area being burned has increased slightly.<br/><br/> \"If you go back into the 1980s, maybe even into the 1990s, you'll see some big spikes where there's really a large area burned, but they're quite often followed by three or four or five years with a very small area burn,\" said Richard Carr, wildfire research analyst with Natural Resources Canada.<br/><br/> \"But what we're seeing now is more of those areas that are stacked up together with an above-average area burn,\" he said. \"We're seeing fewer years with the really small totals. Climatological studies have shown that the annual area burned will probably end up doubling sometime this century.\"<br/><br/> And we're seeing fires in places - like Nunavut and Vancouver Island - where we have rarely seen them before, Carr said.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fewer fires, more damage</emphasis><br/><br/> Part of the reason is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/climate-change.html\">climate change</url>. Changes in weather patterns have meant higher temperatures and less precipitation, leading to a dried landscape. Fires start more easily. And decades of fire suppression have left behind more fuel to be burned.<br/><br/> We're also seeing indications that fires ignited by lightning - currently about 50-50 nationwide along with humans as the leading cause of wildfires - will increase in frequency over the years.<br/><br/> A lightning storm over Vancouver Island last Wednesday morning produced more than 800 lightning strikes on the island, sparking 10 new fires. And in Newfoundland, all four active fires were started by lightning strikes - a phenomenon more common to Labrador - three of them on the same day.<br/><br/> \"Our lightning data sets aren't very old, and they keep on changing the sensors and they keep on changing the locations, so we can't say with all confidence yet, but the principle 'a warmer world should have more lightning' seems reasonable,\" said Mike Flannigan, a wildfire specialist and professor at Thompson Rivers University.<br/><br/> A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1259100\">2015 study by Berkeley researchers</url> published in Science in 2014, predicted a 12 per cent increase in lightning strikes across the continental U.S. for every degree of rise in global average air temperature.<br/><br/> As climate change creates a warmer atmosphere, vegetation - the fuel for wildfires - becomes drier. And there's more of it, meaning any given lightning strike has a greater chance of starting a fire.<br/><br/> Both fire-management policies and climate change have created the scenario in which we currently live: that though there are fewer fires, they cause more damage; and that those fires caused by lightning - which we can't control has a knack of starting fires in historically unusual places - are likely to increase in number.<br/><br/> The needle has only just begun to swing back.

These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services and Member of Parliament for Niagara Centre, Vance Badawey, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Member of Parliament for St. Catharines, Chris Bittle, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at the Niagara District Airport.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, the Government of Canada will provide the airport with almost $1.2 million to purchase critical safety equipment including a runway sweeper, a snow plow and a loader.</p><p>This funding is in addition to the $470,000 in Airports Capital Assistance Program funding provided to the airport in May 2021 for the purchase of a medium-sized snowblower.</p><p>This equipment will help the airport maintain safe operations for aircraft, passengers, crews and airport workers by keeping airside surfaces, such as runways and taxiways, clear of snow and ice.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over$1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The pandemic highlighted the important role Canada's local and regional airports play in our country's economy, and in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities. In addition to supporting personal travel, local and regional airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our commitment to build safer, healthier and stronger communities as Canada recovers from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra Minister of Transport</p><p>\"As we emerge from the impacts of COVID-19 and can more fully embrace the economic opportunities rapidly evolving throughout the Niagara Region, continued investments in Niagara District Airport have never been more important for our community. We continue to work with our partners to strengthen economic growth that build on our region's strengths such as the airports and the Welland Canal, both at the forefront of our charge forward to reinforce Niagara as one of the nation's strategic trade corridors.\"</p><p>Vance BadaweyParliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services and Member of Parliament for Niagara Centre</p><p>\"The investment of over $1 million provides further improvements to the safety of our airport and contributes to the growth of the economy here in Niagara Region.\"</p><p>Chris BittleParliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Member of Parliament for St. Catharines</p><p>\"We're thankful for the support of the Federal government that allows us to prioritize the safety of our travellers in Niagara, This speaks volumes to the growth in traffic that we continue to facilitate at CYSN and is a needed investment in the airport.\"</p><p>Robin GarrettChairNiagara District Airport Commission</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years. The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.

General Employees\u2019 Union (BCGEU), which represents the 1,880 employees of the BC Wildfire Service including the front-line wildfire fighters, I want to correct some points made by Mr. Quigley (A perspective on wildfire management in B.C. , Aug. 26, 2021, issue) on the role of unionization and Type 1 crews in our province\u2019s wildfire situation.</p><p>First and foremost, B.C. needs a wildfire service built around a professional core with seasonal auxiliaries.

Embers can travel for many kilometers on the wind, and land near our homes, even when a forest fire is nine kilometres away. By adopting and implementing FireSmart principles, such as removing all combustibles within 1.5 metres around your home, cleaning out under decks, raking up wood fuels and compost piles, trimming up ladder fuels (branches) and helping your neighbours to do the same, will help make a huge difference to mitigate the risks of wildfire. Post-fire studies, experiments and models have shown that homes ignite due to the condition of the home itself, like pine needles on the roof or leaves and lumber under a deck, and everything that surrounds it out to 100 metres from the foundation. Clearing these areas also make it easier for firefighters to protect your structure.</p><p>Many of these FireSmart practices also reduce human-wildlife conflict, by improving line of sight for safety, and removing shelter where animals like to bed down and burrow.</p><p>Local WildSafeBC Coordinator, Carolyn Blank, spoke about that connection, plus safety and awareness of wildlife and attractants such as garbage, birdseed, pet food, compost, fruit trees and dirty barbecues that encourage wildlife to linger near our homes. A community that has removed attractants, like Princeton, is showing fantastic improvement, with less wildlife becomes habituated, and fewer animals are removed for public safety.</p><p>While learning about these best practices, there was free pizza and drinks and multiple door prizes of WildSafeBC Ranger activity books, a Firesmart water bottle, first aid kit, vests, gloves, t-shirts, hats, a $100 gift card from The Copper Pit and two $50 gift cards from Cool Beanz Coffee House. A bear-resistant garbage bin was on site for demo and use.</p><p>The FireSmart and WildSafeBC programs are made possible by Princeton town council initiatives to bring these education programs to our community through grants from the provincial government. Mayor Spencer Coyne and Manager of Protective Services Ed Atkinson attended in support of the evening.</p><p>Many conversations were started between residents, about the simple yet effective actions they plan to take to increase their safety.</p><p>To find out what you can do to improve your safety or learn more about the FireSmart or WildSafe programs, visit their websites at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.firesmartcanada.caorwww.wildsafebc.com\">www.firesmartcanada.caorwww.wildsafebc.com</url> or email your local coordinators at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:firesmart@princeton.caor\">firesmart@princeton.caor</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:princeton@wildsafebc.com\">princeton@wildsafebc.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMSPOT-news20210729PSMA0002037006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMSPOT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6380-6DF1-F0HF-822B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438274</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

JOHN'S \u2014  On Sunday, Oct. 30, just over a month after post-tropical depression Fiona made landfall on the Southwest coast, the Hurricane Fiona benefit concert, We Stand On Guard Again, took place at the Mary Brown\u2019s Centre in St. John\u2019s. The televised concert featured a multitude of Newfoundland and Labrador's most talented musicians, including such favourites as Shanneyganock, Kellie Loder, The Irish Descendants, and Masterless Men, who performed live during the two-hour event, with all proceeds going to the Canadian Red Cross in support of Hurricane Fiona efforts. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Closing out the show was Shanneyganock, which was fitting since frontman Chris Andrews first spearheaded the event. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAfter seeing the footage of the devastation that happened on the Southwest coast, like a lot of people, I was just moved and wanted to help,\u201d said Andrews. \u201cThe only way I really knew how to help was to have a concert and raise money. We had done something similar for Igor and for Badger when it flooded, so we already had a template, and I reached out to Mayor Brian Button and asked if it would be something of interest. He said of course, so then I started from there and it all came together.\u201d </p><p>Andrews said a committee was set up to organize the benefit concert, and it consisted of new faces and those who were on the committee for Hurricane Igor relief. </p><p>\u201cWe had a lot of professional people who were able to do their jobs and get things going and happening fast,\u201d said Andrews. \u201cI got the ball rolling, but I am just part of a massive team who made this happen. I especially wanted to give a shout out to our committee. It was a volunteer committee of professionals that came together. They are the core of this event. I got it started but it was a team effort from start to finish. Also, to the artists, the corporate sponsors, and the people \u2013 the people were just amazing \u2013 there was support from all sides. Everyone wanted to be a part of it.\u201d </p><p>The concert raised $1.69 million, including the federal government's matching contributions. One of the corporate sponsors, Mary Brown's, decided against donating just 50 per cent of their days\u2019 sales, and instead chose to contribute their entire day\u2019s sales to the cause, totaling $335,000. </p><p>Darlene Giles, Creative Director at Mary Brown\u2019s said the idea to donate 100 per cent of their proceeds came directly from Greg Roberts, the owner of Mary Brown's. </p><p>\u201cIt started with him, and of course we all got on board,\u201d said Giles. \u201cGreg is a very generous man and loves his home province \u2013 and all of us at Mary Browns are very connected to community and to family \u2013 and it\u2019s just a big part of our brand. I honestly think, in the moment, Greg realized he wanted to do more, and changed it from 50 to 100 so we could give a really huge donation.\u201d </p><p>Giles said the public support made it one of their busiest days of sales across the province.  </p><p>\u201cThere were big lineups at the stores, and everybody just rallied around the idea, which was totally amazing. We did a lot of promotion around it. We did some interviews with TV and radio, and we had social media. We had e-blasts. We had VOCM radio. Everybody was talking about it. There was a lot of promotion around making it happen,\u201d said Giles. \u201cBut then I think, it\u2019s just inherent to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. They are known for their generosity and for wanting to help one another. People just wanted to help, and I think this was a great way for everyone to enjoy a meal at Mary Brown's and do a good thing at the same time.\u201d </p><p>Dan Bedell, Communications Director (Atlantic) with the Canadian Red Cross, said the funds donated will be helpful in providing relief to all of those affected by Hurricane Fiona, not just those residing within this province. The funds will be spread out over the relief effort, ensuring the Canadian Red Cross can continue to offer the necessary support to displaced households. </p><p>\u201cTypically, with a response like this, a major disaster response, there\u2019s the initial period where people are out of their homes, like we\u2019re seeing now. We\u2019re still supporting 59 people in hotels around Port aux Basques. There's the $500 payments we are making, which is separate from the government funds that we are administering, the two dollar amounts we are doing on behalf of government,\u201d explained Bedell. \u201cAs people get a better sense of what their costs are going to be, whether that be repairing or rebuilding, replacing the home and their contents, how much of that is covered by insurance, how much of that is going to be covered by the government unrelated to anything the Red Cross is doing, then we will better understand what the gap is going to be. We know there is always going to be a gap and for some that gap is going to be really big. For others it will be a little less, but that is the area where we like to come through with funds from events like this.\u201d </p><p>Bedell said this is an unimaginably difficult time for the families impacted by Fiona, and the Red Cross will continue to help. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but there\u2019s a lot of need,\u201d said Bedell. \u201cWe will do as much as we can to help those who need it the most and others who have been impacted in a significant way by this storm.\u201d </p><p>Seamus O\u2019Regan, Minister of Labour, was present for the concert and spent time on the Southwest coast in the wake of Fiona, which he admitted was difficult to witness. </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely gut-wrenching. As a reporter I had spent time on Igor, and with Igor there were a lot of roads that were hit, and therefor communities were cut off. But with this hurricane, you do have infrastructure damage, but it was peoples\u2019 homes and their personal effects,\u201d said O\u2019Regan. \u201cI always remember when I was 13 or 14 years old, growing up in Goose Bay, we had a forest fire that almost took out the town, and we had to evacuate our home and we didn\u2019t think we would see it again. Thank God the wind turned and the town was saved, but we had to pack up and sit in the middle of the tarmac of the airport, hoping the fire didn\u2019t get us, and I remember my mom being really upset. My mom is a pretty cool character, but she couldn\u2019t find the wedding photos, and that\u2019s what people lost. That\u2019s what we were finding on the beaches, hockey card collections, LPs, and photos, and that\u2019s the part that gets people. You can\u2019t replace it. That\u2019s your home. It\u2019s gut wrenching and really emotional.\u201d </p><p>O\u2019Regan said it was important for the government to go and talk to the people affected, because it gives them the ability to make more accurate decisions when it comes to providing help, and people need to be able to rely on their government in times of crisis. The federal government matching the amount raised for the Fiona benefit concert is just one of the ways they are helping. </p><p>O\u2019Regan was the one to introduce Mayor Brian Button to the crowd at Mary Brown's Centre as well as the crowd watching at home. </p><p>\u201cI wanted to introduce Brian Button because I\u2019ve met a lot of politicians and a lot of public leaders in my career, both as a reporter and as a politician staffer, and now as a politician, and he is one of the most impressive,\u201d said O\u2019Regan. \u201cHe keeps a cool head and it\u2019s not easy at all. I was just so impressed by everybody in all of these communities. People were hurting, but man, we often say \u2013 and it\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 - that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are resilient, but we really are.\u201d </p><p>Mayor Brian Button has been the face of the relief effort in Port aux Basques, but noted that he is only one of many who are working day in and day out to help everyone in their time of need. </p><p>\u201cI try to be a strong leader. I try to lead with strength and do whatever I can do, but there are times when I don\u2019t know how they do it,\u201d said Button. \u201cBut I guess they are able to do it, seeing things like this going on around them, knowing they are not alone.\u201d </p><p>Button said the outpouring of support was almost indescribable. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming to tell you the truth, and I don\u2019t know if I have the words to express the way I really felt about it. When you see it and people wanting to help, as I continue to say, it\u2019s a very long road that residents are going to have to continue to go down, and we\u2019re going to go down this road with each other, and it seems like we are not alone. People around the province and across the country have been so involved in this and so willing to want to help and try to do what they can, and to put a concert off like this, in a period of time where you see this kind of money that was raised, it\u2019s simply unbelievable.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d3843a4b2cf145aba53cdae5ad8f1e40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66W0-PKW1-JBVR-34RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1434\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 14, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospective employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver\u2014a moderate climate\u2014and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \u201cwork\u201d as a clerk in my dad\u2019s general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don\u2019t have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p><p>David Zirnhelt is a rancher, member of the Cariboo Cattlemen\u2019s Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20210729UAEA0002036902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6380-6DF1-F0HF-82H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

I'm just hoping it will be a colourful surprise for people when they're walking around, hopefully checking out the businesses now that things are starting to normalize,\" said McDonagh who is originally from Victoria, B.C.</p><p>\"Murals and public art really makes art accessible to everybody no matter who they are.

It's an animal of luck, but at the same time it's an animal that is, how can I say, it's not respected the way it should be. And I think a lot of people can resonate with that.

I had no choice but to venture up there to see if it might be a concern and would require that we move the cattle out of the area.</p><p>As it turned out, it appeared that the fire was somewhat contained and probably the result of a lightning strike a few days ago. A chopper was bucketing water to the fires and the fuel was being managed somehow with chainsaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, the forest licensees operating in the area were ready to dispatch heavy machinery to build a guard if needed.</p><p>I checked around but there were no cattle to be seen in the immediate area. I asked that we be contacted if the situation changed.</p><p>Returning home, I would spend the rest of the day ensuring water was available for the livestock at home, the garden and as a source of pumping for protecting the farmstead.</p><p>When running out to the range, riding cattle to where they should be, and rotating pastures for the home livestock to keep them gaining weight until the right time to market are all tasks in which I am engaging the grandchildren. I counsel them to keep track of the skills they learn and have them ready for prospec-tive employers.</p><p>My goal is to have some activity each day that they can report on to parents with some pride and excitement. Patience, which has not been my long suit, is slowly coming to me. I harken back to times when some older person took the time to teach me a thing or two.</p><p>Hard physical work in the heat is most difficult. I remember coming home from university in Vancouver\u2014a moderate climate\u2014and being posted by the telephone company construction boss to hand dig post holes in the blazing heat near the Fraser River.</p><p>I had experienced my introduction to \u201cwork\u201d as a clerk in my dad\u2019s general store which was a cool place to be in the summer heat what with refrigeration running full blast. Needless to say, I was a soft worker and physical activity in the heat took some getting used to.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the rising temperature of the world will challenge the next generations in a way only those living in desert environments (often of their own making) have experienced.</p><p>Plant trees if you don\u2019t have enough to shade your place. Learn to conserve water. But above all consume less CO2 producing goods. Vote with your feet as they say.</p><p>David Zirnhelt is a rancher, member of the Cariboo Cattlemen\u2019s Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20210728PSCA0002033529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637S-6RD1-F0HF-82B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Noakes</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Canadian Foreign Policy Institute's recent open letter effectively argues why buying new fighter jets is wholly unjustifiable given present and probable existential threats. Consider: forest fires this year have killed more people in Canada than enemy aircraft ever have.</p><p>Before we lose $77 billion of taxpayers' money down the drain called \"defence spending,\" we might ask ourselves why we have jet fighters in the first place. Fighters do not, in any real sense, defend Canada's airspace. Rather, we're protected by American nuclear weapons.</p><p>The only serious threat to Canada and the United States is a nuclear strike by the only country on Earth with enough missiles to overwhelm us.Thus, we co-operate to defend our airspace with early warning radars, which would detect the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and give us just enough time to retaliate. The Northern Hemisphere would be reduced to ash within a few hours, plunging the planet into an expedited climatological catastrophe that would end life as we know it.</p><p>Mutually assured destruction, grim as it is, is what protects us - and fighter jets, no matter how sophisticated, do not. It's a common misconception, but fighters cannot intercept an ICBM. Moreover, any attack by enemy strategic bombers would produce the same result.</p><p>This is why most of Canada's fighters were in Western Europe during the Cold War, and why they were equipped with nuclear bombs rather than air-to-air missiles. From the moment ICBMs replaced strategic bombers as the primary nuclear weapon delivery system until the end of the Cold War, Canada had but a few dozen fighter aircraft available for air defence. Occasionally, they would intercept a Soviet bomber on a training flight to Cuba.</p><p>The acquisition of our F-18s in the late 1970s made a lot of sense, given they were based in West Germany to defend NATO against an attack by the Warsaw Pact. We couldn't have picked a better fighter, but the end of the Cold War meant Canada had a number of sophisticated combat aircraft and no use for them. Successive governments sought every opportunity to employ the aircraft in combat roles, essentially to justify their cost to taxpayers.</p><p>It's a point worth considering: Canada has only ever used its F-18s to bomb countries that posed absolutely no threat to us. Moreover, our F-18s have never bombed a country into democracy, stability or prosperity. Wherever they have gone, only misery has followed.</p><p>Now we're expected to replace them because some of our politicians wish for Canada to remain in NATO, a defence alliance designed to counter the threat posed by a country that no longer exists.</p><p>Any nation so foolish it would actually consider spending $77 billion on combat aircraft to fight a war we won 30 years ago probably needs to be reminded you can't shoot down a forest fire or bomb the pandemic.</p><p>Taylor C.

But the enthusiasm and intrepidness of Harris, who was known as the unofficial leader of the group, undoubtedly saw them through. </p><p>Public art galleries and private collections still feature the works that were envisioned in rough sketches on those hikes in the early 1920s in Marathon, as well as other Lake Superior locales, like Port Coldwell. </p><p>Though few can capture a colourful landscape like the Group of Seven, many can hike. In Lake Superior\u2019s coastal hills, tourists have begun to discover the wondrous sights that Harris and his colleagues drank in \u2014 with better footwear and much lighter gear. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many people realize that these places still exist,\u201d Group of Seven Lake Superior Trail Association project co-ordinator Kirsten Spence said this week. </p><p>\u201cIt all looks the same (as in Harris\u2019s time) \u2014 the islands and the (distinctive) shafts of light\u201d that Harris depicted in his paintings. </p><p>One year Harris was inspired by the remains of a significant forest fire, which left the terrain \u201cright down to the bones.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe liked the stark, naturalness of the landscape,\u201d said Spence, who noted her association\u2019s friendly relationship with the Toronto-area McMichael art gallery, which features many of the Group of Seven\u2019s most notable paintings. </p><p>The non-profit association currently oversees about 35 kilometres of marked trail between Pukaskwa National Park and Lake Superior\u2019s Sturdee Cove just east of Marathon. </p><p>Though the association operates on a modest budget of $170,000, it is planning additional \u201cgateway signage\u201d in addition to a small exhibit erected just east of Marathon on Highway 17. </p><p>Harris, who sold quite a few paintings and was not adverse to making money, might have been heartened to know that the trails he helped blaze nearly a century earlier might be helping to give local economies a boost. </p><p>Spence said so-called \u201ctrail tourism,\u201d in which tourists plan a vacation around a series of day hikes, is on the rise. </p><p>No less than the Conference Board of Canada weighed in earlier this year in formal fashion. </p><p>\u201cTrails are a powerful asset that drives economic development while also preserving our natural heritage,\u201d the board said in a news release. </p><p>\u201cThe evidence is clear that trails have many benefits for individuals and the economy,\u201d said conference board senior economist Swapna Nair. \u201cThe health benefits include improved physical and mental health outcomes due to increased activity levels. </p><p>Marathon Mayor Rick Dumas said the economic potential of the town\u2019s link to the Group of Seven mystique justified the municipality spending $60,000 two years in a row to help promote the connection to some of the country\u2019s most celebrated art. </p><p>\u201cWe had a big (promotional) event planned for Toronto in April 2020, but COVID hit,\u201d Dumas said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll still try and do that, maybe next spring.\u201d </p><p>In Marathon alone, locals and tourists alike have easy access to two hiking trails \u2014 Peninsula Hill and the aptly-named Painter\u2019s Peak \u2014 that feature landscapes that have been immortalized on Group of Seven canvasses. </p><p>Spence, a geographical designer by training as well as a life-long traveller, said the Group of Seven\u2019s stomping grounds have become a significant passion.: \u201cIt really is one of the nicest places to go for a hike.\u201d </p><p>More information is available on the trail association\u2019s website at groupofseventrail.com. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7e442f509f0345348e247f1e92fc591a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63WT-Y8K1-JBVR-310R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><timeReceived>00:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 21, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Exposures to wildfires grew almost 20 per cent in that time, but not uniformly, with Indigenous Peoples at much higher risk.</p><p>First Nations people living on a reserve are 33 times more likely to be forced to evacuate due to a forest fire than people living off reserve, the Lancet report said.</p><p>The authors also said that in 2020, heat caused the loss of more than 22 million hours of potential labour in Canada, harming human health and productivity at the same time.</p><p>Globally, climate change left almost one-fifth of the world's land surface in extreme drought in 2020. Between 1950 and 1999, that value never exceeded 13 per cent.

There\u2019s been no word on how Biden will handle the issue, even with pressure building on him. The White House has suggested there would be some kind of income criteria that would prevent high earners from benefiting. </p><p>Debt payments were paused by President Donald Trump near the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and Biden has kept the freeze in place while considering a more permanent solution. </p><p>Any decision carries political risks. Republicans accuse Biden of plotting an election-year giveaway. Activists are pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 per borrower, and anything less could disappoint them.</p><p>\u201cPresident Biden, canceling $10,000 in student debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. Black students and other students of color are more likely to take out loans to pay for college. </p><p>The announcement about Corinthian, which operated from 1995 to 2015, seeks to close the books on one of the most notorious cases of fraud in American higher education. At its peak, Corinthian was one of the largest for-profit college companies, with more than 100 campuses and more than 110,000 students at its Everest, WyoTech and Heald schools.</p><p>When Harris was California's attorney general, she worked with the Obama administration to uncover how campuses were falsifying data on the success of their graduates. In some cases, schools reported that students had found jobs in their fields of study even though they were working at grocery stores or fast food chains.</p><p>Students told investigators they were often pressured to enroll with promises of lucrative employment, only to end up with huge sums of debt and few job prospects. Federal officials found that the company falsely told students their course credits could be transferred to other colleges.</p><p>Harris said Corinthian tried to attract students who were single parents or unemployed and looking to improve their lives.</p><p>\u201cThe company believed they could get away with it because, as predators are wont to do, they targeted people who they assumed wouldn\u2019t fight back,\u201d she said. </p><p>Tens of thousands of former Corinthian students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but they had to file paperwork and navigate an application process that advocates say is confusing. Now, the relief will be made automatic and extended to additional borrowers.</p><p>Those with a remaining balance on their Corinthian debt will also get refunds on payments already made, department officials said. But the action does not apply to loans paid in full. A spokesperson for the Education Department did not respond to a question about why that decision was made. </p><p>The Corinthian scandal led to a federal crackdown on for-profit colleges, and the Obama administration promised to forgive loans for Corinthian students whose programs lied about job placement rates. That administration went on to expand a process known as borrower defense to repayment, which allows any defrauded student to apply for debt cancellation.</p><p>The Trump administration drew criticism when it started granting only partial loan cancellation to defrauded students, giving lower levels of relief to those with higher incomes. Former Corinthian students sued, and a federal judge halted the policy and ordered the Education Department to stop collecting payments on Corinthian debt.</p><p>The Biden administration later announced full cancellation for all Corinthian students who had been given only partial forgiveness, but thousands of others were left waiting for the department to process their relief applications.</p><p>As of December, the department reported it had more than 109,000 pending applications from students alleging fraud by their colleges, mostly in the for-profit industry. </p><p>Libby DeBlasio Webster, senior counsel for the advocacy group Student Defense, called it a \u201cfresh start\u201d for former Corinthian students, but she noted that many defrauded students from other for-profit colleges are awaiting help.</p><p>She said she hopes the news \u201cis a sign that other decisions are on the horizon for thousands of similarly situated students who are waiting for this kind of relief.\u201d</p><p>Former Corinthian student Nathan Hornes had his debt forgiven in 2017 through the borrower defense process, but his sister Natasha is among the 560,000 former Corinthian students now getting cancellation.</p><p>\u201cMy sister and all the others who went through the same experience of being cheated by Corinthian finally get to experience the same relief of having the financial burden lifted,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve that too, and I\u2019m so glad that today they finally get to feel that freedom.\u201d</p><p>A for-profit college trade group said students who are deceived by their colleges deserve relief, but that Corinthian's actions \u201cdo not represent all private career schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe (Education) Department and others should not conflate the actions of one organization with an entire sector that has provided opportunities for millions of students and contributed to our nation\u2019s workforce,\" said Jason Altmire, president and CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

State of Emergency (SOE) to bring attention to more than 300 fires burning across the province-60 of them in the Cariboo.</p><p>CRD Chair Margo Wagner said the board voted Friday morning, July 16, to send a letter to the Premier, following on the heels of a local CRD state of emergency for the region issued Thursday night. The Thompson Nicola Regional District Board also voted to send a letter seeking a provincial SOE declaration Thursday, while the District of 100 Mile Council passed a similar resolution Friday.</p><p>The call came as Environment Canada predicted a 60 per cent chance of rain with a risk of thunderstorm for 100 Mile House over the weekend. Environment Canada has also been issuing special air quality statements for the Cariboo on and off for the last two weeks.</p><p>\u201cIt raises the concerns and profile of the province that we\u2019re in a major state of emergency,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cMy concern is post 2021 because we still have a lot of mental health issues still carried over from 2017, there\u2019s still lot of triggers going on-the fires are close and stressing people out and then we had COVID.

But he warned that rising temperatures and a changing wind forecast for the weekend could bring more bad news.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t exclude a new restart of the fire,\u201d he said.</p><p>The fire, now in its fifth day, has killed two people since it started Monday, a man in his 50s who died at his home in Grimaud, about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) inland from Saint Tropez, and a 32-year-old woman on vacation in the same village. </p><p>Mayors of impacted towns held a meeting on Friday to assess the situation.</p><p>\u201cThe coming three days will be decisive,\u201d the regional government said in a statement. The entire forested area remains at \u201cvery serious\u201d risk of fire with access \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d</p><p>Since Monday, the blaze has eaten through 8,100 hectares (20,015 acres) of forests and other vegetation, including vineyards.</p><p>More than 1,000 firefighters with 250 trucks worked through the night to secure the edges of the blaze so flames would not spread before daylight allowed flyovers by water-dumping aircraft to resume, the Var government said.</p><p>The blaze, which has forced the evacuation of some 10,000 people from summer campers to residents, is the latest among numerous large wildfires to have scorched the Mediterranean region this summer. Forest fires have left areas in Greece, Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain in smoldering ruins. </p><p>Hundreds of fires in Greece this month came in the wake of the country\u2019s worst heat wave in about three decades that left shrubland and forests parched. The causes of all fires have not been officially established, although more than a dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of arson.</p><p>A major wildfire that has decimated a pine forest and burned homes northwest of Athens appeared somewhat abated Friday, although hundreds of firefighters were still working to fully contain the blaze. </p><p>The fire near the village of Vilia, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) from the Greek capital, broke out Monday. Firefighters had been facing particularly tough conditions, including lack of access roads into the dense forest, high temperatures, dry conditions and constantly changing winds, he said. </p><p>In a sign of the reach large fires can cause in terms of impact, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity said on Friday that an earlier forest fire in southern France resulted in the Iberian peninsula being disconnected from the rest of the continental grid for 37 minutes last month.</p><p>Many parts of the world have seen summer wildfires fueled by extreme heat and drought conditions. Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving such extreme weather events, and that the world will see more and more of them as the planet warms.</p><p>___</p><p>Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP's coverage of climate change issues at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-38dc16e406e17d49268c6cfbee47b626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DT-PKW1-JBVR-33B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"530\"/><timeReceived>01:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 20, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The message from Mother Nature was unmistakable: \"Act immediately to mitigate climate change.\"</p><p>To heed nature's warning, I propose the \"Lytton test.\" Whatever we're planning to do collectively, we must ask: Will this help avoid another Lytton? Will it provide protection during another Lytton-like event? Does it consume resources that would be better spent mitigating the climate crisis?</p><p>If we utilize this test on the spectacularly expensive purchase of 88 new fighter jets, the Liberal's plan fails on all three fronts.</p><p>Fighter jets can't protect us from another Lytton-like catastrophe. They can't extinguish fires, carry personnel to disaster zones or offer effective search and rescue. They are offensive weapons designed to enhance the Canadian Air Force's ability to participate in future U.S. and NATO-led wars.</p><p>To fly at high speeds and altitudes, fighter jets consume incredible amounts of specialized fuel. The heavy carbon-emitting fuels' high-altitude release point also has a greater warming effect. Most fuel is consumed in training, but during the 2011 bombing of Libya, the Air Force's jets consumed 8.5 million litres of fuel.</p><p>The planned purchase would be the second largest procurement in Canadian history, diverting resources from efforts to mitigate the prospect of future Lyttons. The government says it plans to spend $19 billion on new jets. But that's just the sticker price. Depending on whether they select Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter, Saab's Gripen or Boeing's Super Hornet, the true cost could be four times greater. According to a recent report released by the No Fighter Jets Coalition, the life cycle cost is estimated at $77 billion. Those resources could turbocharge a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Moving forward with this purchase is a decision we will soon regret. Fortunately, there's growing opposition.</p><p>A public letter released this week by the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute and the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace opposes the purchase. \"As wildfires blaze in Western Canada amidst record breaking heat waves, the Liberal government is planning to spend tens of billions of dollars on unnecessary, dangerous, climate-destroying fighter jets,\" begins a letter addressed to Trudeau.</p><p>Initiating signatories include Canadian musicians Neil Young, Sarah Harmer and Tegan and Sara, as well as authors Yann Martel, Gabor Mat\u00e9 and Michael Ondaatje. The No New Fighter Jets for Canada statement is also signed by environmentalists David Suzuki and Naomi Klein, two sitting MPs, four former MPs, a senator and former diplomat Stephen Lewis. Prominent international figures like rock legend Roger Waters, actress Daryl Hannah and academic Noam Chomsky have also endorsed the call.</p><p>What happened in Lytton must prompt a profound rethink in government policy. Buying 88 offensive, unnecessary and climate-destroying fighter jets certainly doesn't meet the Lytton test.</p><p>Bianca Mugyenyi is director of the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210716TTA2021071661561678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6354-7HC1-F197-52P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Perfect for inside homes, camps, cabins and shops, this extinguisher automatically activates the moment the air temperature reaches 57C. Compared to traditional fire extinguishers that need to be turned upside down every month and re-charged yearly so they don't become ineffective, the GFS is an excellent alternative.</p><p>The WASP Wildfire sprinklers are another great product \u2013 inexpensive, easy to install, and with a record of saving houses from airborne forest fire embers, making them the perfect solution for those with buildings surrounded by forests.</p><p>And through Fire North, you can also rent, lease or purchase one of WASP's top-of-the-line Type II Structure Protection Units.

(TSX: TCW) (\" Trican\" or the \" Company\") is pleased to announce its first quarter results for 2023. The following news release should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\"), the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes of Trican for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as well as the Annual Information Form (\"AIF\") for the year ended December 31, 2022. All of these documents are available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/e45rpcLDNk\">www.sedar.com</url> .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trican's results for the quarter were significantly improved with continued strong industry and moderating inflation leading to a more sustainable margin profile resulting in improvements in all major financial categories:</p><p> Revenue was $297.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a 36% increase compared to $218.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p> Adjusted EBITDAS 1 and adjusted EBITDA 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $82.9 million and $81.6 million, compared to $42.0 million and $38.9 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p> Free cash flow 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $69.5 million compared to $30.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p> Profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $46.0 million compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.</p><p> The Company's balance sheet remains in excellent shape with positive working capital, including cash, of $180.6 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $169.4 million at December 31, 2022, providing significant financial flexibility.</p><p>Trican operates the newest, most technologically advanced fleet of fracturing equipment in Canada and successfully deployed Canada's first next generation fracturing fleets in 2022. This was accomplished by significantly upgrading existing equipment and incorporating CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (\"DGB\") engine technology. The Tier 4 DGB engine displaces up to 85% of the diesel used in a conventional pumper with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. The upgrades also include industry leading continuous duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies.</p><p>Trican began the year operating three fleets of Tier 4 DGB equipment for a total of 126,000 HHP and is extremely pleased with the operational and financial performance of these assets.</p><p> During the first quarter of 2023, Trican's fourth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) was deployed into the field bringing Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 168,000 HHP.</p><p> Upgrades to Trican's fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) are underway with equipment anticipated to be field ready by early 2024 which will bring Trican's total tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP.</p><p> Tier 4 upgrades are a key component of Trican's Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") strategy. Our ongoing ESG initiatives, including fleet upgrades, will reduce our environmental impact, improve efficiency and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations and supporting our key customers in achieving their ESG goals.</p><p> RETURN OF CAPITAL </p><p> The Company continues to be active in its normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:</p><p> During the three months ended March 31, 2023, Trican repurchased and cancelled 9,844,000 common shares, at a weighted average price of $3.31 per share, equating to approximately 4% of 229,776,553 outstanding shares at December 31, 2022.</p><p> On October 3, 2022, the Company announced the renewal of its NCIB program, commencing October 5, 2022, to purchase up to 23.1 million common shares for cancellation before October 4, 2023, subject to the TSX NCIB rules. All common shares repurchased under the NCIB are returned to treasury for cancellation. As at March 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased and cancelled 12,867,900 common shares under the 2022-2023 program. Subsequent to March 31, 2023, the Company repurchased an additional 1,667,700 common shares.</p><p> Since the initiation of our NCIB programs in 2017, Trican has repurchased 134,679,999 common shares, equating to approximately 39% of total shares outstanding at the start of the NCIB programs.</p><p> The Company has added an additional component to its return of capital strategy by instituting a quarterly dividend program:</p><p> During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.04 per share, or approximately $8.9 million in aggregate to shareholders.</p><p> On May 11, 2023, the Company's board of directors approved a dividend of $0.04 per share with distribution to be made on June 30, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2023. The dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.</p><p> FINANCIAL REVIEW </p><p> \u00a0 </p><p> Source: Bloomberg, Bank of Canada, Nickle's Energy Group, Rig Locator </p><p> OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS </p><p> Capital Expenditures </p><p> Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2023, totaled $19.5 million ($21.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022) related primarily to maintenance capital and our Tier 4 DGB fleet upgrade program. The Company's preliminary 2023 growth, maintenance, and infrastructure capital budget has been set at $113.8 million. Capital expenditures are funded with available cash resources and free cash flow.</p><p> Financial Position </p><p> We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow and our financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including investment in our Tier 4 DGB upgrade program, continued participation in our NCIB program, and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.</p><p> OUTLOOK </p><p> Our outlook for the industry remains consistent with our views outlined in Trican's fourth quarter 2022 MD&amp;A. Global demand for oil and natural gas is expected to remain strong and will likely grow as the world's major economies continue to rely on petroleum products for many products that people use for modern day life. Oil and natural gas derivatives are used as the basis for a variety of products including mobile phones, life-saving medical supplies, fuel for cars and trucks, energy to power factories, heat homes and buildings. Ongoing geopolitical tensions have driven many countries to focus on securing reliable sources of energy that are developed in an environmentally sustainable manner. Given our high environmental and regulatory standards, Canada will play an increasingly important role as a supplier of choice for both oil and natural gas. Additional export capacity is in the late stages of construction through the Trans Mountain pipeline, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline and several LNG export facilities on the west coast of Canada to ensure that Canada is well positioned to provide a long-term supply of sustainably developed oil and natural gas to the world. These factors serve to provide a positive backdrop for oil and natural gas development activity in Western Canada and the associated oilfield services required as we move through 2023 and beyond.</p><p> Despite significant commodity price volatility, activity levels in the first quarter of 2023 were very strong. Financial sector stresses and perceived recessionary risk factors were somewhat mitigated by a proactive supply cut of oil from OPEC+ members coupled with issues involving Russian oil supply. Some customers were not able to complete their anticipated first quarter programs due to cold weather delaying operations at the beginning of 2023 and the relatively rapid onset of spring break-up conditions. In recent years, our customers have moved to completing more of their drilling and completions activity in the second quarter due to larger multi-well pad designs. As a result, we anticipate second quarter activity to be steady as work expected to be performed in the first quarter carries forward and is completed in Q2 2023.</p><p>Trican is closely monitoring the forest fires active in Alberta. At this time, Trican's operations have not been significantly impacted by fire interruptions. We will continue to monitor forest fire activity as there is the potential for ongoing fire activity to cause work planned for Q2 2023 to be moved into Q3 2023.</p><p> Canadian market fundamentals remain strong for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing services for the remainder of the year. Based on our estimates for activity in 2023, we expect the Canadian fracturing market to effectively be in balance for the first half of 2023. Recent announcements from certain First Nations in Northeastern British Columbia have provided more certainty around sustainable access for our customers. This has resulted in a rebound in well licensing that should lead to an increase in development activity starting in the second half of 2023. The Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta remains one of the premier resource plays in North America and we expect that the combination of attractive economics, future demand from LNG export facilities and improved relations with First Nations will lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing services which should directly benefit Trican.</p><p>Trican has invested significantly in our equipment fleet over the last two years to ensure that we are on the forefront of pressure pumping technology and design in Canada. Demand for our Canadian market leading low emissions Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets is very robust and expected to grow in 2023 as more equipment is deployed in the field. We are currently in the process of upgrading our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB fracturing equipment containing high pressure pumps and is anticipated to be field ready in early 2024.</p><p> To further reduce emissions and fuel costs from diesel consumption, we continue to invest and enhance our equipment offering and have recently developed fully electric versions of certain ancillary equipment required for onsite fracturing operations and are deploying them into our operations going forward. This equipment includes sand handling, fracturing blending equipment and equipment used on-site for chemical blending. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow 1 as well as our financial flexibility allows for continued progress in our Tier 4 DGB and electrification upgrade program.</p><p> Industry pricing fundamentals have improved significantly over the past 12 - 18 months and we have worked hard to offset significant inflation in our cost structure. We will work diligently to ensure that we mitigate supply chain challenges such as long lead times on key parts and components. We continue to experience inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain but at a much lower rate of change than experienced in 2022. Demand for Canadian pressure pumping services remains strong, we face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the oilfield services industry which has increased our operating costs.</p><p> We will continue to serve our customers with state-of-the-art equipment and generate industry-leading returns in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. In turn, this will allow Trican to focus on returning capital to our shareholders both through our ongoing NCIB program and our quarterly dividend program. We believe our ability to deliver a multi-layered return of capital strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet will lead to long-term value creation for our shareholders.</p><p> COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS </p><p> Sales Mix - % of Total Revenue </p><p> NON-GAAP MEASURES </p><p> Certain terms in this News Release, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAS, adjusted EBITDA percentage, adjusted EBITDAS percentage and free cash flow, do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.</p><p> Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAS </p><p> Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP term and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to translate historical variability in the Company's principal business activities into future financial expectations. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, taxation strategy and non-cash charges, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities.</p><p> Adjusted EBITDAS is a non-GAAP term and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance, cash flow to complement profit / (loss) and to provide meaningful comparisons of operating results.</p><p> The items included in this calculation of adjusted EBITDA have been specifically identified as they are non-cash in nature, subject to significant volatility between periods, and / or not relevant to our principal business activities. Items adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDA, are as follows:</p><p> Non-cash expenditures, including depreciation, amortization, impairment of non-financial assets, and equity-settled share-based compensation;</p><p> Consideration as to how the Company chose to generate financial income and incur financial expenses, including foreign exchange expenses and finance costs;</p><p> Taxation in various jurisdictions; and</p><p> Other income / expense which generally results from the disposition of equipment, as these transactions generally do not reflect quarterly operational field activity.</p><p> The item adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDAS from adjusted EBITDA, is as follows:</p><p> Cash-settled share-based compensation.</p><p> Adjusted EBITDA % and Adjusted EBITDAS % </p><p> Adjusted EBITDA % and adjusted EBITDAS % is determined by dividing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAS, respectively, by revenue. The components of the calculations are presented below:</p><p> Free Cash Flow </p><p> Free cash flow is a non-GAAP term and has been reconciled to cash flow from operations for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management believes free cash flow to be a key measure of capital management as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate monies available to fund future growth through capital investments and return capital to our shareholders.</p><p> Management believes that such a measure provides an insightful assessment of the Company's operations on a continuing basis by adjusting for other (income) / loss, realized (gain) / loss, non-cash income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows, net changes in other liabilities and change in non-cash operating working capital.</p><p> Management alternatively reconciles free cash flow from adjusted EBITDA for the applicable financial periods as it believes that such a measure provides an insightful assessment of the Company's operating performance by adjusting for interest paid, income tax received, and maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows.</p><p> Free cash flow is not a standardized measure and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities.</p><p> OTHER NON-STANDARD FINANCIAL TERMS </p><p> In addition to the above non-GAAP financial measures, this News Release makes reference to the following non-standard financial terms. These terms may differ and may not be comparable to similar terms used by other companies.</p><p> Revenue Per Job </p><p> Calculation is determined based on total revenue divided by total job count. This calculation is significantly impacted by factors such as the relative revenue contribution by service line, changes in pricing and the magnitude of customer supplied consumables and inputs.</p><p> Maintenance and Growth Capital </p><p> Term that refers to capital additions as maintenance or growth capital. Maintenance capital are expenditures in respect of capital additions, replacements or improvements required to maintain ongoing business operations. Growth capital refers to expenditures primarily for new items and/or equipment that will expand our revenue and/or reduce our expenditures through operating efficiencies. The determination of what constitutes maintenance capital expenditures versus growth capital involves judgement by management.</p><p> FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS </p><p> Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking information and statements (collectively \"forward-looking statements\").

The weather is a little warm for walking these days, and when these tourists strike such a nice summer resort like Ashcroft they can not resist the temptation to pay a visit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Athletic Association:The Ashcroft Athletic Association is short of funds and it will be necessary for some one to \u201cdig up\u201d. A committee was appointed some time ago to look after this, and if the people of Ashcroft want to see the boys partake in matches with neighbouring towns they should assist the boys somewhat. So when the committee comes around donate your mite. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, push it along.\u201d</p><p>100 YEARS AGO:MAY 26, 1922$32,000 For Oregon Jack Hill; Public Works Department To Spend $1,500,000 During Coming Season:Approximately $1,500,000 will be spent on the highways of British Columbia this year. In the Cariboo district $18,000 will be spent between Miles 208 and 210 and $17,000 in gravelling between Miles 88 and 91 on the main Cariboo road. It will cost $27,000 for road diversions in the Chase-Squilax-Sorrento district near Kamloops. Hard-surfacing to cost $10,000 will be done at Salmon Arm. The sum of $32,000 is set aside for the Oregon Jack Hill road diversion in the Yale district. [This year\u2019s budget for improvements to 450km of roads in the Southern Interior alone is $113 million.]</p><p>24th Of May Picnic; Fine Weather And Good Grounds Makes Picnic Enjoyable And Successful:The 24th of May picnic which took place in one of the orchards of C.A. Semlin, Cache Creek, on Wednesday will remain in the annals of Ashcroft as one of the most enjoyable of its kind ever taken place here. A long programme had been drawn out by the teachers and school board. The prizes were part money and part little articles and candy. Ice cream, candies, and oranges were given out during the afternoon.</p><p>A dance was given by the manager of the town hall in the evening as a sort of finishing touch to the picnic. A large crowd attended and enjoyed themselves.</p><p>75 YEARS AGO:MAY 29, 1947 Mountain On Fire:The whole mountain top for miles across the Bonaparte from Hat Creek is a blaze of fire among the tall timbers. A number of forest fire fighters are out the past few days in efforts to check its progress. Smoke from the fire rolled over Ashcroft yesterday brought down by an east or north wind. There is no trace of the fire\u2019s origin.</p><p>The Annual School Picnic:Splendid weather and no mosquitoes attended the annual 24th of May picnic held at the Hat Creek farm [now Historic Hat Creek Ranch] kindly donated by Mr. Basil Jackson for the occasion. And it might be an appropriate time to say the Ashcroft Queen Victoria Birthday picnics have been held on Mr. Jackson\u2019s farm for the past twenty years, the first being in 1927. In very early times, the \u201cgay nineties\u201d [1890s] for example, Ashcroft went to Savona to celebrate, where we sometimes met Kamloops people on a similar mission, and joined forces; then we used to field on the Semlin Ranch, Cache Creek for some years, finally having to throw ourselves at the mercy of Mr. Jackson. The field was in ideal condition, the Bonaparte clear, not too high and safe for the children who enjoyed bathing.</p><p>Ashcroft Manor:From hitching post to gas station can be said of the Ashcroft Manor Auto Camp and gas station. Here years ago freight wagons stopped and tethered their horses to hitching posts or in the barn and teamsters and stage coach passengers lodged over night. Those were the good old days, but Allan Parker, present owner and operator of the Ashcroft Manor Auto Camp, has since modernized the place for present day tourists. Clean cabins, green, shady grounds, and every convenience has been installed. Ashcroft Manor is on the old historic Cariboo wagon road, now widened and hard-surfaced, just four miles from Ashcroft, and like an oasis in a desert, stands out with all its cool, shady trees. Motorists can fill up with Shell gas and oil, rest for an hour or so or over night or a week, and here enjoy the real drybelt atmosphere, the land of sunshine.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO:MAY 25, 1972 20 Minutes From Death:Scott McKenzie was bitten by a four-foot rattler last weekend. Ernie Lehti and wife were going fishing and needed earth worms, so they went to Scott McKenzie. They were approaching the vegetable garden when a rattling sound was heard. McKenzie, \u201cPeg-leg\u201d as he is known, said he would get the rattler and grabbed a fork and stabbed the reptile several times. The four-foot snake curled around the fork, \u201cPeg-leg\u201d was just going to pick the reptile up and picked the wrong end and was bitten in the finger. Within five minutes he became violently ill and his arm began to swell. Lehti\u2019s old \u201960 Pontiac isn\u2019t the fastest thing on the highway, but he said he made it to Ashcroft hospital in good time. By this time \u201cPeg-leg\u201d was partially blind. More time was spent at the hospital while a doctor was located and several anti-venom shots had to be administered before they took effect. The doctor said another 20 minutes and \u201cPeg-leg\u201d would not have pulled through. The incident occurred about eight miles east of Spences Bridge, and is an experience that \u201cPeg-leg\u201d will not forget, you can bet on that!! Cache Creek News:Tourist season is once again here with all its benefits and problems. Sewer treatment plant problems always increase in the tourist season. Owners of swimming pools are requested to drain swimming pools during the week, not on weekends, as the large volume of water creates problems at the treatment plant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20220526PPIA0002705773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J7-G831-JD2C-J276-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Well, experts have noted volcanic activity throughout the years, particularly since 1975.

The idea for this (report) is to make recommendations toward the starting place where nations can start to really bring fire back on the land and then begin to take on leadership opportunities,\u201d said Christianson. </p><p>The report identifies five barriers to the return of cultural burning as an accepted method to prevent fires: perceptions, authority and jurisdiction; governance, laws and management; access, accreditation and training; liabilities and insurance; and capacity and resources. </p><p>To address these barriers, the report calls for: </p><p>- the establishment of a National Indigenous Wildfire Stewardship working group; </p><p>- the development of a network of Indigenous and non-Indigenous fire practitioners and researchers within each province and territory to identify key policy barriers for reintroducing cultural burning;   </p><p>- giving equal priority to Indigenous knowledge; </p><p>- training and accrediting firefighters outside of wildfire management agencies; and </p><p>- increasing financial support for Indigenous fire stewardship. </p><p>These barriers and the calls to action underscore the fact that \u201cin Canada right now fire management is all the western system,\u201d said Christianson. </p><p>Part of that western system, she adds, conflates prescribed burns with cultural burning, with western agencies claiming they are taking into account Indigenous knowledge. But the two are not the same. </p><p>\u201cFor Indigenous people, because the objective around cultural burning is so different, you\u2019re not achieving the same thing. Yes, they're putting fire on the landscape, but for many Indigenous nations its not being done in the right way or for the right reasons,\u201d said Christianson. </p><p>While cultural burning does provide a means to control and suppress fire, it\u2019s also a practise that is used by Indigenous peoples \u201cto maintain desirable ecosystem structures and enhance diversity and productivity of species for food, medicine and ceremony,\u201d reads the report. </p><p>\u201cIndigenous-led fire management\u2026is looking wholistically at the problem of fire and what's needed from all angles and a big part of that is the pre-fire stuff, the cultural burning and the landscape management. It\u2019s looking at water and other things in our nations; just the health of our territories,\u201d said Christianson. </p><p>While it will take time to remove the barriers identified in the report, Christianson does say that in the 10 years she has been a fire research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, the past five years have seen some movement. </p><p>\u201cSince we've been having some more extreme fire events in Canada, I think people start looking for other solutions so\u2026there has been a lot more interest in Indigenous knowledge and cultural burning practices,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cWe are seeing some changes happening but I think for Indigenous people it's never enough. We always want more. We're looking out five to 10 years, but at the same time in the face of climate change, I think for many nations that isn't fast enough. Our forests in our territories are being threatened now.\u201d </p><p>Christianson points to a report that came from the United Nations in February, which she also co-authored. </p><p>Spreading like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires calls for governments to shift their spending from fighting fires to preventing fires. The \u201cfire-ready formula\u201d outlines a proactive approach instead of a reactive approach, with two-thirds of funding devoted to planning, preventing, preparedness and recovery, and only one-third to fighting fires. </p><p>The report also says that by the end of the century, the number of wildfires will have risen by 50 per cent. </p><p>\u201cThe science shows that we need more good fire on the ground. So it's time we actually start looking at addressing these things to move barriers out of the way. In the paper that's what the calls to action are really all about, trying to start moving some of these barriers so that communities are able to burn in the ways that they want,\u201d said Christianson. </p><p>Windspeaker.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-90af8e9fbb3e4c9a89999714bf8e6c4a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65B4-BCR1-DY9S-T307-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><timeReceived>06:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 27, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000013</classCode><className>ACCREDITATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

These fires are of criminal origin,' said Beldjoud, who headed a ministerial visit to Tizi Ouzou. <br/> The urban centres of Bouira, Setif, Khenchela, Guelma, Bejaia, Bordj Bou Arreridj, Boumerdes, Tiaret, Medea, Tebessa, Blida and Skikda were also hit by fires, the civil protection directorate said on Twitter. <br/> Major fires were also reported in Ait-Yenni, Azazga, Jijel and Yakourene. <br/><br/>- Arson suspected - <br/><br/>Public radio reported the arrest of three suspected arsonists in Medea. <br/> Arson has been blamed for several major fires in recent years. <br/> Last month, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune ordered a bill to stiffen punishments for starting a forest fire, with sentences of up to 30 years in prison \u2014 and possible life imprisonment, if the fire results in death. <br/> In July, three people were arrested on suspicion of starting fires that devastated 15 square kilometres (six square miles) of forest in the Aures mountains. <br/> In 2020, nearly 440 square kilometres (170 square miles) of forest were destroyed by fire, and several people were arrested on suspicion of arson. <br/> On Monday, the UN released a major report showing how the threat from global warming is even more acute than previously thought. <br/> It highlighted how scientists are quantifying the extent to which human-induced warming increases the intensity and/or likelihood of a specific extreme weather event, such as a heatwave or a wildfire. <br/><url

nitf:lede=\"true\">Oct 06, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/>Turkey's parliament on Wednesday unanimously ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, more than five years after Ankara first signed the landmark deal on cutting emissions that contribute to global warming. </p><p><br/> The vote followed President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's announcement at the UN General Assembly in September that Turkey would implement the accord in time for next month's UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. <br/>Turkey has felt the full force of climate change, with a rapid succession of floods and wildfires killing some 100 people in July and August. <br/> Swathes of the country have also been suffering through an extended drought. <br/> The crises have heaped political pressure on Erdogan to tackle greenhouse emissions blamed for global warming, which scientists say is contributing to increasingly extreme and more frequent adverse weather events. <br/> Nearly 200,000 hectares (around 480,000 acres) of forest have been scorched in Turkey this year \u2014 more than five times the annual average for 2008-2020, data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) show. <br/> Before Turkey's ratification, the Climate Action Tracker project said Ankara's efforts to reach the Paris accord's goals were 'critically insufficient'. <br/> Climate change has become one of the greatest issues of concern to Turkey's youth, millions of whom are set to vote for the first time in elections expected in 2023. <br/> Some 95 percent of young people in Turkey believe climate change is one of the biggest threats facing the country, according to a report last month by the British Council as part of its Global Youth Letter on Climate Action. <br/>Turkey's reticence to ratify the accord came over disputes about the amount of funding afforded to specific countries and timelines for putting stricter regulations into place. <br/>Turkey's total greenhouse gas emissions rose by 157.7 percent between 1990 and 2019, according to the state statistics service. <br/> One Western diplomat said Turkey had invested strongly in the infrastructure for renewable energy, including solar and wind, but remained weighed down by its reliance on polluting coal. <br/> 'Turkey's policy on the environment is reactionary, as we saw with the mucilage and the debate around importing European plastic waste,' the Western diplomat said. <br/> The shores of Istanbul were covered this summer by a viscous mucilage, also known as 'sea snot', which scientists blamed on an accumulation of pollutants being dumped into the Sea of Marmara. <br/> The government this year banned the import of some plastic waste products from countries including France and Britain, after a public backlash over images showing the waste dumped in ditches or burned by roadsides. <br/><url

What the hell \u2014 and I would probably use a different four-letter word \u2014 what the hell are they doing?\u201d Last September, Cloverdale Traditional Elementary School was announced as the winner of an Airpura contest, which saw the school receive the greatest number of votes from the community. According to a release, there were more than 1,725 schools nominated from both Canada and the U.S. Airpura\u2019s UV air purifiers range in price from $900 to $1,150.</p><p>There were 10 runner-up schools that received one HEPA air purifier each, with George Greenaway Elementary in Surrey also being selected based on the number of votes.</p><p>The Surrey school district confirmed that all the air purifiers were shipped to Cloverdale Traditional and are being stored there.</p><p>Those air purifiers remain stored at the school, according to the Cloverdale Traditional School\u2019s PAC.</p><p>\u201cParents are very frustrated that the 20 air purifiers are still in storage, and just waiting to be plugged in. Our hands are tied because of the Surrey school district\u2019s decision to not allow them for use,\u201d reads an emailed statement from the PAC.</p><p>\u201cWe feel the district is making a blanket policy district-wide, and not on a case by case basis. We really just want better indoor air quality for our children.\u201d</p><p>The district did not respond to a request for comment by publication time on whether or not it would consider changing its stance.</p><p>Last fall, the Surrey school district released an online ventilation database that lists what ventilation systems are used in different areas of each school site.</p><p>The district said that where the equipment can accommodate, it had upgraded filters in HVAC equipment to MERV-13s. However, in cases where the manufacturer specifications do not accommodate MERV-13s, the district has installed the next highest filters that can be accommodated \u2013 either MERV-11s or MERV-8s.</p><p>MERV stands for minimum efficiency reporting values. According to the Government of Canada\u2019s guidance on indoor ventilation during the pandemic, filters with higher MERV ratings \u201care more efficient at removing particles.\u201d</p><p>The school\u2019s PAC says the air purifiers are \u201cthe added layer of protection for the children,\u201d especially as masks are no longer mandatory in schools.</p><p>\u201cThis is not just for filtering out COVID-19, but also other viruses/bacteria, allergens, and smoke during forest fire season. The school building itself is 100 years old and all classrooms are using MERV-11 filtration system, so any additional filtration would assist in cleaning the air.\u201d</p><p>Air Pura\u2019s president and CEO Helder Pedro agrees with the Cloverdale Traditional School\u2019s PAC.</p><p>\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not just a one-off investment. If you improve the air quality across the 75,000 students in the district, generally speaking, you\u2019re not just improving the protection against COVID, you\u2019re also improving the long-term aspects.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s part of the reason why Pedro says he\u2019s working with the PAC to hopefully reverse the district and the school\u2019s decision to not use the donated HEPA filters.</p><p>Pedro emailed the PAC last week directing them to use two arguments when trying to encourage the use of the air purifiers.</p><p>The first, he said, is to \u201cattack the science that is being used to justify the inaction and the refusal of using the product.\u201d While the other looks at \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for people with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>School district spokesperson Ritinder Matthew previously said the district\u2019s health and safety team \u201cassessed the use of these units at the school and determined that they are not indicated for use at that specific site.\u201d</p><p>Matthew added the district reviews all requests for HEPA filters \u201ccarefully\u201d and considers all of the controls in place within the space, including ventilation, how the space is utilized and time spent in proximity to others.</p><p>\u201cThe physical layout of the space is also an important consideration as these units must be sized, placed correctly and maintained according to manufacturer\u2019s directions. An incorrectly placed unit may increase transmission risk due to the air currents it creates.\u201d</p><p>The district says that in \u201cmost spaces\u201d portable HEPA air filtration is \u201cnot indicated because we have layers of controls in place to prevent transmission. These include optimized ventilation, maximizing use of available space, wearing masks, limiting mixing of people, and limiting time spent in close proximity to others.\u201d</p><p>But Pedro described the district\u2019s reasoning as \u201casinine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need to be challenged.\u201d For now, Pedro said he\u2019s working with the PAC to hopefully reverse the decision.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLOREP-news20220324PPVA0002540636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLOREP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:652R-8BT1-F0HF-83XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Not a word about this, not even condolences.</p><p>The next pandemic is dry and hot and politicians will have to do more than to \"Try a new brew.\"</p><p>Granted, you and the Conservative Party are in the opposition with limited political power. Yet, instead of demanding even more subsidies for oil and gas (\"Remove the carbon tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas used by Canadian farmers\"), you could hold the Liberals accountable for wasting some $4.8 billion a year in subsidies for oil and gas.</p><p>We are on the brink of catastrophe from climate breakdown, as even conservative politicians such as the UK's Tory climate chief Alok Sharma have warned.</p><p>You will appreciate this assessment by taking a trip and talking to the communities in the Interior affected by wildfire, drought or both.</p><p>We have not had any substantial rain in the past two months.

Inspired by LlamaZOO's TimberOps software, Guardian was adapted and innovated through collaborations with First Nations across British Columbia to create a product that best serves their communities and priorities. The Guardian software, currently in use by 15 Nations with additional partners in discussion, is a powerful stewardship tool that will manage the cultural, ecological, and industrial data that impact each territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"After a year of collaboration and working closely with First Nations, Guardian is an innovative tool which enables Indigenous Land Managers, Elders, and community members across the province to manage multiple aspects of their operations and communities,\" said Charles Lavigne, LlamaZOO CEO and Co-Founder. \"From knowledge sharing between elders and younger generations, to the repatriation of historically significant artifacts, and improved connectivity to remote regions, we're confident that Guardian will help protect and enable many Nations throughout Canada.\"</p><p>Guardian takes large amounts of complex landscape-level data, previously pulled from Google Earth, satellite imaging and physical mapping, and turns it into an intuitive, 3D digital twin that First Nation community leaders can use to preserve and manage their land. The data can then be leveraged in numerous ways, including:</p><p> Cultural Data Preservation - accurately map the location of sacred sites, culturally modified trees, and other important areas so that knowledge is not lost over generations.Forest Fire Prevention - as forest fires burn faster and cover more ground than ever as a result of climate change, Guardian facilitates the mapping of underbrush (which causes wildfires to spread), the data is then shared within the Guardian app to assess the wildfire risk in that environment and helps identify high risk areas for prevention treatment.Connectivity Mapping to Remote Areas - Guardian supports conversations with telecommunications companies so that the internet and other connectivity tools can be brought to very remote, rural communities with less impact on culturally or environmentally sensitive areas.Education Across Generations - create 3D virtual reality experiences to bring ancestral knowledge to life through digital storytelling to educate and deepen the appreciation of traditional knowledge within the community.Land Planning Initiatives - drives conversations with the Chief and Council by helping them understand potential specific impacts to the land as well as cumulative effects, align stakeholders, and make informed decisions regarding mining, pipeline planning, forestry, and road planning. This enables the expansion of economic activity and jobs as Nations can take comfort knowing that sensitive sites and lands have been protected.Digitally Repatriate Artifacts - digitally repatriate artifacts by mapping and incorporating, with 3D scanning, the artifact to where it was found so that groups can take ownership of them. It also enables Elders to attach stories, embed media, and other content to each item and site.Carbon Credit Mapping - mapping of the environment including landscape, biome complexity, composition and carbon density, as well as geology, all of which can provide a better understanding of the carbon offset potential of the land. When environmental management strategies and activities are included, a more comprehensive projection of the long-term effects and impacts of potential carbon offset can be developed.</p><p>\"The Guardian software has enabled us to map our land and to visualize our resources in a proactive way that supports our conversations and negotiations with industry and government,\" said Robin Billy, Director of Operations, Stk'eml\u00fapsemc te Secwepemc First Nation. \"Preserving our culture, land, water sources and ancestral knowledge is very special to us, this technology supports that preservation while facilitating meaningful conversation.

Not a day goes by without news that shakes us to the bones and thank goodness that once in a while something nice happens, such as the hiker found on Mt. Garibaldi. I'm sure there are more very nice things happening, but the bad ones are often stuck in my mind.</p><p>No sooner did I figure out the COVID directives from the Ministry of Health, then a heat wave hit us and sadly some people couldn't cope with it. Then there was this huge forest fire in Lytton and unexpected floods in many countries across the world. Other natural disasters followed, but were trumped by the news of two successful launchings of aerospace vehicles.</p><p>Amid all this, Canada got a rude awakening, when hundreds unmarked graves of Indigenous children were discovered on previous residential school grounds. Most of us were stunned by the news and speculations were flying around as to what caused these children to pass away and why the graves were unmarked.</p><p>I came across a letter in the Times Colonist written by somebody who went to a residential school. The gentleman surmised that some of the children succumbed due to the change in diet, childhood illnesses introduced by the Europeans, homesickness and not being able to adjust to the many changes in their young lives. He also suggested that the graves at one time were marked with wooden crosses that deteriorated over the years. One can find this happening at most graveyards where headstones are not commonly used</p><p>I'm sure it must have been heartbreaking for the parents and extended families of these children to find out that they were not coming home. Heartbreaking in the first place that these children were taken from their environment and placed far away from anybody and anything they knew; having to get used to a different lifestyle, food, religion, speech and rules.</p><p>The government of those days may have thought to do good by the Indigenous people and the churches too may have felt that they did God's work by \"saving\" these folks, but not once were the Indigenous people given a choice. I'm not sure that we can hold our current government responsible for these horrendous practices. I can only hope they will learn from these mistakes as they enter into meetings with the chiefs. As for the churches, it's time for them to stop protecting those who abused their positions of trust and care. We can't punish those from decades ago, but we can demand that the heads of churches no longer protect the abusers.</p><p>I'll wait for the forensic reports, so I know who these children were and what really happened to them. I will never condone the vandalism done to statues and buildings. I can understand the anger and disgust some people feel, but it is not very conducive to a better relationship if one retaliates. Instead, let's listen to each other and talk to find ways to support each other with meaningful and long lasting solutions rather than the \"band aides\" often given so far. Let's demand accountability from all parties involved in these meetings.</p><p>Let's do this in memory of all the people, regardless of origin, religion, age, gender or station in life, that have fallen between the cracks.</p><p>Judy van der Boom</p><p>Mill Bay</p><p>Copyright 2021 Cowichan Valley Citizen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20210805ICZ4195170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639G-0NY1-JD2C-J2VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.
