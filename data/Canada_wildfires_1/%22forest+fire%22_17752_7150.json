Insured losses are estimated at about $4 billion.</p><p>The report says few homes caught fire due to direct contact with the flames or heat from the burning forest.</p><p>\"No, this fire was not, at least initially, an insurmountable force that rolled into, and over, an entire community like a smashing tidal wave,\" said Westhaver.</p><p>\"Primarily, it was millions of raisin-sized firebrands searching for places to carry on with combustion, and succeeding all too often.\"</p><p>Homes on the edges of neighbourhoods with yards that had less combustible material, including landscaping that kept trees and bushes further away, suffered less damage.</p><p>The report suggests that plans to protect communities from wildfires should include preventative action by homeowners.</p><p>Westhaver, a former Parks Canada wildfire manager, said building fireguards and clearing trees and bushes outside of communities isn't enough.</p><p>More attention must be paid to raising awareness among homeowners and governments about landscaping and building practices that will reduce the risk.</p><p>\"This progression can only be broken, and disaster avoided, by substantially increasing the proportion of homes that are resistant to ignition - especially by embers,\" Westhaver said.</p><p>\"The ignitability of homes and properties is really the weak point.\"</p><p>Other researchers are using computer technology to study the disaster to better understand how wildfires - and embers - behave.</p><p>Canadian Forest Service scientists are feeding data about the fire into a computer model known as FIRETEC.</p><p>The program allows scientists to set virtual wildfires to study how flames grow and move.

They determined that volatile phenols-chemicals in the smoke that can give wine an off-putting smoky flavour and aroma known as smoke taint-are absorbed quickly and remain in the grape long after the smoke has cleared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The biology of how wine grapes respond to smoke exposure is poorly understood,\" said Wesley Zandberg, assistant professor of chemistry at UBC's Okanagan campus, in a press release.</p><p>READ ALSO: WINE BOOTCAMP</p><p>\"Winemakers know that grapes grown in smoky conditions can lead to smoky-flavoured wine although the grapes themselves taste normal, and how or why this happens has largely remained a mystery.\"</p><p>To better understand the process, Zandberg worked with PhD student Matthew Noestheden and research associate Eric Dennis to collect samples of Cabernet Franc grapes after exposing them to simulated forest fire smoke. They then tested for the presence of volatile phenols at several time points after smoke exposure and in wine made from the same grapes.</p><p>\"We found that once the grapes were exposed to smoke, the volatile phenols were rapidly metabolized by the grape and stored, in part, in a sugary form that we can't taste or smell,\" said Noestheden. \"Once there, the concentrations remained unchanged in the grape throughout its development. Only when the grapes were fermented into wine could the smoky-flavoured volatile phenols be detected.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: MILLENNIALS CLOSING IN AS B.C.'s BIGGEST WINE DRINKERS</p><p>To ensure the experiments mimicked the real world as closely as possible, Zandberg, Dennis and Noestheden were careful to expose the grapes to smoke from locally sourced fuels, including Ponderosa pine and leaf litter from local forests.</p><p>\"The composition of smoke can vary wildly depending on regional vegetation,\" said Noestheden. \"For example, Australian wildfires predominantly burn species of eucalyptus and wild grasses, which is very different from what we'd see in western North America. To benefit the local wine industry, we wanted to make sure we measured how grapes were reacting to 'local smoke'.\"</p><p>In addition to measuring volatile phenols in grapes over time, the team also tested whether overhead irrigation, a potential strategy to mitigate the effect of smoke exposure on grapes, was effective in reducing their presence.</p><p>\"We washed the berries to simulate the use of an overhead irrigation system and we were surprised to learn that it didn't seem to affect the concentration of volatile phenols at all,\" said Zandberg. \"The good news is that our study provides all the procedures and protocols necessary to test new mitigation strategies in the future. We intend to pursue these with our industrial partner, Supra Research and Development.\"</p><p>Zandberg also said that they discovered something they weren't expecting.</p><p>While the amount of free volatile phenols that can be detected by taste and/or smell increased in the wine when compared to the grapes, so too did the sugary forms, which are not detectable by taste or smell.</p><p>\"We expected to see the sugary forms of the volatile phenols decreasing in the wine as the free versions increase, the latter being directly produced by the former, but instead we saw them both increassaid Zandberg. \"That means something else is going on and the story may be more complicated than we think.\"</p><p>SIGNATURE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-3518100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH4-6731-F105-64D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Country Calendar (Winfield)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008Z00</classCode><className>CHEMISTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000975</classCode><className>IRRIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N111332MM</classCode><className>GRAPE VINEYARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000068</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001843</classCode><className>WINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N312130MM</classCode><className>WINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000067</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000975</classCode><className>IRRIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The next showed the same tree as it would look five years later, branches stretching high above the bridge to form a canopy, giving Amazonians the feeling of walking through a rainforest. Bezos didn't want to wait for the little tree to grow.</p><p>\"The question I got back was, 'Well, can we have year five on day one,' \" says Ron Gagliardo, the project's lead horticulturalist. \"And that's kind of been our motto ever since.\"</p><p>The online retailer is scheduled to unveil the spheres Monday morning following seven years of planning and construction. The glass orbs were built to let Amazon workers escape from emails, meetings, reports and deadlines to walk along stone paths beside waterfalls, let ferns from South America brush their shoulders and the moist, tropical air fill their lungs.</p><p>\"It's Always Day One\" has been Bezos' mantra ever since he founded his company 24 years ago, and that startup ethos has remained intact even as Amazon swelled to more than 540,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue of almost $180 billion. \"Day One\" is so integral to Amazon culture that it is the name of the new Seattle tower where Bezos spends most of his working hours.</p><p>But when you're building a conservatory with 40,000 plants from around the world, Day One would resemble a barren wasteland recovering from a forest fire. So the team of plant specialists, architects and construction workers had to put their own twist on the boss's catchphrase to create a mature, living environment: \"Day One is Year Five.\"</p><p>The trickiest part of the project was transporting a 17-metre-tall tree nicknamed Rubi (short for Ficus rubiginosa) from a southern California farm to downtown Seattle, where it was hoisted by crane last summer and dropped through a hole in the roof. Finding and cultivating plants from around the world while simultaneously building their new home wasn't easy. The project created 600 full-time jobs from design through construction.</p><p>\"Accomplishing year five on day one presented a really big challenge for us,\" says M. David Sadinsky, an architect with the firm NBBJ that designed the spheres. \"We realized we had to finish the sphere, take part of it back apart, drop the tree in and then put it back together again.\"</p><p>From the outside, the three connected spheres resemble a glass-and-steel sculpture of a triple-scoop sundae. The biggest sphere is 27 metres high and 40 metres wide. Inside, visitors first notice the warm, moist air, about 22 C and 60-per-cent humidity.

They determined that volatile phenols-chemicals in the smoke that can give wine an off-putting smoky flavour and aroma known as smoke taint-are absorbed quickly and remain in the grape long after the smoke has cleared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The biology of how wine grapes respond to smoke exposure is poorly understood,\" said Wesley Zandberg, assistant professor of chemistry at UBC's Okanagan campus, in a press release.</p><p>READ ALSO: WINE BOOTCAMP</p><p>\"Winemakers know that grapes grown in smoky conditions can lead to smoky-flavoured wine although the grapes themselves taste normal, and how or why this happens has largely remained a mystery.\"</p><p>To better understand the process, Zandberg worked with PhD student Matthew Noestheden and research associate Eric Dennis to collect samples of Cabernet Franc grapes after exposing them to simulated forest fire smoke. They then tested for the presence of volatile phenols at several time points after smoke exposure and in wine made from the same grapes.</p><p>\"We found that once the grapes were exposed to smoke, the volatile phenols were rapidly metabolized by the grape and stored, in part, in a sugary form that we can't taste or smell,\" said Noestheden. \"Once there, the concentrations remained unchanged in the grape throughout its development. Only when the grapes were fermented into wine could the smoky-flavoured volatile phenols be detected.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: MILLENNIALS CLOSING IN AS B.C.'s BIGGEST WINE DRINKERS</p><p>To ensure the experiments mimicked the real world as closely as possible, Zandberg, Dennis and Noestheden were careful to expose the grapes to smoke from locally sourced fuels, including Ponderosa pine and leaf litter from local forests.</p><p>\"The composition of smoke can vary wildly depending on regional vegetation,\" said Noestheden. \"For example, Australian wildfires predominantly burn species of eucalyptus and wild grasses, which is very different from what we'd see in western North America. To benefit the local wine industry, we wanted to make sure we measured how grapes were reacting to 'local smoke'.\"</p><p>In addition to measuring volatile phenols in grapes over time, the team also tested whether overhead irrigation, a potential strategy to mitigate the effect of smoke exposure on grapes, was effective in reducing their presence.</p><p>\"We washed the berries to simulate the use of an overhead irrigation system and we were surprised to learn that it didn't seem to affect the concentration of volatile phenols at all,\" said Zandberg. \"The good news is that our study provides all the procedures and protocols necessary to test new mitigation strategies in the future. We intend to pursue these with our industrial partner, Supra Research and Development.\"</p><p>Zandberg also said that they discovered something they weren't expecting.</p><p>While the amount of free volatile phenols that can be detected by taste and/or smell increased in the wine when compared to the grapes, so too did the sugary forms, which are not detectable by taste or smell.</p><p>\"We expected to see the sugary forms of the volatile phenols decreasing in the wine as the free versions increase, the latter being directly produced by the former, but instead we saw them both increassaid Zandberg. \"That means something else is going on and the story may be more complicated than we think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRAILD-3518180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRAILD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH4-6731-F105-64FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trail Daily Times</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008Z00</classCode><className>CHEMISTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000975</classCode><className>IRRIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N111332MM</classCode><className>GRAPE VINEYARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000068</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001843</classCode><className>WINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N312130MM</classCode><className>WINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000067</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000975</classCode><className>IRRIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But because the crew was working on top of muskeg _ a swamp of water and vegetation _ the weight of the bulldozer was absorbed and the woman simply sank into the earth.</p><p>''Thank heavens for muskeg,'' said Linda Parks, spokeswoman for Alberta Occupational Health and Safety, which is investigating the incident. ''But there were a couple of horrified people out there.''</p><p>When the bulldozer drivers realized what had happened, they stopped their machines and found the firefighter trapped underneath the back of one of the bulldozers.</p><p>She suffered a badly broken arm and a damaged ear.</p><p>Because firefighting helicopters were already nearby, Parks said the woman was quickly airlifted to hospital in Fort McMurray. She was later transferred to the University of Alberta Hospital.</p><p>The massive forest fire was still burning out of control Monday, but officials said it poses no risk to the Suncor plant or the neighbouring Petro-Canada oilsands lease.</p><p>More than 60 firefighters were battling the blaze.

(CP) - A 40-year-old firefighter has been missing since early Monday morning at the site of a forest fire near this remote northeastern Saskatchewan community. John Roderick Ross of La Ronge, Sask., walked out of the firefighters' camp at 3 a.m., said John Cook of the Saskatchewan forest fire centre in Prince Albert. Ross had signed on as a firefighter Saturday. \"Nobody really knows why he left,'' Cook said Tuesday. \"If a person really wants to go for his own reasons, you can't stop them.'' Firefighters launched a ground search at first light and helicopter crews spent seven hours in the air looking for Ross. A 14-member RCMP search and rescue team, aided by a Prince Albert RCMP police dog and handler, arrived Monday night and spent Tuesday searching the area by ground. Cook said Ross, who is four-foot-10 and weighs about 150 pounds, \"should be able to handle himself'' as he has 20 years experience in the bush as a trapper. \"Ross wouldn't appear to be in a lot of danger from the fires themselves,'' said Cook, who said two of three forest fires in the area were being held - including the one where Ross was working. \"We've had a good rainfall, and there wouldn't be a whole lot of smoke in the area.'' Nevertheless, protocol in a fire zone requires that all personnel be accounted for, he said.</p><p>\"The fire may be held now, but if it gets hot and dry those fires can move quickly. It's best to err on the side of caution.'' Ross said 560 firefighters were employed by the Department of Environment and Resource Management on Tuesday. About 170 residents of Southend - mostly older people and children - were forced from their homes by heavy forest fire smoke last week. They were allowed to return over the weekend. Southend, which has a population of about 660, is 375 kilometres northeast of Prince Albert.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199306290322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1993</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4713-YJX0-01G6-83T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"320\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1993 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"1993\"><dateText>June 29, 1993 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Military &amp; Veterans Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Searches Not Requiring Probable Cause</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI3NEZDMzQzNzQ1NDA0RDlGNkM3MUE1NTQxRjJGRkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I5NDA0N0Q5ODg1NEE1NTg1OUYyNTNGNDgzOEQxQzk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001151</classCode><className>MISSING PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DSK2</classCode><className>WORKING ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Growing up in an area so steeped in natural beauty, but also constantly under threat from climate change and human activity, gave Edenshaw perspective from a young age on the importance of protecting the land.</p><p>\"I've always grown up with the reality of climate change and protesting ecological destruction. Joining my family and the Haida nation as stewards and protectors of our traditional land from logging, trophy hunting, those kind of things,\" Edenshaw said. \"I've always been really environmentally aware, and tried to make all the changes I could individually in my own consumer habits.\"</p><p>Youth climate activist Haana Edenshaw of Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, walks to a rally in downtown Vancouver on Friday. Edenshaw is one of 15 plaintiffs who launched a lawsuit against the Canadian government. (Robin Loznak photo)</p><p>At home in Masset, Edenshaw started an ecological club to work on issues of climate activism and environmental protection. She also organized a climate strike day earlier in the year. Recently, she took her voice to the international stage when she was chosen to be a speaker at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, making recommendations to the assembled group of rapporteurs that nations should adhere to.</p><p>\"It was really interesting to get to know so many people involved in this kind of thing,\" Edenshaw said of her international experience. \"There's so many amazing people working on the policy, and it was great to be able to get my voice heard.\"</p><p>Naturally, when Edenshaw heard that a lawsuit was mounting against the Canadian government on the issue of climate change, she knew she had to be a part of it.</p><p>\"When I heard about the lawsuit I was immediately interested and looking forward to try and work with it,\" Edenshaw explained. \"</p><p>READ MORE: Forest fire inspires Smithers youth to join climate lawsuit</p><p>The youth will claim the government's actions violate section 15, which deals with equality, as they say young people are disproportionately affected by climate change.</p><p>They will be represented by Arvay Finlay LLP and Tollefson Law Corporation, and partner with the Pacific Centre for Environmental Law and Litigation and the David Suzuki Foundation.</p><p>\"The lawsuit calls on Canada to cease its conduct that is violating the youth's Charter and public trust rights and prepare and implement a plan that reduces Canada's GHG emissions in a manner consistent with what best available science indicates is needed for the federal government to protect young Canadians, do its fair share to stabilize the climate system, and avert the catastrophic consequences of climate change,\" the foundation said in a statement.</p><p>Haana Edenshaw has been involved with environmental activism her whole life, and was determined to help when she heard about the lawsuit. (Robin Loznak photo)</p><p>Edenshaw makes clear that there is no financial gain being pursued via this legal action. \"The purpose of the lawsuit is not to get money or anything for ourselves. If the lawsuit succeeds the court will order the federal government to develop and implement a science based climate recovery plan, based on the best available science made to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, and increase carbon sequestration with what scientists say is needed to stabilize the climate system,\" she said.</p><p>On Friday the youth took part in a march and rally at the northern steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery Friday, coinciding with Greta Thunberg's arrival and climate strike in the city. All 15 plaintiffs were present at the rally, where they were able to make their case heard.</p><p>\"The rally was incredible. It was amazing to be able to have my voice heard, and it was amazing to meet Great Thunberg. She's such an inspirational climate activist, and such a powerful speaker, it was really an honour to be up on that stage with her,\" Edenshaw said of the event.</p><p>The climate activists were joined on stage by David Suzuki and Severn Cullis-Suzuki, who herself delivered an impassioned speech as a youth to the Rio Summit on climate change in 1992 when she was 12. Edenshaw explained that not only did the rally bring awareness to their cause, but also reinforced her spirit to see all of the support. Approximately 15,000 people came out to witness the rally.</p><p>(Robin Loznak photo)</p><p>\"It was really inspiring to know that there are people out there who are working really hard too. It made me feel a lot better,\" Edenshaw explained.</p><p>\"Seeing 15,000 people there supporting us, and seeing all these incredible people working so hard to do their part to avert the climate crisis has really made me feel a lot better about our case. It was amazing to meet my 14 co-plaintiffs, who are really inspirational people and who are working so hard all over Canada to help the environment. I feel like the government of Canada will see all our support.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Premier's Award for Haida athlete</p><p>Edenshaw and the other activists know it will be a long road ahead in court, but says they are ready for the challenge. She is occasionally discouraged by those who insist climate change is not real, but says there is enough support to drown out the negativity.</p><p>\"That would affect anyone, seeing that kind of backlash,\" Edenshaw says of some of the comments that surround the issue. \"But knowing we have such strong support, and there's also a community of co-plaintiffs who are also going through this sort of thing, it's really good to have that support network. I can't understand the disbelief, but we just try and tune it out.\"</p><p>\"I have to do everything I can to prevent this and get Canada to act, because the government has a responsibility to make sure that this country is safe for everyone living in it,\" Edenshaw concluded.</p><p>Alex Kurial | Journalist</p><p>Alex Kurial</p><p>Send Alex emailLike the Haida Gwaii Observer on Facebook</p><p>Follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAIDAG-3894759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAIDAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD3-HJB1-F103-3300-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438226</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Haida Gwaii Observer</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Business &amp;

Growing up in an area so steeped in natural beauty, but also constantly under threat from climate change and human activity, gave Edenshaw perspective from a young age on the importance of protecting the land.</p><p>\"I've always grown up with the reality of climate change and protesting ecological destruction. Joining my family and the Haida nation as stewards and protectors of our traditional land from logging, trophy hunting, those kind of things,\" Edenshaw said. \"I've always been really environmentally aware, and tried to make all the changes I could individually in my own consumer habits.\"</p><p>Youth climate activist Haana Edenshaw of Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, walks to a rally in downtown Vancouver on Friday. Edenshaw is one of 15 plaintiffs who launched a lawsuit against the Canadian government. (Robin Loznak photo)</p><p>At home in Masset, Edenshaw started an ecological club to work on issues of climate activism and environmental protection. She also organized a climate strike day earlier in the year. Recently, she took her voice to the international stage when she was chosen to be a speaker at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, making recommendations to the assembled group of rapporteurs that nations should adhere to.</p><p>\"It was really interesting to get to know so many people involved in this kind of thing,\" Edenshaw said of her international experience. \"There's so many amazing people working on the policy, and it was great to be able to get my voice heard.\"</p><p>Naturally, when Edenshaw heard that a lawsuit was mounting against the Canadian government on the issue of climate change, she knew she had to be a part of it.</p><p>\"When I heard about the lawsuit I was immediately interested and looking forward to try and work with it,\" Edenshaw explained. \"</p><p>READ MORE: Forest fire inspires Smithers youth to join climate lawsuit</p><p>The youth will claim the government's actions violate section 15, which deals with equality, as they say young people are disproportionately affected by climate change.</p><p>They will be represented by Arvay Finlay LLP and Tollefson Law Corporation, and partner with the Pacific Centre for Environmental Law and Litigation and the David Suzuki Foundation.</p><p>\"The lawsuit calls on Canada to cease its conduct that is violating the youth's Charter and public trust rights and prepare and implement a plan that reduces Canada's GHG emissions in a manner consistent with what best available science indicates is needed for the federal government to protect young Canadians, do its fair share to stabilize the climate system, and avert the catastrophic consequences of climate change,\" the foundation said in a statement.</p><p>Haana Edenshaw has been involved with environmental activism her whole life, and was determined to help when she heard about the lawsuit. (Robin Loznak photo)</p><p>Edenshaw makes clear that there is no financial gain being pursued via this legal action. \"The purpose of the lawsuit is not to get money or anything for ourselves. If the lawsuit succeeds the court will order the federal government to develop and implement a science based climate recovery plan, based on the best available science made to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, and increase carbon sequestration with what scientists say is needed to stabilize the climate system,\" she said.</p><p>On Friday the youth took part in a march and rally at the northern steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery Friday, coinciding with Greta Thunberg's arrival and climate strike in the city. All 15 plaintiffs were present at the rally, where they were able to make their case heard.</p><p>\"The rally was incredible. It was amazing to be able to have my voice heard, and it was amazing to meet Great Thunberg. She's such an inspirational climate activist, and such a powerful speaker, it was really an honour to be up on that stage with her,\" Edenshaw said of the event.</p><p>The climate activists were joined on stage by David Suzuki and Severn Cullis-Suzuki, who herself delivered an impassioned speech as a youth to the Rio Summit on climate change in 1992 when she was 12. Edenshaw explained that not only did the rally bring awareness to their cause, but also reinforced her spirit to see all of the support. Approximately 15,000 people came out to witness the rally.</p><p>(Robin Loznak photo)</p><p>\"It was really inspiring to know that there are people out there who are working really hard too. It made me feel a lot better,\" Edenshaw explained.</p><p>\"Seeing 15,000 people there supporting us, and seeing all these incredible people working so hard to do their part to avert the climate crisis has really made me feel a lot better about our case. It was amazing to meet my 14 co-plaintiffs, who are really inspirational people and who are working so hard all over Canada to help the environment. I feel like the government of Canada will see all our support.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Premier's Award for Haida athlete</p><p>Edenshaw and the other activists know it will be a long road ahead in court, but says they are ready for the challenge. She is occasionally discouraged by those who insist climate change is not real, but says there is enough support to drown out the negativity.</p><p>\"That would affect anyone, seeing that kind of backlash,\" Edenshaw says of some of the comments that surround the issue. \"But knowing we have such strong support, and there's also a community of co-plaintiffs who are also going through this sort of thing, it's really good to have that support network. I can't understand the disbelief, but we just try and tune it out.\"</p><p>\"I have to do everything I can to prevent this and get Canada to act, because the government has a responsibility to make sure that this country is safe for everyone living in it,\" Edenshaw concluded.</p><p>Alex Kurial | Journalist</p><p>Alex Kurial</p><p>Send Alex emailLike the Haida Gwaii Observer on Facebook</p><p>Follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NORTHV-3894726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NORTHV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD3-HJB1-F103-32Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438217</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Northern View (Prince Rupert)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Business &amp;

Over the last 13 years, Raphael has conducted research into the science, history and environmental aspects of Okanagan Lake. This is what led to the creation of the Okanagan Lake book, the first and only book written about our precious freshwater resource. The 272-page novel provides a holistic view of all aspects of the lake in addition to a chapter on Raphael's own underwater research expeditions into the deepest regions of the lake. Much of the research that he has been involved in concerns itself with the biology, geology and the anthropogenic interactions with the lake. In 2008, when the B.C. Ministry of Transportation was mere days away from sinking the old Okanagan Lake Floating Bridge into the lake, Raphael was an instrumental voice in opposing this decision from using our lake as a landfill and the bridge contractor was forced to recycle the materials. This is a must read.

Sergei Donskoi, Russia's natural resources minister, recently warned that this year's fire season could be the worst ever.</p><p>\"Due to a shortage of precipitation, the forest fire season has begun almost one and a half months ahead of the norm,\" he said at a conference chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, according to the Siberian Times.</p><p>Seventeen forest fires have already been reported across 2,000 hectares.</p><p>Siberia is thousands of kilometres away, yet smog from Russian wildfires often lofts high enough into the atmosphere that it travels across the Pacific Ocean, blanketing the western coast of North America.</p><p>In 2012, when furious wildfires broke out early, smoke from Siberia caused record ground-level ozone in British Columbia. Smoke from Siberia can also deposit soot across the fragile Arctic ecosystem, scientists say. Darker ice reflects less solar radiation back into space. Ice that absorbs more radiation melts faster and, in turn, less ice in the Arctic can affect weather around the world.</p><p>Wildfires have also been hastening the thawing of vital permafrost.</p><p>The latest United Nations International Panel on Climate Change report predicted increasing \"permafrost degradation in Siberia\" as one of the globe's most worrisome trends.</p><p>Read more stories like this at:</p><p>thestar.com/news/the_world_daily</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Siberian smoke: a new export.

(CP) - The threat of wind-whipped fire blazing through this community hasn't materialized, but fire officials warned today the danger is not over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Until we get rain, the threat will be there,'' fire boss Roy Benson said today. \"Without rain, this fire will burn for two more months.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-BODY- The tinder-dry conditions and the threat of higher winds have made fire officials reluctant to tell 8,000 evacuated residents when they can return home.</p><p>\"The risk is still there,'' said Benson.</p><p>\"Nothing has changed as far as the fire goes. It's a very large fire. There's a large amount of burning material that could still come out of the fire.''</p><p>A feared cold front that was supposed to pack winds gusting to 85 kilometres an hour passed harmlessly over this half-evacuated southern B.C. city without pushing a nearby forest fire into town.</p><p>The front came later and proved weaker than forecast, forestalling a repeat of last Wednesday's conflagration that destroyed 16 homes and damaged 25 other buildings in Salmon Arm's rural outskirts.</p><p>B.C. Premier Glen Clark declared a state of emergency last Sunday.</p><p>While evacuees went to friends, relatives or emergency shelters in neighboring communities, a force of about 500 firefighters, backed by 100 soldiers, prepared to face the expected onslaught.</p><p>It never came.</p><p>The front moved through early Monday evening and the winds hardly rustled leaves.</p><p>Fire officials said the blaze was largely stable overnight.</p><p>The regional fire commissioner who recommended the initial state of emergency was meeting with other officials this morning to re-evaluate the evacuation and alert orders, said spokeswoman Anne Ferdinand.</p><p>\"We hope we'll have a decision later today with respect to the evacuation and alert situation,'' she said.</p><p>However, the abandoned neighborhoods may not be ready for residents to return because gas and water mains in some areas may have been shut off to aid firefighters in their defence of the city.</p><p>\"We're definitely not encouraging people who were evacuated to head home just now,'' Ferdinand said.</p><p>Crews using heavy machinery as well as shovels and axes have completed guards around the fire, removing potential fuel sources. They spent Monday dealing with flareups within the fire's perimeter, which expanded its area to 5,000 hectares.</p><p>A hectare is about the size of a football field.</p><p>Weather forecasters predict a high-pressure ridge will rebuild over the region for the next few days.</p><p>\"That will bring hot, dry weather and winds will be fairly light,'' said Mitzi Bushell, a B.C. Forest Service fire information officer.</p><p>\"We're cautiously optimistic at this point.''</p><p>Containing the fire within guards, however, is not the same as declaring it under control, Bushell stressed.</p><p>\"It'll be weeks before it is under control,'' she said. \"We definitely need some rain, some measureable amount of rain, before it can be considered under control.''</p><p>The evacuation made it easier for firefighters facing the blaze, knowing they would not have to contend with a crush of last-minute refugees if they had to fight the fire in town.</p><p>\"It's a relief for me,'' city fire chief Ken Tebo said.</p><p>If the rest of the city was forced to evacuate, \"to move them out in a very short time is just about impossible.''</p><p>Most residents in the affected area left between late Sunday and early Monday, leaving Salmon Arm a veritable ghost town.</p><p>Shops and restaurants were closed, leaving remaining tourists in the lakeside city with little to do.</p><p>But possibly hundreds of people chose to stay, at least until the danger was more imminent.</p><p>\"If it was up to me, I wouldn't leave,'' said Bob Kline as he checked under the hood of his pickup truck. \"The wife wants to leave. There is no wind right now, eh.''</p><p>Others planned to defy both the flames and police, who have the power to force them out if they impede firefighters.</p><p>Standing in the fire's way - an army of firefighters, backed by soldiers, a fleet of water-bombing helicopters and planes and dozens of pieces of heavy equipment, including 40 fire trucks from across British Columbia.</p><p>It was a baptism of fire for Charlie Company of the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Regiment, who after a day of training helped deal with flareups and mopped up hot spots.</p><p>Some of the soldiers had fought fires before in Alberta and New Brunswick, while others were learning, said unit commander Maj. David Anderson.</p><p>He said his men, used to dangerous missions, were relishing the fire fight, but he didn't underestimate this enemy.</p><p>\"Right now it's a series of small battles and I don't think there's been a major battle yet,'' said Anderson.</p><p>\"I definitely think we're winning the war and we haven't lost a small battle yet when it comes to the fire.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199808110073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4701-3B50-01G6-8011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 11, 1998 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>XIAMEN ANNE CORP LTD \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0XIAMEN ANNE CORP LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>002235 (SZSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS322121 PAPER (EXCEPT NEWSPRINT) MILLS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0SIC2621 PAPER MILLS \u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N624230MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Dixie has been perfecting the art and science of crafting quality infused-cannabis products for nearly a decade and at the heart of every award-winning product is a deep rooted passion for and belief in the power of the plant; that's why, timed to 4/20, Dixie is proud to announce a company-wide promise to be better stewards of the earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dixie will kick off \"GO GREEN\" by partnering with One Tree Planted, a nonprofit that works with reforestation organizations around the world to get trees in the ground in order to help with forest fire recovery, expanding wildlife habitats, improving watershed health, and providing a social impact to local communities. To support the organization's mission and to help offset its carbon footprint, Dixie will donate $1.001 from every Dixie Brands product purchased on 4/20. For every $1.00 Dixie donates, One Tree Planted will plant one tree in North America.</p><p>\"We recognize that we rely heavily on Mother Nature to create our award-winning products, and we have a responsibility to take care of her if we want future generations to continue to benefit from her resources,\" said Chuck Smith, CEO of Dixie Brands. \"4/20 is always a very exciting time for our category, and this year we're thrilled to launch our GO GREEN commitment in partnership with One Tree Planted to execute a tangible and immediate program that allows us to begin offsetting our carbon footprint right now, while inviting consumers to get involved right alongside us.\"</p><p>Beyond 4/20, 'going green' will remain a top priority for Dixie as the company vows to become Clean Green Certified for its facility by 2020 and helping partners to do the same. Dixie will also purposefully review and revise packaging to ensure at least Class One Recyclability for products and plans to phase out non \"green\" packaging manufactured in all Dixie facilities in the future2. Additionally, Dixie will implement a new company-funded employee volunteer program, providing employees with the opportunity to give back and support the environment with the brand's full support.</p><p>\"The cannabis industry as a whole is growing at a rapid pace, and as a pioneer in CPG cannabis, we believe the industry must do better to protect the environment,\" said Smith. \"It's time to shine a spotlight on this important industry-wide issue and lead by example in implementing sustainable business practices. We believe it's about looking forward, being responsible and conscientious as it relates to our environmental impact, and encouraging others to do the same.\"</p><p>Dixie expects to open six more facilities across the U.S. in 2019, including the newest operation in Michigan which was announced last month. As the business expands its footprint, both nationally and internationally, Dixie is also committing to updating and building eco-friendly facilities that include: //st * Transitioning all light fixtures to LED * Closing production facilities one day each week to conserve energy * Providing a $500 annual credit to employees that have electric cars</p><p>Since 2010, Dixie has been a trailblazer in the cannabis category, creating safe and delicious THC and CBD-infused products for its customers to enjoy.

Liberal forests critic Wilf Hurd said the Forests Ministry has sent six bureaucrats to Mexico to act as observers and trainers for a Mexican forest-fire fighting program. And transportation critic Doug Symons said it was \"repugnant'' to send a B.C. Transit board member to Venice, Italy, to deliver a 20-minute speech about ferry service last week. \"Instead of sending civil servants to Mexico to enjoy the sunshine and the tequila, the forests minister should let the private sector do it and give taxpayers a break,'' Hurd said. Forests Minister Dan Miller said his ministry has several contracts with foreign governments to provide training and advice on forest-fire suppression, but he said he didn't know the financial details of the Mexican trip. \"Our fire suppression branch here in British Columbia is unparalleled in the world,'' Miller said. \"We make money marketing those services that we've developed.'' Finance Minister Glen Clark, whose portfolio includes Crown-controlled B.C. Transit, said he had no problem with the Italian trip by board member Chris Clement. In addition to the speech and a slide presentation, Clement also accepted an award for transit excellence on behalf of the province. \"I think it's delightful that board members can go and accept an international prestigious award on behalf of the people of British Columbia,'' Clark said.</p><p>Clement said Tuesday that the organizers of the Venice conference where he spoke paid for his hotel bill while the Crown corporation paid his plane fare. Miller said he would check to see if taxpayers paid any part of the cost of the Mexican trip, but Hurd said the government should instead allow private sector companies to participate. Hurd said several private sector forest-fire fighting companies had bid on the Mexican contract and making room for them would have helped the province's economy. \"The private sector may have lost out because of the interference by the Ministry of Forests,'' Hurd said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199303240329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1993</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4713-22X0-01G6-812B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"360\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1993 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"1993\"><dateText>March 24, 1993 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That includes campfires.</p><p>The Town of Smithers open fire ban is also in effect, so burning inside and outside of town is prohibited.</p><p>The current wildfire risk in southern parts of the fire centre is \"high\" to \"extreme\" and the provincial wildfire situation remains serious. Fire crews from throughout the province, including Smithers, are deployed to fight wildfires in the Cariboo and other parts of southern B.C.</p><p>BC Wildfire said in a realease though sufficient firefighting resources remain in the Northwest Fire Centre to deal with current fire activity here, it is vital that BC Wildfire Service resources not be diverted to respond to unnecessary and preventable human-caused fires. Open fires present an unacceptable risk and detract from detection and response capabilities by increasing the number of \"false alarm\" smoke chases and nuisance fires.</p><p>Smithers Fire Rescue has responded to several fire calls during the current ban.</p><p>BC Wildfire said fire wardens are on patrol to educate people about the campfire ban and they are issuing violation tickets to people participating in prohibited activities. A ticket for \"lighting, fueling or use of fire against regulations\" carries a fine of $1,150 and applies to every person in the fire's vicinity.</p><p>Specifically, prohibited activities include:</p><p>* campfires</p><p>* the burning of waste, slash or other materials</p><p>* stubble or grass fires of any size over any area</p><p>* fires burning woody debris in outdoor stoves</p><p>* the use of fireworks, sky lanterns, tiki torches, chimineas, burning barrels or burning cages of any size or description</p><p>* the use of binary exploding targets (e.g. for target practice)</p><p>These prohibitions do not apply to cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes, or to a portable campfire apparatus with a CSA or ULC rating that uses briquettes, liquid or gaseous fuel so long as the height of the flame is less than 15 cm. The use of a campfire apparatus that does not meet these specifications is prohibited.</p><p>These prohibitions cover all BC Parks, Crown lands and private lands, but do not apply within the boundaries of a local government that has forest fire prevention bylaws and is serviced by a fire department. Most Northwest communities - including Smithers - have their own bans in effect.</p><p>Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.</p><p>To report a wildfire or open burning violation, call 1-800-663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.

All on-highway vehicles must also remain on defined road surfaces.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-3410751</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P61-3BG1-F105-62YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Smithers Interior News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 4, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp; PENALTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DM7G</classCode><className>EMERGENCY FALSE ALARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001988</classCode><className>NUISANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001930</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A4J6</classCode><className>CRIMINAL FINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DN66</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000A4JU</classCode><className>CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001550</classCode><className>SENTENCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A4J3</classCode><className>JAIL SENTENCING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DN62</classCode><className>FIREWORKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

If this is our future, it's a lot tougher game, isn't it?\"</p><p>The company which offers guided hut-to-hut backcountry hiking trips in the summer for small groups was shut down for three weeks in 2017 when the province closed Wells Gray Provincial Park due to fire danger.</p><p>This year, many of his guests called to cancel because of the smoke but Eakins, 63, said he was able to convince most that the air would be clear and the views magnificent once they got out of the valleys and onto mountain trails above the haze.</p><p>The 2018 fires burned more than 1.3 million hectares of forest, surpassing the total from the record set the previous year when the province was in a state of emergency for a much longer 10-week period.</p><p>Many tourism businesses have suffered losses from the back-to-back fire seasons but the damage to B.C.'s brand could be just as costly, said Jeremy Stone, an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia who has conducted research into economic and business resilience to disasters.</p><p>\"The brand damage, that's the much more difficult one ... You really start to become associated with, 'This is not a place I should be,'\" he said. He said a recent news story about a European tourist who was evacuated due to fire for the second year in a row this summer is an example of the hits B.C.'s reputation is taking.</p><p>The province is trying to mitigate and prevent wildfires but tourism operators should be dealing with what looks like a continuing risk by offering and promoting fall, spring and winter options rather than relying too heavily on the peak summer season, he said.</p><p>Hotel occupancy statistics will show Prince George, B.C., had a great summer but the numbers don't tell the whole story, said Annie Doran, marketing manager for the local tourism bureau.</p><p>\"Our accommodations have been full two summers in a row due to large numbers of evacuees coming to Prince George as the main evacuation centre,\" she said.</p><p>\"It was incredibly smoky. We basically had six weeks of no sunshine, just cloaked in with smoke,\" Doran said, adding the industry reported many cancellations or abbreviated trips.</p><p>Smoke that spilled over the border into Alberta caused more than 3,000 guests to cancel helicopter sightseeing tours from locations near Banff National Park and in the Badlands of southern Alberta, reported Todd Johnson, director of business development for Alpine Helicopters.</p><p>He said it was a bad summer all around, estimating a total of 10,000 guests cancelled, leading to a $1-million revenue shortfall.</p><p>\"We had a lot of cancellations due to weather and then, when the weather improved, of course, fire season kicked in and it was smoke, so we had to cancel or give guests the option of not going just because of the visibility,\" he said.</p><p>He said the fires are a \"black eye\" for the industry.</p><p>\"The whole point is to see the mountains, to be up close and personal to those big mountains.\"</p><p>The fires led to many cancellations throughout B.C. this year and statistics will likely show a substantial impact on tourism when they are released, said Walt Judas, CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of B.C.</p><p>He said there may be an impact on bookings next year but he doesn't expect a long-term reduction because demand for B.C.'s tourism product is growing in new markets such as China, Mexico and Australia and is steady in traditional markets such as the United States.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-09/30/201847996330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCN-PBV1-JDH1-C0P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Also, he has yet to throw an interception this season after four games, which is a school record.</p><p>\"Once we realized that we could run by them a little bit, on the outside there, we started to get some one-on-one opportunities, we took advantage of them and then it kind of opened things up,\" Rypien said.</p><p>Broncos coach Bryan Harsin credited Rypien's success to how he prepares before each game.</p><p>\"He's very focused, very intentional about what he does, and I think it shows up on the field,\" Harsin said. \"He's as consistent week to week as I've been around.\"</p><p>A.J Richardson caught six passes for 113 yards and one TD, a 21-yard score. John Hightower caught the other TD pass from Rypien.</p><p>As tiny specks of ash floated into War Memorial Stadium from a wildfire in the region, Wyoming (2-3, 0-1) could muster little offence against the Boise State defence. The Cowboys, who have lost 12 of 13 contests against the Broncos, managed just 12 total net yards in the first quarter and 73 for the half. Wyoming converted just two of 11 third-down attempts during the game and gave up five sacks.</p><p>Nico Evans led the Cowboys with 141 yards on 12 carries, including a 75-yard TD run on the first play of the third quarter.</p><p>\"If you go against a good team like Boise you can't start slow,\" Evans said. \"The one thing we told ourselves is if we wanted to win we had to start off fast, and we just didn't do that tonight.\"</p><p>Tyler Vander Waal completed 15 of 25 passes for 214 yards and one TD, but most of the success coming when the game was no longer in doubt.</p><p>THE TAKEAWAY</p><p>Boise State is hoping to re-establish itself in The AP college football poll with the road victory.

Clean air is nothing to sneeze at! Breathing fresh air isn't appreciated until you have been breathing smoky air for weeks on end. Having grown up in the Okanagan we have a real understanding of the forest fire situation, every year there was smoke in the Valley for at least a short while. Asthmatic people (like me) had a rough time of it.</p><p>If you have not yet made your donation to the Red Cross to beef up their relief funds, now is the time. They must be nearly empty with all the evacuations required this year.</p><p>A family outing to Pure Lake was enhanced by the discovery of 'Sun Dews' along the lake shore. The fascinating little bog plants are fly-catchers native to Haida Gwaii. Never have I seen such a massing of them, when you look closely they are everywhere! Bogs are amazing places to look closely anyway. Take the time and you will be rewarded with a genuinely peaceful afternoon of 'life study'.</p><p>Infinity's New Sort is beginning to happen. A dredging session needs to take place in the next while. It's always exciting to see some industry plans move forward, securing our community job situation. There should be less logging trucks moving down our main street when the new sort is completed. That will be a good thing.</p><p>The long weekend is adjusting our Council Meeting once again to Tuesday, Aug 8th,at 7 pm.</p><p>This month's Book Club meeting will be in the Seniors' room on Monday at 7 pm, even though it's a Holiday weekend. The book of choice is, \"The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\", by Gabriel Zevin. This group is open to all readers.</p><p>Posters for Edge of the World Music Festival seem to indicate that tickets need to be bought in advance this year. While I am sure this is a far better plan for the conveners I question how that will work out. Perhaps my perception is incorrect. A lot of people attend this event whimsically.</p><p>Our Doctor is here on Tues. 8th &amp; 15th, Wed. 16th &amp;23rd, and Thurs. 24th &amp;31st. We still have some Masset doctor days when she is on call there.</p><p>\"Agate Man Triathlon\" will be on August 19th in Masset, for you energetic people. There are two categories to compete in: Solo, and Relay. The third category is non-competitive, and invites anyone to come out and do whatever portion you want. I love the idea of participating at your own level.</p><p>Port Clements Rod and Gun are hosting an open Trapshoot, Sunday August 20th at 2pm. They have guns you may use if you want to shoot.</p><p>There is a poster up outside the Library on the bulletin board for Short Poems about Canada to be submitted to be published in a \"Poetry Anthology\". The deadline is Sept 30th to submit your entry to the local library. This could be very interesting for us literary buffs.</p><p>Now, on to the task of creating Fairies for the family Fairy Garden entry in the Fall Fair.

(CP) - A sleeping and unfriendly giant remained a threat to Salmon Arm Friday night as gusty winds stirred the stubborn blaze, making a long and hot day for ground crews.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 63-square-kilometre forest fire is burning in the mountains surrounding this idyllic city on the shores of Shuswap Lake despite the best efforts of firefighters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-BODY- \"There's a lot of smoke on the mountains because the winds pushed the fire into new fuel,'' said Mitzi Bushell, a spokeswoman for the B.C. Forest Service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"But the fire has not advanced, it's burning within itself.''</p><p>A cold front blew through the area, 500 kilometres east of Vancouver, in the late afternoon. Winds picked up, reaching gusts of up to 40 kilometres an hour, but the fire was largely held along the guard that has been cut by firefighters.</p><p>Ground crews had to contend with a couple of breaches of the fire guard, but they were able to quickly contain them, said Bushell. So while the smoke swirled above the city, its residents hunkered down for what they hoped would be a quiet late summer weekend.</p><p>The wind, which lasted well into the night, combined with searing 35C heat made for tough conditions for firefighters, who continued to extinguish hot spots.</p><p>Several new fires were also reported in the East Kootenay region and south of Revelstoke, but none were threatening communities.</p><p>On Aug. 5, the Salmon Arm fire took only an hour to race down one mountain and cross a two-kilometre-wide valley to ignite slopes on the opposite side. In addition to the 300 firefighters, including 100 soldiers on the ground, two massive Martin Mars waterbombers, 14 helicopters and more than 100 pieces of heavy equipment are battling the fire.</p><p>And while residents have praised those efforts, many are starting to question why the fire ever got to this stage.</p><p>Donna Mason, who manages a houseboat rental company, said residents - especially those who lost homes - deserve an explanation from the government.</p><p>Mason's business has been largely unaffected by the fire, except for a cancellation Friday because the client's children are asthmatic.</p><p>\"We've been telling people once they get out on the lake, \"Go and don't come back,' '' she said.</p><p>\"Lots of clients were excited and thrilled to be a part of the fire.''</p><p>Mason said her marine gas bar was fuelling boat after boat on Friday after a slowdown earlier in the week.</p><p>She is hoping the fire doesn't have a long-term effect on the all-important tourist trade in the area.</p><p>\"It's definitely not going to be as pretty as it was, seeing as Salmon Arm is surrounded by the three mountains that were on fire,'' she said.</p><p>\"They were beautiful, luscious and green and that's not going to be there next spring.''</p><p>Mason, who had to flee her home earlier this week, said Salmon Arm showed superior community spirit during the evacuation and she expects that will carry the city as it recovers.</p><p>\"But there's certainly a lot of question of why this fire got out of control, we all watched it burn for two weeks wondering why they didn't put it out.''</p><p>Bushell said there is an independent review of how every fire is handled. She said the concerns of residents about the response to the early stage of the fire would be looked at.</p><p>Meanwhile, Peter Kilby, the evacuation co-ordinator for the fire operation, said he's pleased with the level of readiness of emergency personnel if another move order has to be issued.</p><p>But he's concerned that some people in the city of 15,000 are dropping their guard.</p><p>He said the community remains on evacuation alert and officials spent Friday reminding people in the areas most at risk to remain ready to move at a moment's notice.</p><p>\"We have a concern there are a lot of people who've had a couple of nights on the couch with their feet up and a Coors in their hand watching television,'' said Kilby. About 20 rural homes were destroyed by the flames last week.</p><p>Gerree Loran, whose house is in the evacuation zone, said people are being lulled into a false sense of security. She's allowed in to the area for short periods but stays at a city hotel at night.</p><p>\"It's just as bad, there's just as much smoke as a week ago,'' she said.</p><p>\"This fire is burning all over the place. People don't realize the danger we're still in.''</p><p>The fire situation east of Salmon Arm also deteriorated late Friday.</p><p>Forest Service spokeswoman Karen Zuidinga said the areas south of Invermere in the East Kootenay and Nakusp - south of Revelstoke - had received a large number of lightning strikes.</p><p>\"We have a developing situation,'' she said from Castlegar, B.C. \"We've got a lot of fires being reported and we've got a lot of action.</p><p>\"We've got initial attack crews and the air tanker up.''</p><p>Fires also continued to burn in northwestern Alberta, parts of Saskatchewan and Northern Ontario. Hundreds of people have been removed from remote northern communities, but the situation in those provinces appears to be stabilizing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199808140208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4701-3B70-01G6-811M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 14, 1998 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001734</classCode><className>TOURISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It has become normal to expect forest fires every summer and people are getting weary of our ongoing reality.</p><p>What continues to boggle the mind is that people still seem oblivious to the extreme fire risk. Each day there are new social media posts or reports about smokers discarding their lit cigarettes out of their car windows or campers who feel a small fire is acceptable. We can't be so na\u00efve or selfish and put others at risk.</p><p>No one goes out expecting to start a forest fire, but things can quickly escalate. Weather has a significant impact on wildfires - in how they start, how aggressive they spread, and how long they burn. Our present fire behaviour rating is Extreme.</p><p>Currently, the conditions are worse than in the summer of 2003 when the region was devastated by the Okanagan Mountain Park fire. Every day, we get an update about the provincial state of emergency and a report on all of the new fires that have started. The province has already lost 435,000 hectares of wildland to wildfires this year compared to 150,000 hectares in an average year.</p><p>What is scary is that we've had several close calls. In recent weeks, we have seen wildfires in Kaleden, above the KVR trail towards Naramata, Highway 97 near Red Wing, and on the West Bench. Not surprisingly, many of the fires are human caused which means they are preventable. To try to reduce the risk, the City of Penticton along with the RDOS and PentictonIndian Band, issued a ban on all motorized vehicle use and smoking in natural areas within the city, West Bench and the Penticton Indian Band lands. We all need to be more aware and cautious.</p><p>The city is taking extra steps to prepare for wildfires in the area. Our fire department has been staffing up and city staff have been training and participating in mock emergencies so that we are ready to respond to a wildfire where evacuations may be necessary. I am thankful we are being proactive and grateful that our protective service professionals have acted so quickly and effectively thus far.</p><p>All residents have a responsibility to be prepared as well. I encourage you to develop a household plan that also includes pets and livestock, put together an emergency kit, connect with your neighbors, family and friends so when an event takes place you feel prepared. If you only had minutes to pack up and leave your home, what would you take?

If this is our future, it's a lot tougher game, isn't it?\"</p><p>The company which offers guided hut-to-hut backcountry hiking trips in the summer for small groups was shut down for three weeks in 2017 when the province closed Wells Gray Provincial Park due to fire danger.</p><p>This year, many of his guests called to cancel because of the smoke but Eakins, 63, said he was able to convince most that the air would be clear and the views magnificent once they got out of the valleys and onto mountain trails above the haze.</p><p>The 2018 fires burned more than 1.3 million hectares of forest, surpassing the total from the record set the previous year when the province was in a state of emergency for a much longer 10-week period.</p><p>Many tourism businesses have suffered losses from the back-to-back fire seasons but the damage to B.C.'s brand could be just as costly, said Jeremy Stone, an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia who has conducted research into economic and business resilience to disasters.</p><p>\"The brand damage, that's the much more difficult one... You really start to become associated with, 'This is not a place I should be,'\" he said. He said a recent news story about a European tourist who was evacuated due to fire for the second year in a row this summer is an example of the hits B.C.'s reputation is taking.</p><p>The province is trying to mitigate and prevent wildfires but tourism operators should be dealing with what looks like a continuing risk by offering and promoting fall, spring and winter options rather than relying too heavily on the peak summer season, he said.</p><p>Hotel occupancy statistics will show Prince George, B.C., had a great summer but the numbers don't tell the whole story, said Annie Doran, marketing manager for the local tourism bureau.</p><p>\"Our accommodations have been full two summers in a row due to large numbers of evacuees coming to Prince George as the main evacuation centre,\" she said.</p><p>\"It was incredibly smoky. We basically had six weeks of no sunshine, just cloaked in with smoke,\" Doran said, adding the industry reported many cancellations or abbreviated trips.</p><p>Smoke that spilled over the border into Alberta caused more than 3,000 guests to cancel helicopter sight-seeing tours from locations near Banff National Park and in the Badlands of southern Alberta, reported Todd Johnson, director of business development for Alpine Helicopters.</p><p>He said it was a bad summer all around, estimating a total of 10,000 guests cancelled, leading to a $1-million revenue shortfall.</p><p>\"We had a lot of cancellations due to weather and then, when the weather improved, of course, fire season kicked in and it was smoke, so we had to cancel or give guests the option of not going just because of the visibility,\" he said.</p><p>He said the fires are a \"black eye\" for the industry.</p><p>\"The whole point is to see the mountains, to be up close and personal to those big mountains.\"</p><p>The fires led to many cancellations throughout B.C. this year and statistics will likely show a substantial impact on tourism when they are released, said Walt Judas, CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of B.C.</p><p>He said there may be an impact on bookings next year but he doesn't expect a long-term reduction because demand for B.C.'s tourism product is growing in new markets such as China, Mexico and Australia and is steady in traditional markets such as the United States.</p><p>Follow @HealingSlowly on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2b6d45458d7e4d778e9830cfd3fdd8a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCV-FX91-DY9S-T0NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 30, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He was on the BC School Trustees Association; sat on the municipal tax appeal board and was a member of the Sentinel Masonic Lodge.</p><p>Both were involved in the Red Cross Disaster Response and Disaster Assistance programs, helping with floods in Manitoba, the response to the 9-11 terror attacks in New York, and forest fire disaster in Kelowna, just naming a few. They also help feed and clothe poor and homeless people through an initiative of their local church.</p><p>There are many other smaller, personal acts of giving and support the crowd heard about during an open-mic session honouring the couple.</p><p>But Inga Lamont told the crowd the honour doesn't just belong to them.</p><p>\"It's not me and Jim only, it's everybody else who has helped us,\" she said in her acceptance speech. \"Because you can't do things by yourself. \"You have to have support, you have to have people who will back you up and people you can count on. And it doesn't matter what we have done, there has always been a large group of people to help.</p><p>\"I want to thank everyone, the Knights for honouring us, but I want to accept the honour on behalf of all the volunteers who have worked with us.\"</p><p>Her husband echoed the sentiments, and while they are entering their senior years, he said their commitment to help others would continue.</p><p>\"We have never done anything in the assistance of others for the benefit of ourselves,\" Jim Lamont said in his acceptance speech. \"That is just not the way we work. And when we have completed the good act and returned to the multitude with no further ceremony, we are content with what has happened.\"</p><p>\"We shall continue to do whatever is asked of us to improve the plight of others, until the time is no more.\"</p><p>The couple will be honoured on a float on the weekend during the Sun Fest parade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-3599665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SG0-BJS1-F105-64W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Castlegar News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 31, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001ZY4</classCode><className>KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>EASTER SEALS INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

At the 11th hour, unsettled weather and change of wind direction saved the day.</p><p>Our ACMG guides Tim McAllister, Jennifer Olson and Kirk Mauthner once again led us safely across the slippery slopes of high adventure, beginning with an airy ridge walk in the Rockies.</p><p>At the midway point on the ridge, an exposed 30 meter vertical lower above the emerald tarn at Pedley Pass, followed by an endless scree run back to Bumpy Meadows got the climbing muscles limber and the teens were ready for some snow and ice in the Purcells the next day.</p><p>We spent a big chunk of the next day roped up and navigating the glacier that flows from the summit of Redline Peak. At rest breaks we could look across the valley and trace the route that Kain and Albert and Bess MacCarthy took during their bold first ascents of Farnham Tower, and Mt Farnham, the high point of the Purcells.</p><p>As an added bonus, we were joined by Snowpatch the wunderhund, who fearlessly ventured where no crevasse poodle had gone before.</p><p>On our final day, we set out on a hike to the west of Wilmer to a stellar viewpoint of the valley, topped off by a refreshing dip in Lake Enid.</p><p>Melissa Howe, mother of teens Megan and David from Kimberley, reflected on what went through her mind when she and Len dropped them off in Wilmer. \"It's hard to leave thinking about the potential dangers that could be in encountered in a wilderness hiking situation. I left my kids there fully confident that they would have a great time, be safe and responsible and be completely looked after. When they got back my kids told me they were challenged by the various climbing and hiking exercises. It was a real experience with real mountain guides in a real mountain setting.</p><p>\"Megan and David made some new friends from other towns and even made plans for future get togethers. I fully recommend this Conrad Kain experience for any older teen who is looking for true adventure.\"</p><p>A big thanks from the CKCS to all the \"Kain Teeners\" for being such good partners on the rope, to Wilmer Community Club for providing a comfy base for our program, AG Valley Foods in Invermere who gave me a Senior's discount on the group's food, and Columbia Basin Trust for its Community Initiatives grant.

I don't understand that people here don't get that fact.\"</p><p>Maple Ridge's ban is city-wide, encompassing rural areas where backyard burning is allowed at certain times of the year. In the urban or suburban areas, burning is never allowed.</p><p>Exner said the seven tickets were all issued to people who lit campfires in their backyards, two of which were in Silver Valley in north Maple Ridge. Some of those were in the suburbs that were near forest areas.</p><p>He added that sparks don't need to land among the trees to start a wildfire. That can happen by having grass set alight, which can then spread to the forest.</p><p>Firefighters responded to one big backyard fire in east Maple Ridge on Sunday that was so big people thought it was a house fire. That drew three trucks from Maple Ridge and two from Mission, only to find out that the fire was caused by someone doing a backyard burn of brush or some other material.</p><p>That left the department late on calls in the downtown.</p><p>Exner said despite the rain on the weekend, the forest fire danger rating remains at high, just below the extreme level.</p><p>The department received a total of 14 complaints about people starting fires. But for half of those, people had already put out the campfires.</p><p>\"To quote one of the officers, just as we arrived on scene, 'All of a sudden a big steam cloud appeared behind the house and we found a wet campfire.'\"</p><p>The fire department only responds to complaints that people call in.</p><p>Under Maple Ridge fire department's ban:</p><p>\u00b7 all camping and recreational fires regularly allowed in the open-to-burning area of Maple Ridge are now prohibited (the use of hibachis or other briquette BBQs and ULC/CSA listed propane BBQs and fire pits are permitted at this time);</p><p>\u00b7 the discharge of all fireworks, sky lanterns or pyrotechnics is also prohibited during this campfire ban.</p><p>\u00b7 during a fire ban, you can only use CSA-rated or ULC-rated cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes, or a portable apparatus that uses briquettes, liquid or gaseous fuel, as long as the height of the flame is less than 15 cm.</p><p>B.C. Wildfire Service has a webpage showing how people live near forests can increases their home's resistance to fires.</p><p>Community Wildfire Protection plan and specialized equipment and taining to deal with forest fires.</p><p>Maple Ridge also has a Wildfire Protection Plan to reduce the risks.</p><p>Campfires are banned throughout B.C., including all parks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MARNWS-3404324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MARNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P43-CN31-JDH3-G3RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438227</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Maple Ridge News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001645</classCode><className>SUBURBS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

There is a lot of work in the coming days,\" said Doyle.</p><p>Highway 5A was reopened Monday, and most evacuees in that area were allowed to return to their homes the previous day. Summers Creek Road remained closed Tuesday with 17 properties still on evacuation alert.</p><p>A team specializing in the assessment of dangerous trees - trees that might contain embers or sparks, or be weakened by fire and fall down an incline - was examined that passageway Tuesday.</p><p>\"As soon as they are happy with the area they will reopen it.\"</p><p>The 12-member Princeton IMT is part of a 53-person contingent from Australia that arrived in British Columbia last Wednesday to aid in the battle against 155 wildfires in the province.</p><p>Doyle said the team here is used to the conditions of the Princeton fire.</p><p>\"Whilst it's different, a lot of the east coast of Australia is similar terrain.\"</p><p>The last time Australian crews responded to a request for aid from the Canadian government was 2015.</p><p>The Australia fire season is opposite to BC's, he added, and the Australian crews expect to be here until September 1.</p><p>\"That's when things start getting warm [there].

The wedding was held outside the hall, located at 11099 Maddock Ave., followed by the wedding party photos at the Ex Nihilo Winery vineyards.</p><p>The reception followed and guests were beginning to be served supper at 6:30 p.m. when Loehndorf says all hell broke loose.</p><p>\"I met up with the police at the entrance way to the hall, and they were very professional in looking out for the best safety interests of everyone that we all had to go,\" Loehndorf said.</p><p>With some quick thinking, the reception party literally was picked up and moved to a new location, creating one that Loehndorf called one of those magical moments when people come together to create and celebrate a special moment in time, something that wasn't lost on his daughter despite the fire and smoke.</p><p>\"She gave a speech on the deck of the house with all the smoke in the background but that didn't really matter. She was tearing up in thanking everyone for making their wedding such a special event despite everything that happened,\" he said.</p><p>\"They were still able to cut the wedding cake and have their first traditional dance on the balcony of the house.</p><p>\"At that point it didn't matter what was happening outside. It was about the love shared between a couple starting out their lives together, and how everyone else there was happy for them.</p><p>\"In the end, the love between my daughter and her husband came out on top of everything else.\"</p><p>The happy couple were left with a memorable wedding day that won't soon be forgotten as they headed off for a honeymoon in Naramata before returning to their home in New Westminster.</p><p>Loehndorf added that a sudden change in wedding plans doesn't compare to those who lost their homes or animals.</p><p>\"Those are the folks we really need to focus on.

In view of the recent outbreaks of wildfires in British Columbia, and elsewhere, this is the right time to tell the story of Canada's first smoke jumpers, the original 125 men who worked in Saskatchewan jumping from planes to put out forest fires. The Saskatchewan Fire Jumpers, as they were known, began their mission in 1947 and continued until 1967 when the group disbanded.</p><p>During that time period, these men were an important element in the fighting of forest fires. The water bomber hadn't yet appeared on the scene. Well trained as firefighters and as parachutists, the jumpers would be flown to an area where a small forest fire had been started, usually by lightning strike, and would jump to the site where they would have to work hard on the ground to extinguish the fire. This was not as easy as it may sound. For one thing, they would have to jump with all the equipment they would need, as well as enough food to last several days. Once the fire was out, they would have to hike to a location on a lake or river where a floatplane could land and pick them up. This might be several miles from the fire site. The whole process was a very strenuous one, so these men had to be in excellent physical condition. Regular exercise was an important part of their training.</p><p>In 2014, Hope Pedersen, wife of smoke jumper Olaf \"Swede\" Pedersen, decided to write a book so that the history of the early smoke jumpers wouldn't be lost or forgotten. There had been previous attempts to write about this group of brave men, but somehow they had fallen by the wayside.</p><p>When helicopters and water bombers came into existence, it was considered that smoke jumpers were no longer needed. However, there are still many in North America, including Canada. These intrepid men are put to work, usually in remote and mountainous areas such as British Columbia. Most of us rarely hear about them and the work they do.</p><p>Modern aerial firefighting is a very precise procedure. When there is a big fire, spotter planes circle the area with trained spotters who send information to aerial crews about where and when to drop their loads of water. The water bombers are large planes with a crew of only two. The planes skim over the surface of a local lake, picking up huge loads of water which is then dropped on the fire at the designated location. Sometimes fire retardant is added to the water to help keep the fire in check.</p><p>Aerial firefighters played a large part in controlling large fires near Kelowna and Fort McMurray. Most summers, they put out dozens of smaller fires that threaten remote towns and villages. However, when there is little snow to leave moisture in the ground and too much rain in the spring, as happened this year, firefighters are often left \"on standby\" waiting for the order to take off.</p><p>In Southern Ontario we seldom think of forest fires and the effort that goes into keeping towns and villages, even cities, safe. The story of the first aerial firefighters, the Saskatchewan Smoke Jumpers, is an important part of our history.</p><p>Thanks to Hope Pedersen for putting it all into readable form.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2017071943071233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2T-MR21-JDH3-G2YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

She was tearing up in thanking everyone for making their wedding such a special event despite everything that happened,\" he said.</p><p>\"They were still able to cut the wedding cake and have their first traditional dance on the balcony of the house.</p><p>\"At that point it didn't matter what was happening outside.

This was largely due to actions and decisions taken by homeowners who had adopted FireSmart\u00ae mitigation measures to a greater degree than the owners of adjacent homes who did not take such actions. In 'Why some homes survived: Learning from the Fort McMurray wildland/urban interface disaster', researcher/author Alan Westhaver sought to answer the question: 'Why did some homes survive this wildland/urban interface fire with little or no damage, while others were vulnerable to ignition and destroyed?'</p><p>The May 2016 Fort McMurray wildland/urban interface fire disaster provided an unprecedented opportunity to learn firsthand about the survival and ignition of homes located in the interface, where communities and built assets abut forested lands.</p><p>After evaluating the fire environment and clearances between homes and the forest edge, Westhaver discounted direct contact from flames or radiant heat of the forest fire as being significant sources of home ignition at Fort McMurray. Instead, he concluded that wind-driven embers were the most probable cause for the majority of early home ignitions in those areas where the fire made its transition from forest into urban neighbourhoods.</p><p>Overall, observations made during this investigation confirm that the Fort McMurray disaster followed a well-recognized pattern known as the 'wildland/urban interface disaster sequence'. This progression can only be broken, and disaster avoided, by substantially increasing the proportion of homes that are resistant to ignition -- especially by embers.</p><p>\"Home survival in these circumstances is not random, nor is it a function of luck,\" says Westhaver. \"Whether a home is destroyed by an interface wildfire or not greatly depends on conditions immediately around the structure, the area for which homeowners are responsible.\"</p><p>\"This research is not about placing blame,\" says Westhaver. \"It is about better understanding the sequence of events that lead to wildland/urban interface fire losses and communicating findings to important stakeholders -- like homeowners and other private property owners -- to prevent repeats of such disasters in the same, and other communities in the Canadian interface.\"</p><p>Westhaver's findings closely align with those from similar case studies and research conducted elsewhere, particularly in the United States and Australia.</p><p>The final report containing these and other conclusions and results can be downloaded for free in PDF format at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iclr.org\">www.iclr.org</url></p><p>Established in 1998 by Canada's property and casualty insurers, ICLR is an independent, not-for-profit research institute based in Toronto and at Western University in London, Canada.

(\"Universal Copper\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the commencement of it's 2019 exploration program at its 62,000 hectare Poplar copper property, southwest of Houston, British Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prior to executing the 2019 drilling program, Universal is undertaking ground surveys to evaluate a number of the peripheral gold targets identified during historic exploration programs and/or by the 2018 Long Wave InfraRed Survey (See December 11, 2017 News Release). The program will consist of prospecting, mapping, soil and rock sampling concentrating in the western portion of the property where last year's forest fire should provide new outcrop exposure in a number of the target areas. The Company anticipates developing multiple drill targets as a result of this exploration program.</p><p>Universal completed a widely spaced three-hole diamond drill program late in 2018 (See January 22, 2019 News Release). Highlights from the drilling campaign include:</p><p>* 18-PC-126 was mineralized from top of bedrock to full depth, averaging 0.365% Cu, 0.015% Mo, 0.145g/t Au and 2.31 g/t Ag over 380.97 metres. The last 30.17 metres contained the strongest mineralization: 0.554% Cu, 0.027% Mo, 0.104g/t Au and 4.44 g/t Ag; indicating the historic IP conclusion of mineralization continuing to depth appears valid.</p><p>* 18-PC-127 was mineralized from top of bedrock to full depth, averaging 0.421% Cu, 0.013% Mo, 0.105g/t Au and 2.63 g/t Ag over 264.86 metres, including a 27 metre interval averaging 0.643% Cu, 0.030% Mo, 0.146g/t Au and 2.62 g/t Ag.</p><p>* 18-PC-127 intersected 0.330% Cu, 0.002 % Mo, 0.118 g/t Au and 3.46 g/t Ag over 151.10 metres between 122.8 metres and 273.9 metres</p><p>* Mineralization consists of both dissemination pyrite and chalcopyrite and stockwork vein to veinlet pyrite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite.</p><p>Table is available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/548337/Universal-Commences-2019-Exploration-Popl\">https://www.accesswire.com/548337/Universal-Commences-2019-Exploration-Popl</url> ar-Copper-Property</p><p>About the Poplar</p><p>The Poplar copper deposit hosts an historical indicated mineral resource of 131 million tonnes grading 0.31 per cent copper, 0.009 per cent molybdenum, 0.09 gram per tonne gold and 2.39 grams per tonne silver, and a historical inferred mineral resource of 132 million tonnes grading 0.27 per cent Cu, 0.005 per cent Mo, 0.07 g/t Au and 3.75 g/t Ag has been identified through the drilling of 147 historical holes. These historical indicated and inferred resources were disclosed by Lions Gate Metals Inc. in its technical report dated March 30, 2012, prepared by Gary Giroux, PEng.</p><p>To determine the historical resource, a 3-D solid was constructed to constrain the mineralized area, using a 0.1-per-cent-copper-grade shell as a guide. Large internal waste zones were modelled as were some larger-post-mineral dikes. Of the total database, 129 drill holes totalling 37,205 metres were within the mineralized zone and were used to estimate the resource. Drill holes were compared with the mineralized solid, and assays were tagged if inside. Copper, molybdenum, gold and silver assays within the mineralized solid were capped at 1.4 per cent Cu, 0.14 per cent Mo, 0.34 g/t Au and 41 g/t Ag, respectively. Five-metre composites were formed and used for variography.</p><p>For this estimate and to aid with some preliminary planning, the blocks were reduced to five by five by 10 metres in dimension and were estimated for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag by ordinary kriging. The historical resource is classified as indicated and inferred based on each block's proximity to data and the grade continuity. The historical indicated and historical inferred resource uses the categories set out in Section 1.2 of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>Universal Copper will need to review and verify the historical drilling database and twin a number of the existing drill holes to make the historical resources current. Investors are cautioned a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and therefore the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>R.

We have new research from the Cariboo on the effects of B.C.'s post-World War II 'war on forest fires,' and the fuel load from that and beetle kill has left an enormous threat. What's the next step for the B.C. government in 2018?</p><p>fletcher mug</p><p>JH: I met [in early December] with mayors from the Interior, Quesnel, through Prince George, Fort St. James, to talk about fibre supply and the forest sector and how do we prepare for next year's fire season. There's nothing we can do about the season past.</p><p>I appointed George Abbott, a former B.C. Liberal cabinet minister, member for Shuswap, so he knows the Interior, and Maureen Chapman, an indigenous leader from the Sto:lo Nation, to work together to provide us with some answers on not just what happened. We've had successive reports that have said we need to address the interface between the forests and communities and getting fuel off the forest floor is critical to managing fires.</p><p>So that's a part of what I expect they'll come back with. I don't want to be critical of the lack of work on these issues. It's not to find blame for last year, it's to prepare for next year. And I think George Abbott is uniquely suited as a former minister of forests, of Indigenous relations, and a host of other things, to bring to bear his experience.</p><p>We came together after 16 years in opposition and we dropped right down into the worst fire season ever, in areas where we did not have representation in the legislature, and that was difficult. And I give full marks to the MLAs in the region, while the fires were burning there was a sense of cooperation.</p><p>We need to prepare for next year.</p><p>TF: Mr. Abbott's job is also to look at the viability of logging contractors and the state of the industry in general, leaving aside the U.S. trade situation. In terms of log exports or incentives to mill locally, what's ahead in 2018?</p><p>JH: I heard from the mayors of Mackenzie, Vanderhoof, Fort St. James, quite clearly about the former rule that if companies harvest Crown land logs, they had to process those logs in that area. That was done away with by the B.C. Liberals, and that has led to super-mills and towns losing forestry jobs. We want to see what we can do to turn that around.</p><p>First, we want to get that burned wood out of the forest while it's merchantable. That means accelerating permits. [Forests Minister] Doug Donaldson is working on that in the short term.</p><p>We have a significant challenge on the land base, in the Interior particularly, when it comes to fibre supply, and we need to work with communities and look at how we develop policies to keep jobs in communities, not export them to super-mills or offshore.</p><p>On the Coast, a completely different set of problems. I am very concerned, in my own community of Sooke, when I see the volume of trucks filled with logs, going right past where the old mill used to be, and several other mills, to tidewater to send those logs somewhere else.</p><p>The public has had enough of that.</p><p>Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press.

He is a fire ranger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his eight years on the job, Bryson, 29, has never seen anything like the blaze he's been battling this week in northern Alberta, about 100 kilometres north of the fire-ravaged town of Slave Lake.</p><p>\"Definitely not of this size and this magnitude,\" the Sault Ste. Marie native shouted over a crackling cellphone on a brief break from the front lines.</p><p>\"There's a whole lot of fire,\" he said as a chopper whooped nearby, waiting for him to jump on board.</p><p>The death of a helicopter pilot who crashed while on a firefighting mission in the area Friday was a tragic reminder of the dangers faced by those who battle fires in the wild. The pilot had been working near Slave Lake, where fires spurred by high winds destroyed a third of the town and forced 7,000 residents to evacuate last week.</p><p>Federal investigators say the wildfire may interfere with their probe into the crash.</p><p>Fire rangers are highly skilled firefighters who are specially trained to battle wildfires deep in the woods, where they work up to 14 hours a day, every day, for two straight weeks. The shifts are long, the heat is stifling and the air is bone dry. And in Alberta, the mosquitoes are unforgiving.</p><p>About 80 wildfire fighters from Ontario were sent to Alberta after fires broke out around the province and another 20 were to arrive this weekend. Ontario is a part of the national forest fire mutual support system, which means other provinces can ask to borrow its fire rangers and vice versa.</p><p>Bryson has been here since last Tuesday, when his crew flew to Edmonton, hopped buses north and set to work immediately.</p><p>They barrel into the bush with a kit of hand tools, a tent and enough food to last 24 hours. They are supported by trucks and helicopters that carry water pumps, hoses and other firefighting equipment.</p><p>\"It's long, hard work. It's very tiring. And it's very rewarding,\" said Fred Welch, a former ranger who is now a planning coordinator for Ontario's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services.</p><p>Between two-week stints, rangers break for only a couple of days before they're on to the next fire.</p><p>There are 53 wildfires burning in Alberta, 10 of which are out of control. The numbers have dropped by more than half since earlier in the week. Across Alberta, there are more than 2,000 workers supporting wildfire suppression operations, including nearly 500 firefighters imported from Ontario and British Columbia.</p><p>Alberta announced in a news release Saturday the evacuation order for Slave Lake was being extended for another seven days due to hot spots and other safety concerns, The Canadian Press reported.</p><p>Bryson's crew will remain in the bush until June 3.</p><p>\"Some days are longer than others,\" he says, \"but knowing we're helping people out pushes us to keep going.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ontario fire ranger Mike Bryson arrived in Alberta Tuesday to help fight wildfires.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2011052216416495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CWC-XNN1-DY91-K057-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>May 22, 2011 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The fires have cost $30 million and could drain $150 million or more from Manitoba's economy in lost revenue from such things as tourism, fishing and logging.</p><p>\"It could be double that,\" Driedger said. \"It's going to have a dramatic economic effect.\"</p><p>Scattered rain and cooler temperatures helped firefighters throughout the region, but many fires remained out of control and thick white smoke cut visibility to a few metres in some areas.</p><p>So far, there have been no injuries directly attributed to the fires, but one elderly Manitoba woman was reported to have died from a heart attack brought on by the stress of being moved from her home.</p><p>At last count, about 2,000 firefighters were dealing with some of the 227 fires burning in Manitoba; another 1,700 were battling 155 in Saskatchewan. Ground crews in those two provinces were being aided by more than 120 aircraft.</p><p>In Ontario, there were 188 fires and 1,500 firefighters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR1989</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3WG1-XN80-00H1-R4X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1989 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"07\" day=\"28\" year=\"1989\"><dateText>July 28, 1989, Friday, ME2</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>WINNIPEG HOTEL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>WINNIPEG HOTEL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N923130JC</classCode><className>SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000209</classCode><className>BREASTFEEDING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Not long after it was published he went blind, suddenly making the text inaccessible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then he came up with a solution: an audiobook, recorded right here in the Kootenays, with a local performer to bring his elaborate cast of characters to life. After holding auditions in his living room, he agreed to embark on the project with Jeff Forst.</p><p>And he couldn't be happier with the result.</p><p>\"Jeff made the book alive. He had voices for all the characters that were real and convincing, and each had a psychic integrity. To watch that happen, to watch him make it real, was so moving,\" Moore told the Star , after releasing the title online through Audible.</p><p>\"I have no way to thank Jeff for doing what he did. It felt like he was incarnating the book, like the characters were speaking through him.\"</p><p>The story follows a woman named Ann Pratt who is raising her only grandchild in a small logging town reminiscent of Kaslo called Lesker. It's forest fire season as another boy, \"burning like sulphuric acid through every life he touches,\" comes to town. According to Moore, if it was a movie, it would get an R rating.</p><p>\"I've written novels all my life, but I've never brought something to this sort of completion. There's a lot of me in there. I've had, in my own life, some very difficult experiences and some of them are built into the book in some way,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'm not a violent person, but I've always been drawn to violence and I want to understand how it works.\"</p><p>The narrative doesn't shy away from the seedier side of life, and the characters go through disturbing and sexually explicit experiences. That appealed to Forst as he was preparing for the role, and as he delved into it one particular quote kept coming to mind, from Bruce Cockburn: \"Gotta kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight.\"</p><p>\"That captures Bill's book, that phrase,\" Forst said.</p><p>\"Bill delves into a sort of universal psyche, there's this idea of exploring darkness that you can tell he's lived, and I've read so many books that will go there and leave you there. But with Bill's book there's a love and light woven into this extreme darkness, and that really appealed to me.\"</p><p>It wasn't easy to record, though. It took them months upon months, and at one point they had to take a break, but ultimately it clocked in at just under ten hours. When all was said and done, Forst had created dozens of characters.</p><p>\"I was impressed with Bill's resilience. We ended up actually building our own little recording studio out at Six Mile, and there was dogs out there and the lake in the background, so the book was really alive in that space. It was such an amazing process,\" he said.</p><p>And now Moore's excited to share it with the rest of the community.</p><p>\"This book will take you through some difficult places but there's a kind of victory at the end and you need to walk through the eye of the needle to get there.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3397736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P1H-P391-JDH3-G1WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 14, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIER</classCode><className>FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5QC</classCode><className>MOVIE RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D5FK</classCode><className>ASTROLOGISTS &amp; PSYCHICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5QC</classCode><className>MOVIE RATINGS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) _ Mike Barre asked his community for forgiveness on Tuesday before a judge ordered him to pay a $3,000 fine for dropping a cigarette that started a devastating wildfire in B.C.'s southern Interior in 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I will never forget about this part of my life. It was totally devastating,'' Barre told Judge William Sundhu. \"I just hope the people of the area can forgive me for what I've done.''</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>CP</p></bodyText></section><p>Defence lawyer John Hogg said his client has \"gone through hell'' since he dropped the burning cigarette on a tinder-dry hill behind his McLure house and the consequences of the fire it sparked will haunt him the rest of his life.</p><p>Not a day goes by, said Hogg, that Barre doesn't think of the blaze, the devastation it caused and the people it affected.</p><p>More than 75 houses were destroyed by the wildfire, as well as Tolko's sawmill at Louis Creek. Thousands were left temporarily homeless.</p><p>\"In terms of who he is \u2026 the effect has been tremendous,'' Hogg told the court. \"No one wants to walk in his shoes. He's still suffering, your honour. He'll suffer for life.</p><p>\"Will he cope with it? I think he will. I think he is. Is there ever a day when it is not on his mind? I think there is not.''</p><p>Barre was convicted earlier this month of dropping a lit substance within one kilometre of a forest.</p><p>Sundhu said deterrence is the main purpose of sentencing in this instance, adding the fine must be large enough so everyone understands they have a duty to act responsibly in B.C.'s forests.</p><p>Barre, 52, said he has made many personal apologies in the months since the fire. The single father also recently wrote a letter of apology in the North Thompson Star Journal.</p><p>Sundhu said it's clear there will be long-term consequences for Barre.</p><p>\"There is a stigma attached to this and he will have to live with it for the rest of his days,'' said Sundhu.</p><p>But the judge also noted the powerful expression of forgiveness for Barre expressed by the very people who lost homes and jobs because of his cigarette.</p><p>\"A good many people appear to be sympathetic and understanding,'' Sundhu added. \"They were directly impacted, yet they are prepared to forgive him and accept (him) as a member of the community.''</p><p>Prosecutor Jonathan Oliphant said the Crown did not seek a restitution order because it was clear such an order would have been impractical. The costs of fighting the fire exceeded $30 million.</p><p>Oliphant said there are other forums better suited to deciding if and how much Barre should be held financially responsible.</p><p>A number of civil lawsuits have been filed, the judge was told, including one more since Barre's conviction.</p><p>Oliphant said public education was always central to the Crown's handling of the case.</p><p>\"People have asked me what was the purpose of prosecuting Mr. Barre in this case,'' he said. \"Educating others and raising awareness. It's not going to stop forest fires, of course not.</p><p>\"The fundamental (message) is, I think, when you go into the woods, think before you smoke, and think about what you are going to do with your cigarette.''</p><p>Outside the courtroom, Barre said he's glad the trial is over.</p><p>\"I just want to get on with my life,'' he said.</p><p>Barre was charged with of dropping a burning substance within one kilometre of a forest after he tried to stomp out a cigarette near his home in Barriere, north of Kamloops.</p><p>In earlier finding Barre guilty, Sundhu said he \"was not paying attention'' when he stomped out a cigarette.</p><p>Despite the devastation, many area residents stood behind Barre. About 1,400 people recently signed a petition calling on the Crown to stay the charge against Barre.</p><p>One of the organizers of the petition has said it was designed to show support for the man many believe did all he could in the circumstances to stop the fire from spreading.</p><p>Barre admitted during his trial that the fire started just moments after he stomped out a cigarette on a path behind his house. The fire eventually grew to more than 260 square kilometres in size.</p><p>Homes and businesses in the tiny municipalities north of Kamloops of McLure, Barriere, Louis Creek and other surrounding communities were evacuated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20051129CPCPG8020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4HP3-MFV0-01G6-91PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>November 29, 2005 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>JUSTICE; ENVIRONMENT; FORESTRY; POLITICS;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001883</classCode><className>DECISIONS &amp; RULINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp; PENALTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000984</classCode><className>JUDGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4J6</classCode><className>CRIMINAL FINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001040</classCode><className>LITIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A4JU</classCode><className>CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001550</classCode><className>SENTENCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX000863</classCode><className>HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009X8Y</classCode><className>SINGLE PARENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
