The C.N. Railroad built them two nice cabins at Mile 100, known as Waburn Siding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two bridges were built at Irvine; the first was a wooden trestle type to enable the trains to start running in 1915. A second bridge was started in 1916 beside the first bridge; this one had cement piers and was made of steel.</p><p>This was a tremendous undertaking and supplied work for many people in the valley.</p><p>Another bridge built in the area was the Lions Creek wooden trestle at Cottonwood Flats, just north of Avola. This was also a very high one and was damaged by fire when an uncontrolled forest fire raged through the area.</p><p>An oncoming train crossed the bridge while it was on fire. One of the conductors on this train was \"Sharkie\" Shawm Winnifred Sedgwick's father.</p><p>The bridge was repaired, but soon another decision was made to fill the canyon. A narrow gauge track was put in uphill and was used to haul fill material to the construction site, taking three years.</p><p>Also in this area is Little Tunnel at Messiter. This tunnel was used until the late 1930s when it started to deteriorate. Originally it was thought to be of rock but with train traffic increasing, it started to crumble and became unusable as it turned out to be sandstone and clay instead. An alternate route was made around the area.</p><p>In the late 1920s, there was a big problem with the CN bridge, just north of Birch Island. They figured it had been damaged in the flood of 1928. A decision was made to try and lower the level of the North Thompson River to enable repairs to be made in 1929. A diversion was made through a small gully, which lowered the river enough to permit repairs to the bridge. After the water started down the gully it was hard to stop it as it involved a large part of the river going down the wrong way.</p><p>As a result of this diversion, several acres of Bill Hayworth's land washed away. He asked for compensation and after receiving the money he was murdered.</p><p>Someone who knew he had this money, shot him with a shotgun through the window of his home. It was felt the culprit was a local person, but this was never proven.</p><p>The thieves knocked down the door and ransacked the place, spilling sugar, rolled oats, etc., on the floor. It was thought that this was to cover up the bloodstains, but the mystery was solved when old Bill's groceries were sold to neighbours and they found $20 bills in some of the rolled oats, flour and sugar containers.</p><p>Bill had not trusted banks and had hidden his money in his groceries. No doubt there were lots of people who had queer places of hiding their money. After the thieves left, Old Bill crawled to his bed, where he froze to death before neighbours found him.</p><p>Apparently, about this time, Tom Montgomery, a prospector, and dear old soul, had shot a deer, and did not want his neighbours to know, so he took a route close to Bill Hayworth's cabin, back to his own home, not knowing there was a murder. The native tracker, looking for the murderer, discovered Tom's tracks and followed them to Tom's place.</p><p>This horrified Tom when he thought that anyone could think that he had been involved and people say this is why he left town. Tom was very active in the valley, staying for periods of time at Moilliets, prospecting, mapping the area, and was trusted by many people. He took Ted Moilliet, when 12-years-old, up Foghorn Mountain to show him the tunnels.</p><p>Montgomery, with partner Dan Dobson, discovered the Lydia mine at Birch Island. Dan sold the mine and left town, not giving Tom any money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-3994180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXR-NRB1-JDH1-C1BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Barriere Star Journal (N.

That's later than usual. We usually have our first pre-season tournament by that first weekend of August in Chilliwack, and then our Bronze Boot tournament is always held later that month, but not this year. It's all been very different.\"</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; RELATED STORY, from 2019: FOOTBALL: 50 years of Bronze Boot battles in Surrey.</p><p>(Story continues below)</p><p>Because of COVID-19, the players, coaches, officials and spectators must adapt to new rules and regulations.</p><p>\"Every player and coach gets checked in when they arrive, with standard questions regarding COVID and possible exposures, and their temperature is checked, hands sanitized, and then only the participants &amp;#x26;#8211; players and coaches &amp;#x26;#8211; are allowed on the field during a practice or game,\" McPherson said. \"We have extra sanitization of equipment before, during and after. There are also separate entry and exit areas at the parks, so we're not crossing paths too often.\"</p><p>North Surrey's home games are played at Bear Creek Park.</p><p>\"I just got word from the City of Surrey that for our bleachers, two of them, each one is considered its own event, so we can have 50 (spectators) on each of those, so that's good news for us, but some parks won't be so lucky,\" McPherson added.</p><p>With high school football not expected to happen in B.C. this year, club football is the only game for kids to play right now.</p><p>North Surrey will field nine football teams this fall.</p><p>\"I would say our numbers are a little bit down this year, but some of that has to do with having to limit our roster sizes, because of the 50-person gathering limit,\" McPherson said. \"We can only have that many people on the field at one time, and we have to consider refs, the crews that run the sticks, the game commissioner, so that leaves us with smaller numbers of players. We're only running nine-man football, in all divisions and clubs, where in previous years clubs had the option of doing nine- or 12-man football, and North Surrey is historically a 12-man club.\"</p><p>Whatever the format, it's football season.</p><p>\"We're happy to get going,\" McPherson added. \"It's going to look a lot different this season, with extra time between games to sanitize the equipment and field and benches, goalpost pads, all that stuff. It'll be some extra work but it all kind of balances out though, because we've chosen not to run the concession, where it would be a little hard to keep distance, so we don't have to take care of all the food stuff there. That's hard for our fundraising, but we'll use those volunteers elsewhere.\"</p><p>Online, North Surrey Minor Football is at surreyfootball.com.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tom.zillich@surreynowleader.comLike\">tom.zillich@surreynowleader.comLike</email> us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram and follow Tom on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLEAD-4054499</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLEAD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y9-T2B1-F103-31FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Surrey Now Leader</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 28, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Business &amp;

We have no details as of yet of what is being sent as part of those agreements.\"</p><p>Alberta Wildfire tweeted Tuesday that 45 crew members would be dispatched to Oregon this week, but it wasn't clear whether they were part of the national contingent. </p><p>The 60 firefighters and three supervisors who arrived in California two weeks ago to help battle the North Complex cluster of fires have been sent home to Quebec, but only a single crew of 20 will relieve them, U.S. Forest Service officials say. </p><p>Instead, the focus has shifted one state north to Oregon, where gusting winds and low humidity Wednesday urged on blazes that have so far killed at least eight people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and scorched more than 4,000 square kilometres.</p><p>Smoke from what officials and political leaders say is the worst wildfire season in recent memory blankets the continent, reaching as far away as Washington, D.C., and fouling air quality across southern Canada as it drifts east towards Europe.</p><p>The crisis is also taxing available resources at a time when the region's fire season is only half over and the COVID-19 pandemic has exerted unprecedented pressure on governments, agencies and families. Existing interstate and international agreements for sharing fire suppression resources are reportedly maxed out. </p><p>The crisis has also reached the presidential campaign trail: Democratic nominee Joe Biden is blaming climate change and accusing Donald Trump of ignoring the threat, while the president prefers to accuse states of failing to properly manage their forests. </p><p>Climate change was also resonating Wednesday on the other side of the country, where the slow-moving hurricane Sally made landfall in Alabama, battering the coastline with torrential rains, damaging winds and a devastating storm surge. </p><p>\"The impacts of climate change are on the doorsteps everywhere, no matter where you live in the United States,\" said Melinda Pierce, the Sierra Club's legislative director in Washington. </p><p>That, Pierce said, is turning the environment \u23e4 long an issue that was forced to take a back seat to more pressing pocketbook concerns \u23e4 into an economic imperative that neither political leaders nor voters can afford to ignore.</p><p>\"You are seeing historic and destructive wildfires, intense and frequent hurricanes in the Gulf, flooding in the Midwest, drought impacting farmers \u23e4 there is no area of the country that isn't seeing some impact from a changing climate.\" </p><p>Biden seized the chance this week to take the climate-crisis fight to Trump, calling him a \"climate arsonist\" whose re-election would only result in worsening floods, fires and droughts across the country. </p><p>Biden has promised to spend an eye-bulging $2 trillion over the next four years on clean energy projects and efforts to stop power plants from producing planet-warming carbon emissions.</p><p>By contrast, in a briefing Monday with state officials in California, the president shrugged off efforts to convince him of the science behind climate change, saying, \"I don't think science knows, actually.\"</p><p>Kamala Harris, Biden's vice-presidential running mate, toured what she described as the \"utterly predictable\" aftermath of the California fires on Tuesday in her first visit to her home state since the crisis began. </p><p>\"This is not a partisan issue,\" Harris said, standing alongside Gov. Gavin Newsom.</p><p>\"It is incumbent upon us, in terms of the leadership of our nation, to take seriously the extreme changes in our climate, and to do what we can to mitigate against the damage.\" </p><p>Newsom has for months been framing the situation in California, which recorded record-setting 54 C temperatures last month, as an early warning for the rest of the country and the world. </p><p>\"It's snowing ashes,\" he said. \"The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier.

But authorities know from experience that the biggest risks will come with repeated rains over many months or years while the damaged watersheds, or catchment areas, recover.</p><p>And because of the size and intensity of the fires, the potential effects are not clear yet.</p><p>\"The forest area burned in Australia within a single fire season is just staggering,\" said Stefan Doerr, a professor at Swansea University in England who studies the effects of forest fires on sediment and ash runoff. \"We haven't seen anything like it in recorded history.\"</p><p>The situation in Australia illustrates a growing global concern: Forests, grasslands and other areas that supply drinking water to hundreds of millions of people are increasingly vulnerable to fire due in large part to hotter, drier weather that has extended fire seasons, and more people moving into those areas, where they can accidentally set fires.</p><p>More than 60 per cent of the water supply for the world's 100 largest cities originates in fire-prone watersheds - and countless smaller communities also rely on surface water in vulnerable areas, researchers say.</p><p>When rain does fall, it can be intense, dumping a lot of water in a short period of time, which can quickly erode denuded slopes and wash huge volumes of ash, sediment and debris into crucial waterways and reservoirs. Besides reducing the amount of water available, the runoff also can introduce pollutants, as well as nutrients that create algae blooms.</p><p>What's more, the area that burns each year in many forest ecosystems has increased in recent decades, and that expansion will probably continue through the century because of a warmer climate, experts say.</p><p>Some scientists believe that high temperatures, drought and more frequent fires may make it impossible for some areas to be fully restored.</p><p>Very hot fires burn organic matter and topsoil needed for trees and other vegetation to regenerate, leaving nothing to absorb water. The heat also can seal and harden the ground, causing water to run off quickly, carrying everything in its path.</p><p>That in turn can clog streams, killing fish, plants and other aquatic life necessary for high-quality water before it reaches reservoirs. Already, thunderstorms in southeast Australia in recent weeks have caused debris flows and fish kills in some rivers, though fires continue to burn.</p><p>\"You potentially get this feedback cycle,\" where vegetation can't recolonize an area, which intensifies erosion of any remaining soil, said Joel Sankey, a research geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey</p><p>Climate change has affected areas such as northern Canada and Alaska, where average annual temperatures have risen by almost 2.2 C since the 1960s. As a result, the forested area burned annually has more than doubled over the past 20 to 30 years, Doerr said.</p><p>Although there might be fewer cities and towns in the path of runoff in those areas, problems do occur.</p><p>In Fort McMurray, Alta., the cost of treating ash-tainted water in its drinking-water system increased dramatically after a 2016 wildfire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020020157073658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3W-V7J1-DY91-K373-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DRQJ</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001817</classCode><className>WATER QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

I was in British Columbia in 2017 and the Australians were helping out.\"</p><p>The interagency centre, a Winnipeg-based non-profit entity run by federal, provincial and territorial fire management agencies, has said Australian firefighters helped out in Canada in 2015, 2017 and 2018.</p><p>The island country is suffering a lengthy and deadly wildfire season that began in October - several months earlier than usual.</p><p>More than seven million hectares across the country have burned.

I was in British Columbia in 2017 and the Australians were helping out.\"</p><p>The interagency centre, a Winnipeg-based non-profit entity run by federal, provincial and territorial fire management agencies, has said Australian firefighters helped out in Canada in 2015, 2017 and 2018.</p><p>The island country is suffering a lengthy and deadly wildfire season that began in October - several months earlier than usual.</p><p>More than seven million hectares across the country have burned. Twenty-eight people have died, more than 3,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed and the blazes have forced the largest peacetime evacuation in Australia's history.</p><p>It's estimated more than half a billion animals have died.</p><p>Smoke in Melbourne was so bad Tuesday that Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard needed medical attention in a qualifying match at the Australian Open tennis tournament.

When this tree first germinated and began to grow in full sunlight after the area was burnt in about 1515, it was about then that the early explorer from Spain, Ferdinand Magellan, sailed around the world for the very first time in 1520,\" he said.</p><p>Ultimately, the timeline is able to contextualize time and history through rings on a tree.</p><p>From a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami off of Vancouver Island in 1700, to the second smallpox outbreak of 1862 that devastated Island Indigenous people, the five centuries-old tree lived through a lot of change.</p><p>The Douglas fir slab and historical timeline can be found at the kiosk located along the walking trails of the Heritage Forest.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cloe.logan@pqbnews.com\">cloe.logan@pqbnews.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PARKQB-3982292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PARKQB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMD-W221-JDH1-C07K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438316</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Parksville Qualicum Beach</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N67891011</classCode><className>CHRONOLOGIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001486</classCode><className>RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001455</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A2W7</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001486</classCode><className>RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But neither got any attention from Trump himself, who showed up in person at the party's roll-call event in Charlotte, N.C., after delegates from across the country confirmed him as the GOP nominee.</p><p>\"We have to win - this is the most important election in the history of our country,\" Trump said during a rambling, off-the-cuff speech loaded with the usual attacks on Joe Biden and the Democrats, whom he accused of manufacturing a controversy over the U.S. Postal Service and mail-in voting.</p><p>\"This is it: our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction, or in an even greater direction.\"</p><p>The next several days, in which the spotlight-seeking Trump is expected to factor prominently, likely won't make much mention of climate change. But when the subject does come up, take it with a grain of salt, warned Elizabeth Gore, the senior vice-president of political affairs for Washington-based EDF Action, the advocacy wing of the Environmental Defense Fund.</p><p>\"It will be interesting to see if this administration tries to take any credit for anything on the environmental agenda at a time when it is working so hard against efforts to have cleaner air and cleaner water and a livable planet,\" Gore said in an interview.</p><p>\"That's going to be a false narrative that a group like EDF Action is going to be pushing hard against, because this administration has been nothing but harmful to the regulatory underpinnings for environmental protection, and has been nothing but counterproductive to interests across the country in addressing our climate change crisis.\"</p><p>The issue was front and centre during last week's largely online Democratic convention, which featured a brief but powerful video segment from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, recorded not far from one of the hundreds of wildfires burning out of control throughout the state.</p><p>\"If you are in denial about climate change, come to California,\" said Newsom, noting the 54 C temperatures recorded in Death Valley - believed to be a global record.</p><p>In his closing speech, Biden promised that if elected, his administration would make the most of what he called \"not only a crisis,\" but \"an enormous opportunity\" to be a world leader in clean energy, with millions of new jobs.</p><p>\"And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes and the president's $1.3-trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest one per cent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which pay no tax at all.\"</p><p>Newsom has already appealed directly to Canada and Australia for help in battling the wildfires, which have killed seven people, consumed more than half a million hectares and forced more than 100,000 residents from their homes. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which handles international resource requests, is canvassing member agencies for available resources, said spokesman Marc Mousseau.</p><p>On the other side of the country, meanwhile, two tropical storms are poised to drench U.S. states like Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama - with one of them expected to reach hurricane strength by the time it makes landfall later this week.</p><p>Tropical storm Marco, which weakened overnight Sunday, is expected to travel west as it skirts the edge of the Gulf Coast, while the storm known as Laura could be a category-2 hurricane by the time it reaches the U.S. That is expected Wednesday, the day before Trump takes the stage on the south lawn of the White House for the convention's big finale.</p><p>It likely won't matter whether Republicans want to talk about the impact of carbon emissions on the environment, said Gore, because the polls she's seen would suggest Americans - Democrat and Republican alike - do.  </p><p>\"Just looking at what voters say, and what's happening on Capitol Hill, the Republican message at the convention about climate - which sounds as though it's going to be firmly in the camp of denial or calling climate action 'extremism' - that is really out of step with most Americans, and even with most Republicans,\" she said. </p><p>\"The juxtaposition between this position that the Republican party is taking, particularly in the face of the two hurricanes and the wildfires in the West, is particularly striking, and emphasizes how out of step they are with what people across the political spectrum are really demanding from the government.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 24, 2020.</p><p>- With files from Jim Bronskill in Ottawa;

With the rise of post-truth politics in the U.S. and around the world, peddled by wildly dishonest figures like former U.S. president Donald Trump, I wanted to see how Canadian politicians compare, one leader at a time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up was Annamie Paul, leader of the Green party, who has been campaigning hard to win her seat in Toronto Centre while promoting an ambitious climate and social spending plan in the hopes of overcoming the party infighting that has defined her tenure so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, I watched every word of her press conferences, tuned into her radio and TV appearances, and kept tabs on her social media, all while fact-checking every single claim she made. In the process, I got a crash course on constitutional law, learned more about Canada's (frankly, dismal) global record on climate change, and gained insight into the challenges and opportunities associated with shifting to a greener economy.</p><p>Overall, Paul was honest. Her numbers and claims - related to Canada's climate record, the toll of COVID-19 in long-term care, and the scope of the opioid crisis - largely checked out.</p><p>The most notable exception came Monday, when Paul called for an \"emergency recall\" of Parliament to debate the crisis in Afghanistan, citing Section 46.3 of the federal Emergencies Act. Constitutional experts were quick to say that Section 46.3 didn't exist - Paul later clarified she meant Section 58.3, which does exist but doesn't apply - and that recalling Parliament after it had already been dissolved was impossible.</p><p>\"Once Parliament is dissolved, MPs lose their status as MPs and Parliament ceases to exist until it is reconstituted by the election,\" Emmett Macfarlane, professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, told me.</p><p>The day after Torstar published my fact check, Paul backtracked somewhat. She acknowledged that recalling Parliament is not possible and noted that the Emergencies Act doesn't apply, but argued this fact demands attention. \"If this is not the way to do it, if there are alternatives, then now is the time that we step forward and talk about what they are,\" she said.</p><p>And that's fair enough.</p><p>Paul had a few other blips. Her claim that greenhouse gas emissions have gone up every year Justin Trudeau's Liberals have been in power is a popular talking point of hers, but it ignores that Canada's emissions dropped in 2016, the first full year of Trudeau's mandate - and that year clearly counts as part of the prime minister's record.</p><p>Nevertheless, Paul's first week of campaigning was broadly in line with reality. In total, I found four false claims in 184 minutes of public appearances. I also deemed four separate claims (one of which she repeated) to be a stretch, meaning the claim was broadly true, but not in the specific context in which Paul said it.</p><p>That works out to a \"dishonesty density\" of about one false claim every 47 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said.</p><p>As I continue on to fact-check NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh next week, followed by Conservative Erin O'Toole and Liberal Justin Trudeau, this is the measure I'll use to compare the leaders.</p><p>(And no, Paul's \"dishonesty density\" last week was nowhere close to Trump's.)</p><p>Here's a selection of Paul's claims this week:</p><p>\"Whatever we do now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... we are going to arrive at 1.5 degrees Celsius (warming) and there is no way that we can avoid that.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warns it is all but inevitable that we will blow past the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 C warming.</p><p>\"We normally have a forest fire season but we have never seen one this bad.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>A stretch: Paul later clarified that her statement was a qualitative one referring to the impact of this year's forest fires on communities. Still, although the 2021 wildfire season has been well worse than the recent average, it has caused extreme damage and is still ongoing, it's at least a stretch to say we've never seen one this bad. Several fire seasons in the record have had more fires and a larger area burned than 2021 so far, and other years have seen more acute damage in terms of cost and homes destroyed - for instance, the 2016 Fort McMurray fire, Canada's costliest recent natural disaster.</p><p>Nevertheless, 2021 \"has been a highly damaging fire season,\" said fire ecologist Robert Gray, citing the several lost communities, two civilian deaths in B.C. plus a pilot killed in Alberta, the large area burned, and significant smoke impacts on populated areas, among other things. \"More importantly,\" he said, \"it is a portend of things to come.\"</p><p>\"Canada has never hit one of its greenhouse gas emissions targets in the six years of the current government.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: Not only has Canada not hit a single climate target under the Trudeau Liberals, we've never hit one period. Canada exceeded its Rio, 1992, target by 20 per cent; missed the Kyoto, 1997, commitment by 25 per cent; and although data for the Copenhagen, 2009, target year of 2020 is not yet available, Canada's emissions were already well higher in 2019, said Caroline Brouillette, domestic policy manager for Climate Action Network Canada.</p><p>\"GHG emissions have gone up every year during (the Liberals') mandate, and we are now one of the top 5 worst GHG emitters/capita in the world.\" - Aug. 16, on Twitter</p><p>False: Canada's greenhouse gas emissions fell in 2016, the first full year of the Trudeau Liberals' mandate, from 723 megatonnes of CO2 to 707 megatonnes.</p><p>They have risen each year since then, but that first year counts. The second part of this statement is true - among larger-population countries, Canada ranks third-highest in per capita CO2 emissions.</p><p>\"We are just being left further and further behind as other countries in the G7 and other wealthy countries move ahead at a pace that is just far beyond anything that we've planned so far.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>True: Canada's recent climate record is the worst in the G7. From 2016 to 2019, Canada's emissions increased by 3.3 per cent, far above the U.S.'s 0.6 per cent growth over the same period. Meanwhile, the other five G7 countries decreased their greenhouse gas emissions by between 4.4 per cent and 10.8 per cent.</p><p>\"The jobs in the green economy, many of them (go directly to) people in the fossil fuel sector. They don't need years of retraining, the jobs pay more money.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>A stretch: Experts say Paul's comment that switching to a green job does not require much training is misleading. It may be relatively easy for a driver of an internal combustion engine bus to switch to driving an electric bus, for example, but transitioning from working on an oil rig to installing energy-efficient windows will inevitably require new skills, said Sarah Petrevan, policy director for Clean Energy Canada.</p><p>Furthermore, jobs in the clean technology sector pay better than most - but they're not more lucrative than jobs in the fossil fuel sector on average. According to Statistics Canada, jobs in the clean technology sector paid an average of $75,816 in 2019 (above the national average of just over $56,783), while oil and gas workers earned an average of $161,230 and coal workers earned $104,930.

With the rise of post-truth politics in the U.S. and around the world, peddled by wildly dishonest figures like former U.S. president Donald Trump, I wanted to see how Canadian politicians compare, one leader at a time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up was Annamie Paul, leader of the Green party, who has been campaigning hard to win her seat in Toronto Centre while promoting an ambitious climate and social spending plan in the hopes of overcoming the party infighting that has defined her tenure so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, I watched every word of her press conferences, tuned into her radio and TV appearances, and kept tabs on her social media, all while fact-checking every single claim she made. In the process, I got a crash course on constitutional law, learned more about Canada's (frankly, dismal) global record on climate change, and gained insight into the challenges and opportunities associated with shifting to a greener economy.</p><p>Overall, Paul was honest. Her numbers and claims - related to Canada's climate record, the toll of COVID-19 in long-term care, and the scope of the opioid crisis - largely checked out.</p><p>The most notable exception came Monday, when Paul called for an \"emergency recall\" of Parliament to debate the crisis in Afghanistan, citing Section 46.3 of the federal Emergencies Act. Constitutional experts were quick to say that Section 46.3 didn't exist - Paul later clarified she meant Section 58.3, which does exist but doesn't apply - and that recalling Parliament after it had already been dissolved was impossible.</p><p>\"Once Parliament is dissolved, MPs lose their status as MPs and Parliament ceases to exist until it is reconstituted by the election,\" Emmett Macfarlane, professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, told me.</p><p>The day after Torstar published my fact check, Paul backtracked somewhat. She acknowledged that recalling Parliament is not possible and noted that the Emergencies Act doesn't apply, but argued this fact demands attention. \"If this is not the way to do it, if there are alternatives, then now is the time that we step forward and talk about what they are,\" she said.</p><p>And that's fair enough.</p><p>Paul had a few other blips. Her claim that greenhouse gas emissions have gone up every year Justin Trudeau's Liberals have been in power is a popular talking point of hers, but it ignores that Canada's emissions dropped in 2016, the first full year of Trudeau's mandate - and that year clearly counts as part of the prime minister's record.</p><p>Nevertheless, Paul's first week of campaigning was broadly in line with reality. In total, I found four false claims in 184 minutes of public appearances. I also deemed four separate claims (one of which she repeated) to be a stretch, meaning the claim was broadly true, but not in the specific context in which Paul said it.</p><p>That works out to a \"dishonesty density\" of about one false claim every 47 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said.</p><p>As I continue on to fact-check NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh next week, followed by Conservative Erin O'Toole and Liberal Justin Trudeau, this is the measure I'll use to compare the leaders.</p><p>(And no, Paul's \"dishonesty density\" last week was nowhere close to Trump's.)</p><p>Here's a selection of Paul's claims this week:</p><p>\"Whatever we do now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... we are going to arrive at 1.5 degrees Celsius (warming) and there is no way that we can avoid that.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warns it is all but inevitable that we will blow past the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 C warming.</p><p>\"We normally have a forest fire season but we have never seen one this bad.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>A stretch: Paul later clarified that her statement was a qualitative one referring to the impact of this year's forest fires on communities. Still, although the 2021 wildfire season has been well worse than the recent average, it has caused extreme damage and is still ongoing, it's at least a stretch to say we've never seen one this bad. Several fire seasons in the record have had more fires and a larger area burned than 2021 so far, and other years have seen more acute damage in terms of cost and homes destroyed - for instance, the 2016 Fort McMurray fire, Canada's costliest recent natural disaster.</p><p>Nevertheless, 2021 \"has been a highly damaging fire season,\" said fire ecologist Robert Gray, citing the several lost communities, two civilian deaths in B.C. plus a pilot killed in Alberta, the large area burned, and significant smoke impacts on populated areas, among other things. \"More importantly,\" he said, \"it is a portend of things to come.\"</p><p>\"Canada has never hit one of its greenhouse gas emissions targets in the six years of the current government.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: Not only has Canada not hit a single climate target under the Trudeau Liberals, we've never hit one period. Canada exceeded its Rio, 1992, target by 20 per cent; missed the Kyoto, 1997, commitment by 25 per cent; and although data for the Copenhagen, 2009, target year of 2020 is not yet available, Canada's emissions were already well higher in 2019, said Caroline Brouillette, domestic policy manager for Climate Action Network Canada.</p><p>\"GHG emissions have gone up every year during (the Liberals') mandate, and we are now one of the top 5 worst GHG emitters/capita in the world.\" - Aug. 16, on Twitter</p><p>False: Canada's greenhouse gas emissions fell in 2016, the first full year of the Trudeau Liberals' mandate, from 723 megatonnes of CO2 to 707 megatonnes.</p><p>They have risen each year since then, but that first year counts. The second part of this statement is true - among larger-population countries, Canada ranks third-highest in per capita CO2 emissions.</p><p>\"We are just being left further and further behind as other countries in the G7 and other wealthy countries move ahead at a pace that is just far beyond anything that we've planned so far.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>True: Canada's recent climate record is the worst in the G7. From 2016 to 2019, Canada's emissions increased by 3.3 per cent, far above the U.S.'s 0.6 per cent growth over the same period. Meanwhile, the other five G7 countries decreased their greenhouse gas emissions by between 4.4 per cent and 10.8 per cent.</p><p>\"The jobs in the green economy, many of them (go directly to) people in the fossil fuel sector. They don't need years of retraining, the jobs pay more money.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>A stretch: Experts say Paul's comment that switching to a green job does not require much training is misleading. It may be relatively easy for a driver of an internal combustion engine bus to switch to driving an electric bus, for example, but transitioning from working on an oil rig to installing energy-efficient windows will inevitably require new skills, said Sarah Petrevan, policy director for Clean Energy Canada.</p><p>Furthermore, jobs in the clean technology sector pay better than most - but they're not more lucrative than jobs in the fossil fuel sector on average.

Anyone who lights a fire must comply with B.C.'s air quality control legislation. The BC Wildfire Service urges people to take the following precautions with any permitted outdoor burning:</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Ensure that enough people, water and tools are on hand to control the fire and stop it from escaping.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Do not burn in windy conditions. The weather can change quickly, and the wind may carry embers to other combustible material and start new fires.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Create a fireguard around the planned fire site by clearing away twigs, grass, leaves and other combustible material.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Never leave a fire unattended.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; Make sure that the fire is fully extinguished, and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area for any length of time.</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; These prohibitions apply to all public and private land, unless specified otherwise (e.g. in a local government bylaw). Please check with local government authorities for any other restrictions before lighting any fire.</p><p>Enforcement</p><p>Enforcement of fire prohibitions is undertaken by:</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; the Compliance and Enforcement Branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development;</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; the Conservation Officer Service; and</p><p>&amp;#x26;#8226; the RCMP.</p><p>All illegal fires will be investigated, and charges may be laid under the Wildfire Act or Wildfire</p><p>Regulation, depending on the outcome of the investigation.</p><p>Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a ticket for</p><p>$1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court,</p><p>fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs, as well as the value of resources damaged or destroyed by the wildfire.</p><p>The Cariboo Fire Centre stretches from Loon Lake near Clinton in the south to the Cottonwood River near Quesnel in the north, and from Tweedsmuir Provincial Park in the west to Wells Gray Provincial Park in the east.</p><p>To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.</p><p>For the latest information on current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, road closures and air quality advisories, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bcwildfire.ca\">www.bcwildfire.ca</url>.</p><p>Do you have a comment about this story? email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@wltribune.comLike\">editor@wltribune.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-4006689</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607X-HDN1-JDH1-C4Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Williams Lake Tribune Advisor</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN62</classCode><className>FIREWORKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

With the rise of post-truth politics in the U.S. and around the world, peddled by wildly dishonest figures like former U.S. president Donald Trump, I wanted to see how Canadian politicians compare, one leader at a time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up was Annamie Paul, leader of the Green party, who has been campaigning hard to win her seat in Toronto Centre while promoting an ambitious climate and social spending plan in the hopes of overcoming the party infighting that has defined her tenure so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, I watched every word of her press conferences, tuned into her radio and TV appearances, and kept tabs on her social media, all while fact-checking every single claim she made. In the process, I got a crash course on constitutional law, learned more about Canada's (frankly, dismal) global record on climate change, and gained insight into the challenges and opportunities associated with shifting to a greener economy.</p><p>Overall, Paul was honest. Her numbers and claims - related to Canada's climate record, the toll of COVID-19 in long-term care, and the scope of the opioid crisis - largely checked out.</p><p>The most notable exception came Monday, when Paul called for an \"emergency recall\" of Parliament to debate the crisis in Afghanistan, citing Section 46.3 of the federal Emergencies Act. Constitutional experts were quick to say that Section 46.3 didn't exist - Paul later clarified she meant Section 58.3, which does exist but doesn't apply - and that recalling Parliament after it had already been dissolved was impossible.</p><p>\"Once Parliament is dissolved, MPs lose their status as MPs and Parliament ceases to exist until it is reconstituted by the election,\" Emmett Macfarlane, professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, told me.</p><p>The day after Torstar published my fact check, Paul backtracked somewhat. She acknowledged that recalling Parliament is not possible and noted that the Emergencies Act doesn't apply, but argued this fact demands attention. \"If this is not the way to do it, if there are alternatives, then now is the time that we step forward and talk about what they are,\" she said.</p><p>And that's fair enough.</p><p>Paul had a few other blips. Her claim that greenhouse gas emissions have gone up every year Justin Trudeau's Liberals have been in power is a popular talking point of hers, but it ignores that Canada's emissions dropped in 2016, the first full year of Trudeau's mandate - and that year clearly counts as part of the prime minister's record.</p><p>Nevertheless, Paul's first week of campaigning was broadly in line with reality. In total, I found four false claims in 184 minutes of public appearances. I also deemed four separate claims (one of which she repeated) to be a stretch, meaning the claim was broadly true, but not in the specific context in which Paul said it.</p><p>That works out to a \"dishonesty density\" of about one false claim every 47 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said.</p><p>As I continue on to fact-check NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh next week, followed by Conservative Erin O'Toole and Liberal Justin Trudeau, this is the measure I'll use to compare the leaders.</p><p>(And no, Paul's \"dishonesty density\" last week was nowhere close to Trump's.)</p><p>Here's a selection of Paul's claims this week:</p><p>\"Whatever we do now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... we are going to arrive at 1.5 degrees Celsius (warming) and there is no way that we can avoid that.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warns it is all but inevitable that we will blow past the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 C warming.</p><p>\"We normally have a forest fire season but we have never seen one this bad.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>A stretch: Paul later clarified that her statement was a qualitative one referring to the impact of this year's forest fires on communities. Still, although the 2021 wildfire season has been well worse than the recent average, it has caused extreme damage and is still ongoing, it's at least a stretch to say we've never seen one this bad. Several fire seasons in the record have had more fires and a larger area burned than 2021 so far, and other years have seen more acute damage in terms of cost and homes destroyed - for instance, the 2016 Fort McMurray fire, Canada's costliest recent natural disaster.</p><p>Nevertheless, 2021 \"has been a highly damaging fire season,\" said fire ecologist Robert Gray, citing the several lost communities, two civilian deaths in B.C. plus a pilot killed in Alberta, the large area burned, and significant smoke impacts on populated areas, among other things. \"More importantly,\" he said, \"it is a portend of things to come.\"</p><p>\"Canada has never hit one of its greenhouse gas emissions targets in the six years of the current government.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: Not only has Canada not hit a single climate target under the Trudeau Liberals, we've never hit one period. Canada exceeded its Rio, 1992, target by 20 per cent; missed the Kyoto, 1997, commitment by 25 per cent; and although data for the Copenhagen, 2009, target year of 2020 is not yet available, Canada's emissions were already well higher in 2019, said Caroline Brouillette, domestic policy manager for Climate Action Network Canada.</p><p>\"GHG emissions have gone up every year during (the Liberals') mandate, and we are now one of the top 5 worst GHG emitters/capita in the world.\" - Aug. 16, on Twitter</p><p>False: Canada's greenhouse gas emissions fell in 2016, the first full year of the Trudeau Liberals' mandate, from 723 megatonnes of CO2 to 707 megatonnes.</p><p>They have risen each year since then, but that first year counts. The second part of this statement is true - among larger-population countries, Canada ranks third-highest in per capita CO2 emissions.</p><p>\"We are just being left further and further behind as other countries in the G7 and other wealthy countries move ahead at a pace that is just far beyond anything that we've planned so far.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>True: Canada's recent climate record is the worst in the G7. From 2016 to 2019, Canada's emissions increased by 3.3 per cent, far above the U.S.'s 0.6 per cent growth over the same period. Meanwhile, the other five G7 countries decreased their greenhouse gas emissions by between 4.4 per cent and 10.8 per cent.</p><p>\"The jobs in the green economy, many of them (go directly to) people in the fossil fuel sector. They don't need years of retraining, the jobs pay more money.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>A stretch: Experts say Paul's comment that switching to a green job does not require much training is misleading. It may be relatively easy for a driver of an internal combustion engine bus to switch to driving an electric bus, for example, but transitioning from working on an oil rig to installing energy-efficient windows will inevitably require new skills, said Sarah Petrevan, policy director for Clean Energy Canada.</p><p>Furthermore, jobs in the clean technology sector pay better than most - but they're not more lucrative than jobs in the fossil fuel sector on average. According to Statistics Canada, jobs in the clean technology sector paid an average of $75,816 in 2019 (above the national average of just over $56,783), while oil and gas workers earned an average of $161,230 and coal workers earned $104,930. (Statistics Canada advised the average salary data may not be directly comparable among industries, but the data still provides a window into the earning power of each of the sectors.)</p><p>\"Over 15,000 deaths in long-term care. The worst record amongst wealthy nations by far.\" - Aug. 18, in Toronto</p><p>True: More than 15,000 residents and 30 staff have died from COVID-19 in Canada's long-term-care system. A March 2021 report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found Canada has the worst record for COVID-19 deaths in long-term-care homes compared with other wealthy countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-news20210824TNI2021082462008715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63FF-3SY1-F197-5070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Her numbers and claims - related to Canada's climate record, the toll of COVID-19 in long-term care, and the scope of the opioid crisis - largely checked out.</p><p>The most notable exception came Monday, when Paul called for an \"emergency recall\" of Parliament to debate the crisis in Afghanistan, citing Section 46.3 of the federal Emergencies Act. Constitutional experts were quick to say that Section 46.3 didn't exist - Paul later clarified she meant Section 58.3, which does exist but doesn't apply - and that recalling Parliament after it had already been dissolved was impossible.</p><p>\"Once Parliament is dissolved, MPs lose their status as MPs and Parliament ceases to exist until it is reconstituted by the election,\" Emmett Macfarlane, professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, told me.</p><p>The day after Torstar published my fact check, Paul backtracked somewhat. She acknowledged that recalling Parliament is not possible and noted that the Emergencies Act doesn't apply, but argued this fact demands attention. \"If this is not the way to do it, if there are alternatives, then now is the time that we step forward and talk about what they are,\" she said.</p><p>And that's fair enough.</p><p>Paul had a few other blips. Her claim that greenhouse gas emissions have gone up every year Justin Trudeau's Liberals have been in power is a popular talking point of hers, but it ignores that Canada's emissions dropped in 2016, the first full year of Trudeau's mandate - and that year clearly counts as part of the prime minister's record.</p><p>Nevertheless, Paul's first week of campaigning was broadly in line with reality. In total, I found four false claims in 184 minutes of public appearances. I also deemed four separate claims (one of which she repeated) to be a stretch, meaning the claim was broadly true, but not in the specific context in which Paul said it.</p><p>That works out to a \"dishonesty density\" of about one false claim every 47 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said.</p><p>As I continue on to fact-check NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh next week, followed by Conservative Erin O'Toole and Liberal Justin Trudeau, this is the measure I'll use to compare the leaders.</p><p>(And no, Paul's \"dishonesty density\" last week was nowhere close to Trump's.)</p><p>Here's a selection of Paul's claims this week:</p><p>\"Whatever we do now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... we are going to arrive at 1.5 degrees Celsius (warming) and there is no way that we can avoid that.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warns it is all but inevitable that we will blow past the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 C warming.</p><p>\"We normally have a forest fire season but we have never seen one this bad.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>A stretch: Paul later clarified that her statement was a qualitative one referring to the impact of this year's forest fires on communities. Still, although the 2021 wildfire season has been well worse than the recent average, it has caused extreme damage and is still ongoing, it's at least a stretch to say we've never seen one this bad. Several fire seasons in the record have had more fires and a larger area burned than 2021 so far, and other years have seen more acute damage in terms of cost and homes destroyed - for instance, the 2016 Fort McMurray fire, Canada's costliest recent natural disaster.</p><p>Nevertheless, 2021 \"has been a highly damaging fire season,\" said fire ecologist Robert Gray, citing the several lost communities, two civilian deaths in B.C. plus a pilot killed in Alberta, the large area burned, and significant smoke impacts on populated areas, among other things. \"More importantly,\" he said, \"it is a portend of things to come.\"</p><p>\"Canada has never hit one of its greenhouse gas emissions targets in the six years of the current government.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: Not only has Canada not hit a single climate target under the Trudeau Liberals, we've never hit one period. Canada exceeded its Rio, 1992, target by 20 per cent; missed the Kyoto, 1997, commitment by 25 per cent; and although data for the Copenhagen, 2009, target year of 2020 is not yet available, Canada's emissions were already well higher in 2019, said Caroline Brouillette, domestic policy manager for Climate Action Network Canada.</p><p>\"GHG emissions have gone up every year during (the Liberals') mandate, and we are now one of the top 5 worst GHG emitters/capita in the world.\" - Aug. 16, on Twitter</p><p>False: Canada's greenhouse gas emissions fell in 2016, the first full year of the Trudeau Liberals' mandate, from 723 megatonnes of CO2 to 707 megatonnes.</p><p>They have risen each year since then, but that first year counts. The second part of this statement is true - among larger-population countries, Canada ranks third-highest in per capita CO2 emissions.</p><p>\"We are just being left further and further behind as other countries in the G7 and other wealthy countries move ahead at a pace that is just far beyond anything that we've planned so far.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>True: Canada's recent climate record is the worst in the G7. From 2016 to 2019, Canada's emissions increased by 3.3 per cent, far above the U.S.'s 0.6 per cent growth over the same period. Meanwhile, the other five G7 countries decreased their greenhouse gas emissions by between 4.4 per cent and 10.8 per cent.</p><p>\"The jobs in the green economy, many of them (go directly to) people in the fossil fuel sector. They don't need years of retraining, the jobs pay more money.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>A stretch: Experts say Paul's comment that switching to a green job does not require much training is misleading. It may be relatively easy for a driver of an internal combustion engine bus to switch to driving an electric bus, for example, but transitioning from working on an oil rig to installing energy-efficient windows will inevitably require new skills, said Sarah Petrevan, policy director for Clean Energy Canada.</p><p>Furthermore, jobs in the clean technology sector pay better than most - but they're not more lucrative than jobs in the fossil fuel sector on average. According to Statistics Canada, jobs in the clean technology sector paid an average of $75,816 in 2019 (above the national average of just over $56,783), while oil and gas workers earned an average of $161,230 and coal workers earned $104,930. (Statistics Canada advised the average salary data may not be directly comparable among industries, but the data still provides a window into the earning power of each of the sectors.)</p><p>\"Over 15,000 deaths in long-term care. The worst record amongst wealthy nations by far.\" - Aug. 18, in Toronto</p><p>True: More than 15,000 residents and 30 staff have died from COVID-19 in Canada's long-term-care system. A March 2021 report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found Canada has the worst record for COVID-19 deaths in long-term-care homes compared with other wealthy countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-news20210824THS2021082462009163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63FF-3SY1-F197-5051-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

With the rise of post-truth politics in the U.S. and around the world, peddled by wildly dishonest figures like former U.S. president Donald Trump, I wanted to see how Canadian politicians compare, one leader at a time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up was Annamie Paul, leader of the Green party, who has been campaigning hard to win her seat in Toronto Centre while promoting an ambitious climate and social spending plan in the hopes of overcoming the party infighting that has defined her tenure so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, I watched every word of her press conferences, tuned into her radio and TV appearances, and kept tabs on her social media, all while fact-checking every single claim she made. In the process, I got a crash course on constitutional law, learned more about Canada's (frankly, dismal) global record on climate change, and gained insight into the challenges and opportunities associated with shifting to a greener economy.</p><p>Overall, Paul was honest. Her numbers and claims - related to Canada's climate record, the toll of COVID-19 in long-term care, and the scope of the opioid crisis - largely checked out.</p><p>The most notable exception came Monday, when Paul called for an \"emergency recall\" of Parliament to debate the crisis in Afghanistan, citing Section 46.3 of the federal Emergencies Act. Constitutional experts were quick to say that Section 46.3 didn't exist - Paul later clarified she meant Section 58.3, which does exist but doesn't apply - and that recalling Parliament after it had already been dissolved was impossible.</p><p>\"Once Parliament is dissolved, MPs lose their status as MPs and Parliament ceases to exist until it is reconstituted by the election,\" Emmett Macfarlane, professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, told me.</p><p>The day after the Star published my fact check, Paul backtracked somewhat. She acknowledged that recalling Parliament is not possible and noted that the Emergencies Act doesn't apply, but argued this fact demands attention. \"If this is not the way to do it, if there are alternatives, then now is the time that we step forward and talk about what they are,\" she said.</p><p>And that's fair enough.</p><p>Paul had a few other blips. Her claim that greenhouse gas emissions have gone up every year Justin Trudeau's Liberals have been in power is a popular talking point of hers, but it ignores that Canada's emissions dropped in 2016, the first full year of Trudeau's mandate - and that year clearly counts as part of the prime minister's record.</p><p>Nevertheless, Paul's first week of campaigning was broadly in line with reality. In total, I found four false claimsin 184 minutes of public appearances. I also deemed four separate claims (one of which she repeated) to be a stretch, meaning the claim was broadly true, but not in the specific context in which Paul said it.</p><p>That works out to a \"dishonesty density\" of about one false claim every 47 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said.</p><p>As I continue on to fact-check NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh next week, followed by Conservative Erin O'Toole and Liberal Justin Trudeau, this is the measure I'll use to compare the leaders.</p><p>(And no, Paul's \"dishonesty density\" last week was nowhere close to Trump's.)</p><p>Here's a selection of Paul's claims this week:</p><p>\"Whatever we do now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... we are going to arrive at 1.5 degrees Celsius (warming) and there is no way that we can avoid that.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warns it is all but inevitable that we will blow past the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 C warming.</p><p>\"We normally have a forest fire season but we have never seen one this bad.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>A stretch: Paul later clarified that her statement was a qualitative one referring to the impact of this year's forest fires on communities. Still, although the 2021 wildfire season has been well worse than the recent average, has caused extreme damage and is still ongoing, it's at least a stretch to say we've never seen one this bad. Several fire seasons in the record have had more fires and a larger area burned than 2021 so far, and other years have seen more acute damage in terms of cost and homes destroyed - for instance, the 2016 Fort McMurray fire, Canada's costliest recent natural disaster.</p><p>Nevertheless, 2021 \"has been a highly damaging fire season,\" said fire ecologist Robert Gray, citing the several lost communities, two civilian deaths in B.C. plus a pilot killed in Alberta, the large area burned, and significant smoke impacts on populated areas, among other things. \"More importantly,\" he said, \"it is a portend of things to come.\"</p><p>\"Canada has never hit one of its greenhouse gas emissions targets in the six years of the current government.\" - Aug. 16, in Toronto</p><p>True: Not only has Canada not hit a single climate target under the Trudeau Liberals, we've never hit one period. Canada exceeded its Rio, 1992, target by 20 per cent; missed the Kyoto, 1997, commitment by 25 per cent; and although data for the Copenhagen, 2009, target year of 2020 is not yet available, Canada's emissions were already well higher in 2019, said Caroline Brouillette, Domestic Policy Manager for Climate Action Network Canada.</p><p>\"GHG emissions have gone up every year during (the Liberals') mandate, and we are now one of the top 5 worst GHG emitters/capita in the world.\" - Aug. 16, on Twitter</p><p>False: Canada's greenhouse gas emissions fell in 2016, the first full year of the Trudeau Liberals' mandate, from 723 megatonnes of CO2 to 707 megatonnes. They have risen each year since then, but that first year counts. The second part of this statement is true - among larger-population countries, Canada ranks third-highest in per capita CO2 emissions.</p><p>\"We are just being left further and further behind as other countries in the G7 and other wealthy countries move ahead at a pace that is just far beyond anything that we've planned so far.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>True: Canada's recent climate record is the worst in the G7. From 2016 to 2019, Canada's emissions increased by 3.3 per cent, far above the U.S.'s 0.6 per cent growth over the same period. Meanwhile, the other five G7 countries decreased their greenhouse gas emissions by between 4.4 per cent and 10.8 per cent.</p><p>\"The jobs in the green economy, many of them (go directly to) people in the fossil fuel sector. They don't need years of re-training, the jobs pay more money.\" - Aug. 18, on the Rob Snow Show</p><p>A stretch: Experts say Paul's comment that switching to a green job does not require much training is misleading. It may be relatively easy for a driver of an internal combustion engine bus to switch to driving an electric bus, for example, but transitioning from working on an oil rig to installing energy-efficient windows will inevitably require new skills, said Sarah Petrevan, Policy Director for Clean Energy Canada.</p><p>Furthermore, jobs in the clean technology sector pay better than most - but they're not more lucrative than jobs in the fossil fuel sector on average. According to Statistics Canada, jobs in the clean technology sector paid an average of $75,816 in 2019 (above the national average of just over $56,783), while oil and gas workers earned an average of $161,230 and coal workers earned $104,930. (Statistics Canada advised the average salary data may not be directly comparable among industries, but the data still provides a window into the earning power of each of the sectors.)</p><p>\"Over 15,000 deaths in long-term care. The worst record amongst wealthy nations by far.\" - Aug. 18, in Toronto</p><p>True: More than 15,000 residents and 30 staff have died from COVID-19 in Canada's long-term-care system. A March 2021 report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found Canada has the worst record for COVID-19 deaths in long-term-care homes compared with other wealthy countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210823TTA2021082362003311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63F7-42V1-JDV5-F1WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

He took an early retirement in 2001 after his wife passed away from cancer in 1994 at the age of 42.</p><p>At the time of her death, Barton's son and daughter were teenagers, and several years later he came to the conclusion that \"life's too short\" not to enjoy it. But he was coaxed back by the mayor in 2008 after Nipissing carried out a study of its operations and decided it should have a chief administrative officer.</p><p>\"They wanted me to work full time, but I said no and we settled on three days a week,\" says Barton, 71.</p><p>Barton studied business administration at Canadore College when it was still a campus of Sudbury's Cambrian College before becoming an independent institution in 1972.</p><p>Born and raised in Nipissing Township and after graduating from college, Barton began working at the Bank of Nova Scotia's main branch in North Bay in 1971. He spent nine years as a Scotiabank employee and, during that time, he and his family moved eight times.</p><p>\"I liked working for the bank, but I didn't like moving all the time. And when the kids started to get into school, they didn't want to keep moving either,\" Barton recalls.</p><p>When he was growing up, Barton knew the type of work he wanted to do. He liked three careers, namely becoming a bank manager, a township clerk or a church minister.</p><p>He ended up in banking, and when the financial sector took him to Sault Ste. Marie, he played the organ at the church the Barton family attended. It was then he got a phone call from the then reeve of Nipissing.</p><p>Barton recalls the conversation.</p><p>\"He said 'The clerk's job in Nipissing is coming up, You better apply,'\" Barton recalls. \"I said 'OK,' applied and got the job. So I guess with me now finally retiring I won't become a minister.\"</p><p>LONE OFFICE EMPLOYEE</p><p>Barton first started at the township office on May 5, 1980, as the municipality's clerk, treasurer and tax collector.</p><p>At the time, he was the only office member, although the township had a roads superintendent who also was in charge of the landfill.</p><p>\"I looked after the office, cemetery and recreation,\" Barton recalls.</p><p>Since those early days in 1980, Barton has seen several major changes and he had input in bringing them about.</p><p>For example there was no zoning bylaw or official plan, which he helped create.</p><p>Also, there was no fire department. Several portable pumps are what the township used to fight fires.</p><p>Barton recalls one of the pumps was stationed at the township office, another was in Commanda Township, a third in Nipissing and one pump was in place for the island properties.</p><p>The former Ministry of Natural Resources would help Nipissing Township in the event of a forest fire. And if there was a structure fire too large for the community to fight on its own, Callander would send its firefighters.</p><p>Although a group of volunteers built the township's first fire department on Wasi Road, Barton says the community wouldn't see a full fire department until the late 1980s.</p><p>When Barton agreed to return in 2008, he assumed the roles of chief administrative officer and clerk, and a little later he was named deputy treasurer.</p><p>With Barton's latest departure, town council has named Kris Croskery-Hodgins the interim CAO-clerk-treasurer.</p><p>Prior to the appointment, Croskery-Hodgins was the treasurer and deputy clerk.</p><p>It was during Barton's second life with the township that the office personnel began to expand. He says Croskery-Hodgins was hired as was John-Paul Negrinotti, who looked after issues such as zoning bylaws, minor severances and variances in his role as the municipal planning official.</p><p>'LONG SUCCESSION PLAN'</p><p>Over the succeeding years, Barton trained both of the new employees calling what he was doing a \"long succession plan.</p><p>\"They're trained, ready to take over and it was time for me to retire,\" he says.</p><p>Over his two stints at the township hall, Barton worked with 13 town councils, speaking highly of the elected officials.</p><p>\"I never had a bad council in all those years,\" he says.</p><p>Barton says he enjoyed going to work every day over the decades, adding \"you never knew what was going to happen.\"</p><p>Nipissing Township has a core, year-round population of 1,700 people, but swells to more than 3,000 residents during tourist season. Barton says he could always expect a call of some sort almost daily.</p><p>Barton originally intended to retire last year, but when COVID-19 struck he agreed to stay on a little longer. But after that additional year, Barton says the time to leave is now.</p><p>Council, he says, is in the third year of a four-year term and he didn't want to leave during an election year or leave when the new council is elected.</p><p>\"That was at the back of my mind,\" he says.</p><p>\"But now with me gone, they can hire a new person who can be trained for next year's election.\"</p><p>'GOOD' RESERVES</p><p>Barton says he's leaving the township in excellent financial shape, adding \"our reserves are good.\" He most recently helped bring about a new official plan and last December the zoning bylaw was updated.</p><p>Barton personally hopes council sees its way to make Croskery-Hodgins the permanent chief administrative officer.</p><p>\"I hope council sees Kris would be the logical choice if they do advertise for a chief administrative officer,\" he says.</p><p>Barton lives on a 170-acre property and in the same home where he was born. His daughter lives next door to him in Nipissing and his son about one kilometre away.</p><p>He has four grandchildren, one great-grandchild and a female companion in the Burk's Falls area.</p><p>With his municipal career over, Barton says he now has more time for recreational activities like snowmobiling on his land, and come this summer he can golf on a nine-hole course he put on his land.</p><p>He also recently bought a piano.</p><p>\"So I have lots to do,\" he says.</p><p>Rocco Frangione is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the North Bay Nugget.

(\"LAURION\" or the \"Corporation\") is pleased to announce new drill hole assay results of the ongoing 2021 drilling program focussing on the strike continuity between the A-Zone and McLeod mineralized areas on the Ishkoday Property, located 220 km northeast of Thunder Bay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights of current drill hole results include: //st * 0.77 g/t Au, 4.31 g/t Ag, 0.83% Zn over 20m on hole LBX21-045 between 145 and 165m. * 0.71 g/t Au, 13.29 g/t Ag, 0.17% Cu and 2.22% Zn over 13.5m on hole LBX21-046 between 138.5 and 152 m (See Figure 1).</p><p>The current assay results, combined with new geological understanding, confirms the presence of volcanogenic mineralization (A-Zone type) over the whole strike length between the McLeod Zone and A-Zone. The strike length across the mineralized zones is approximately 1.4 km, with a confirmed depth up to 150 m from the surface.</p><p>A soil survey completed north of the Sturgeon River, 1.5 km north of the McLeod Zone highlighted several copper anomalies, confirming the potential for additional volcanogenic mineralization North of the current area of focus.</p><p>Diamond Drilling Results:</p><p>Drilling resumed on August 19, 2021, following the lifting of the forest fire restrictions in the region. In-fill drilling focussed on linking the A-Zone and the McLeod Zone mineralized horizons. A total of 11 drill holes were completed to date, and LAURION is pleased to issue results of the first two drill holes, LBX21-045 and 046.</p><p>Mineralization occurs in a series of intermediate to felsic volcanic units cut by dioritic dykes. The majority of the mineralization is located in pervasive pyrite-sphalerite-quartz-carbonate stockworks and veins, with some massive sulphide horizons. A two (2) metre long semi-massive sulphide interval was intersected in hole LBX21-046 and is composed of sphalerite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-galena (see Figure 1). Brecciated quartz, magnetite banding with strong sericite-chlorite and silica alteration is also observed within the same intersection. The hole was stopped in a mineralized quartz vein (last 3.5 metres) due to technical issues on the hole. The completed results for the mineralized zones can be found in Table 1 below.</p><p>Table 1: Selected Best Results from Diamond Drilling Connecting the Mineralized Zone Between McLeod Zone and A-Zone: //st Hole ID From To (m) Length Au Ag Cu % Pb % Zn %</p><p>(m) (m) g/t g/t LBX21-046 138.50 152.00 13.50 0.71 13.29 0.17 0.27 2.22 including 149.00 151.00 2.00 2.90 61.83 0.92 0.91 10.78 LBX21-045 145.00 165.00 20.00 0.77 4.31 0.04 0.03 0.83 LBX21-040 41.00 46.50 5.50 0.38 5.72 0.11 0.03 0.60 LBX21-041 37.00 41.00 4.00 0.95 2.26 - - - LBX21-042 200.00 204.00 4.00 0.38 14.29 0.13 0.32 3.12 LBX21-043 46.00 53.30 10.30 0.49 10.27 0.06 0.06 0.80 LBX21-044 98.00 107.00 9.00 0.47 1.66 0.02 0.01 0.71 Note: At this time the true width of the mineralized interval is unknown.</p><p>Since the discovery of the McLeod Zone, there has been very little exploration conducted in the swamp area between both showings (McLeod and A-Zone) and recent advances showed that the A-Zone mineralization is similar to the McLeod Zone. Based on LAURION's recent exploration focus in the area, this sector was prioritized for the second phase of the 2021 drilling campaign. Results from LBX21-045 and LBX21-046 aided in confirming the continuity along strike between both zones. These results combined with the discovery of two historical trenches south-west of McLeod Zone show that the system remains open in all directions.</p><p>Table 2: Drill hole coordinates for drill holes LBX21-040 to -046. //st Hole ID Azimuth Dip Length Easting Northing Elevation LBX21-040 307 -67 368 445947.2 5512615.2 322.4 LBX21-041 130 -80 278 446235.8 5512740.5 323.6 LBX21-042 70 -45 338 446280.2 5512838.2 320.2 LBX21-043 108 -70 201 446574.0 5513109.6 326.1 LBX21-044 108 -55 194 446533.9 5513141.6 322.3 LBX21-045 108 -50 326 446293.5 5512693.9 322.2 LBX21-046 108 -50 155.4 446319.4 5512744.8 322.1</p><p>Soil Sampling Results</p><p>In the past, limited exploration work was conducted in the northern area of the Ishkoday project. A total of 5 historic drill holes were completed on the River Showing and yielded good results (DDH 88-22 with 10.37m @ 0.20 g/t Au 13.62 g/t Ag and 1.22% Cu).</p><p>Previous grab samples also yielded copper results grading over 1.8% Cu. Two magnetic high anomalies are also present on the northern portion of the project, which are interpreted to represent possible extensions of the A-Zone system.</p><p>A soil sampling survey was conducted to cover the eastern part of the property up to 1km north of the Namewaminikan river, which is located 700m north of the A-Zone. A total of 859 samples were taken from the B-horizon in available soils. All samples were dried, sieved and assayed onsite using a portable XRF to detect any anomalies in base metals. Copper returned anomalous results ranging from 25ppm up to 191ppm for 48 samples. Indications from soil sampling, grab sampling and historical drilling, indicate a potential extension of mineralization over that area and requires further prospecting and possible trenching (See Figure 2).</p><p>QAQC</p><p>All core samples have been assayed by ALS Laboratories in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Samples are processed by 4-acid digestion and analyzed by fire assay on 50 g pulps and ICP-AES (Inductively-Coupled-Plasma - Atomic-Element-Spectroscopy). Over limit analyses are reprocessed with gravimetric finish. A total of 5% blanks and 5% standard are inserted randomly within all samples. 5% of the best assays results pulps will be sent for re-assays. A total of 8.7% blanks and 9.5% standard were randomly inserted during the pXRF analyse of the soil sampling. 2.8% we re-analyzed. All QAQC were verified, and no contamination or bias have been observed.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with Canadian regulatory requirements and has been reviewed and approved by Jean Philippe Paiement, P.Geo., MSc., a consultant to LAURION, and a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p>About LAURION</p><p>The Corporation is a junior mineral exploration and development company listed on the TSXV under the symbol LME and on the OTCPINK under the symbol LMEFF. LAURION now has 238,069,240 outstanding shares of which approximately 79% are owned and controlled by Insiders who are eligible investors under the \"Friends and Family\" categories.</p><p>LAURION's emphasis is on the development of its flagship project, the 100% owned mid-stage 47 km2 Ishkoday Project, and its gold-silver and gold-rich polymetallic mineralization with a significant upside potential. The mineralization on Ishkoday is open at depth beyond the current core-drilling limit of -200 m from surface, based on the historical mining to a -685 m depth, in the past producing Sturgeon River Mine. The Brenbar Property, acquired in 2020, is contiguous with the Ishkoday Property and hosts the historic Brenbar Mine. LAURION believes the mineralization to be a direct extension of mineralization from the Ishkoday Property.</p><p>Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements, which reflect the Corporation's current expectations regarding future events, including with respect to LAURION's business, operations and condition, and management's objectives, strategies, beliefs and intentions.

He took an early retirement in 2001 after his wife passed away from cancer in 1994 at the age of 42. </p><p>At the time of her death, Barton's son and daughter were teenagers, and several years later he came to the conclusion that \u201clife's too short\u201d not to enjoy it. But he was coaxed back by the mayor in 2008 after Nipissing carried out a study of its operations and decided it should have a chief administrative officer. </p><p>\u201cThey wanted me to work full time, but I said no and we settled on three days a week,\u201d says Barton, 71. </p><p>Barton studied business administration at Canadore College when it was still a campus of Sudbury's Cambrian College before becoming an independent institution in 1972. </p><p>Born and raised in Nipissing Township and after graduating from college, Barton began working at the Bank of Nova Scotia's main branch in North Bay in 1971. He spent nine years as a Scotiabank employee and, during that time, he and his family moved eight times. </p><p>\u201cI liked working for the bank, but I didn't like moving all the time. And when the kids started to get into school, they didn't want to keep moving either,\u201d Barton recalls. </p><p>When he was growing up, Barton knew the type of work he wanted to do. He liked three careers, namely becoming a bank manager, a township clerk or a church minister. </p><p>He ended up in banking, and when the financial sector took him to Sault Ste. Marie, he played the organ at the church the Barton family attended. It was then he got a phone call from the then reeve of Nipissing. </p><p>Barton recalls the conversation. </p><p>\u201cHe said 'The clerk's job in Nipissing is coming up, You better apply,'\u201d Barton recalls. \u201cI said 'OK,' applied and got the job. So I guess with me now finally retiring I won't become a minister.\u201d </p><p>LONE OFFICE EMPLOYEE </p><p>Barton first started at the township office on May 5, 1980, as the municipality's clerk, treasurer and tax collector. </p><p>At the time, he was the only office member, although the township had a roads superintendent who also was in charge of the landfill. </p><p>\u201cI looked after the office, cemetery and recreation,\u201d Barton recalls. </p><p>Since those early days in 1980, Barton has seen several major changes and he had input in bringing them about. </p><p>For example there was no zoning bylaw or official plan, which he helped create. </p><p>Also, there was no fire department. Several portable pumps are what the township used to fight fires. </p><p>Barton recalls one of the pumps was stationed at the township office, another was in Commanda Township, a third in Nipissing and one pump was in place for the island properties. </p><p>The former Ministry of Natural Resources would help Nipissing Township in the event of a forest fire. And if there was a structure fire too large for the community to fight on its own, Callander would send its firefighters. </p><p>Although a group of volunteers built the township's first fire department on Wasi Road, Barton says the community wouldn't see a full fire department until the late 1980s. </p><p>When Barton agreed to return in 2008, he assumed the roles of chief administrative officer and clerk, and a little later he was named deputy treasurer. </p><p>With Barton's latest departure, town council has named Kris Croskery-Hodgins the interim CAO-clerk-treasurer. </p><p>Prior to the appointment, Croskery-Hodgins was the treasurer and deputy clerk. </p><p>It was during Barton's second life with the township that the office personnel began to expand. He says Croskery-Hodgins was hired as was John-Paul Negrinotti, who looked after issues such as zoning bylaws, minor severances and variances in his role as the municipal planning official. </p><p>'LONG SUCCESSION PLAN' </p><p>Over the succeeding years, Barton trained both of the new employees calling what he was doing a \u201clong succession plan. </p><p>\u201cThey're trained, ready to take over and it was time for me to retire,\u201d he says. </p><p>Over his two stints at the township hall, Barton worked with 13 town councils, speaking highly of the elected officials. </p><p>\u201cI never had a bad council in all those years,\u201d he says. </p><p>Barton says he enjoyed going to work every day over the decades, adding \u201cyou never knew what was going to happen.\u201d </p><p>Nipissing Township has a core, year-round population of 1,700 people, but swells to more than 3,000 residents during tourist season. Barton says he could always expect a call of some sort almost daily. </p><p>Barton originally intended to retire last year, but when COVID-19 struck he agreed to stay on a little longer. But after that additional year, Barton says the time to leave is now. </p><p>Council, he says, is in the third year of a four-year term and he didn't want to leave during an election year or leave when the new council is elected. </p><p>\u201cThat was at the back of my mind,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cBut now with me gone, they can hire a new person who can be trained for next year's election.\u201d </p><p>'GOOD' RESERVES </p><p>Barton says he's leaving the township in excellent financial shape adding \u201cour reserves are good.\u201d He most recently helped bring about a new official plan and last December the zoning bylaw was updated. </p><p>Barton personally hopes council sees its way to make Croskery-Hodgins the permanent CAO. </p><p>\u201cI hope council sees Kris would be the logical choice if they do advertise for a chief administrative officer,\u201d he says. </p><p>Barton lives on a 170-acre property and in the same home where he was born. His daughter lives next door to him in Nipissing and his son about one kilometre away. </p><p>He has four grandchildren, one great-grandchild and a female companion in the Burk's Falls area. </p><p>With his municipal career over, Barton says he now has more time for recreational activities like snowmobiling on his land, and come this summer he can golf on a nine-hole course he put on his land. </p><p>He also recently bought a piano. </p><p>\u201cSo I have lots to do,\u201d he says. </p><p>Rocco Frangione is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the North Bay Nugget.

We sent a series of questions to some of them in hopes they can fill us in on how they felt the expiring year has gone for them and their area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following are their edited responses:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aaron Stone, Mayor, Ladysmith</p><p>As 2021 comes to a close, what will you remember most about this year as mayor?</p><p>I will remember teamwork. It's been another challenging year dealing with COVID-19, the wildfire, social issues, racial injustice and reconciliation. Through it all, our community came together again and again. Community groups stepped up to make the best of every difficult situation, lifting our spirits through events and initiatives to remind us of the good there is in Ladysmith and beyond. Working with Chief Harris on bringing Stz'uminus and Ladysmith closer together through sharing and creating understanding of our past, our present and shared hope for a prosperous future. Our staff at the town stepping up and adapting to every change thrown at them, recognizing and prioritizing what's most important when we needed them most. I'll remember the kindness of people in our community through such a difficult time. It's been a tough year to be sure, but there were so many bright lights in these dark times that I can't pinpoint just one memory \u2013 the list is just too long. I just want to share my deepest gratitude to those who continue to come forward to support our community this year.</p><p>Have the town and council accomplished most of their goals for the year?</p><p>I think so. This year has necessarily been one of prioritizing and adapting to ensure what is most important gets done. A lot of the background work on big priorities and projects continues to progress well. Environmental and engineering assessments on the waterfront. Work on the first phase of the arts and heritage hub is progressing toward construction. The first phases of the new official community plan, including a climate action strategy. Improvements to Transfer Beach Park will be completed in 2021. It's been a lot of the hard, quiet work this year but that fit well in a year where COVID still dominates our lives, and it puts us in a good position moving forward. I'm as excited about the future of Ladysmith today as I've ever been.</p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected?</p><p>Well, we didn't get all the key grants we have been working toward. Our No. 1 priority continues to be water and we have everything in place to ensure both the quality and quantity of water for generations to come, we just need the final funding piece from senior government. Although we did not receive the funding this year, I am confident that this will come sooner than later. With the improvements to water distribution efficiency and increased reservoir capacity, we will be prepared for the rapidly changing climate we are experiencing and able to accommodate future growth.</p><p>Better than expected, I'd say the financial management of the town during the pandemic. Over the last few years, Ladysmith has been a leader in tightening the financial plan to minimize tax increases while ensuring the growth we are experiencing becomes a net contributor to our future. I look forward to another prudent financial plan that respects the uncertain times we are living in while making smart, targeted investments in our future. A lot of credit for this success goes staff who have managed these challenging times in a creative, strategic and thoughtful way.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished?</p><p>I'd like to set the stage for great success for the next council, whether I am part of that team or not. I want to ensure the town continues to plan and save for the future while making key, targeted investments in a bright future for Ladysmith. I'd like to see shovels in the ground on the waterfront with the arts and heritage hub. I'd like to ensure our water plans are finely tuned and funded to ensure clean water for our future children, grandchildren and beyond. I look forward to a completed OCP that protects the history and natural beauty of Ladysmith while extending our climate leadership through smart growth, active transportation and a complete community that is vibrant and enjoyable for all ages, incomes and abilities. This work is complicated and takes time, but we are making great progress. Finally, I want to see our Stz'uminus neighbours better represented within Ladysmith. This is our town, as Chief Harris says, the big 'we.' We are more vital, more prosperous, richer in culture, caring, environment and so much more by being together. The more we do together, the more we learn, the more it lifts us all up together. There is so much to do, but I believe in Ladysmith and Stz'uminus more than ever.</p><p>Al Siebring, Mayor, North Cowichan</p><p>As 2021 comes to a close, what will you remember most about this year?</p><p>2021 was supposed to be the year we were going to 'come out of COVID.' Of course, that didn't happen. So the ongoing virtual meetings were definitely one of the stand-out things of the year, although not necessarily in a good way. That, combined with the summer fires and heat domes and the flooding in December made it a more stressful year than usual.</p><p>Has North Cowichan accomplished most of its goals for the year?</p><p>Council has set a number of strategic priorities; they weren't tied to specific calendar years, but rather are meant to cover the entire term. It remains to be seen whether all of those priorities will be achieved before the elections in October of 2022, but we are well on our way with many/most of them.</p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected?</p><p>Again, '21 was 'supposed to be' the end of COVID. So that's obviously a disappointment. As for what's gone better than expected, I continue to be pleasantly surprised at the resiliency of both of staff and our broader community in dealing with the challenges we faced.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished?</p><p>We are continuing to work on the goals in our strategic plan. Those include completing the review of our municipal forestry reserve, and the writing of a new official community plan. I have been clear from the beginning that it's a very ambitious goal to have either of these projects actually 'done' by the end of the term. Both of them require considerable public engagement, and that's been very challenging to do in a way that has full community buy-in given that it's all being done virtually.</p><p>Lynne Smith, regional director, Saltair</p><p>As 2021 comes to a close, what will you remember most about this year as Area G director?</p><p>After two unsuccessful grant applications for the Saltair water filtration system it was one of those amazing dancing-in-the-street moments when the Saltair water system was allocated federal infrastructure grant funding this year. Also working with Island Health to allow work permits for the Saltair water distribution system upgrades to start up again after a couple of years without work being accomplished.</p><p>Has the CVRD board accomplished most of its goals for the year?</p><p>With multiple emergencies this year within the CVRD boundaries and staffing shortages some of the goals for the CVRD board may have fallen a bit behind. The CVRD staff have been stepping up constantly to take on new challenges and keeping the CVRD services running during these unprecedented time. Kudos to them all.</p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected?</p><p>Saltair community parks reserve funding added to the budget for upgrades to two of our community park trails sadly did not happen under the CVRD parks and trails work plan.</p><p>With Area G Saltair/Gulf Islands residents starting to receive their COVID vaccines in early 2021 there was a new feel in the community as residents felt more comfortable being out and about. There was a small Halloween event, with children encouraged to grow their own pumpkins for a weigh-in at Halloween.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished?</p><p>If millions of dollars fell from the sky I would ask that the CVRD board work on the Cowichan Valley Trail to create an active transportation corridor from North Oyster/Diamond all the way to Mill Bay/Malahat. Personally, I would like to see the Saltair filtration system installed and running in 2022, the Thetis Island wharf revitalization project completed, work continue on the water distribution system upgrades, Diana, Princess of Wales Park trails upgraded, Centennial Park forested trail upgraded, Stocking Creek Park bridge replaced and a very large grant for the Stocking Lake Dam.</p><p>Ben Maartman, regional director, Diamond-North Oyster</p><p>As 2021 comes to a close, what will you remember most about this year as Area H director?</p><p>It's been a very strange introduction to local government. Almost all my interactions with the board and CVRD staff has been online. I haven't met many people face to face and I look forward to when that can happen.</p><p>What I will remember about this year is how so many people have stepped up to help others. An example of this was with the Mt. Hayes forest fire. Horse trailers lined up to evacuate livestock from the locations close to the fire were loaded up and headed out to nearby farms. The people I spoke to in the affected area had sleepless nights wondering if they would be required to leave at a moment's notice. All had been contacted, not just by friends offering help, but by strangers that had space for animals and rooms for people. It meant so much to them to have that generosity.</p><p>Has the CVRD board accomplished most of its goals for the year?</p><p>I think it has been a really tough year to meet any goals. However, two accomplishments of note for electoral areas were keeping the 2021 budget increase close to zero and the completion of the harmonization of the official community plan.</p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected?</p><p>Honestly, I think we moved from one emergency to another. It seemed like the CVRD always had the regional emergency operations centre up and running. And this on top of dealing with a pandemic and a number of weeks where the Ingram Street building was out of commission due to a water leak. Yet, business carried on and a shout out to the CVRD staff for their ability to maintain services to our community.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished?</p><p>The modernizing of the OCP will soon be underway. I would like to see a robust process completed that really taps into the voice of the community. Next, there is a proposal for a community well for potable water. I would like to see this finished in 2022.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@nanaimobulletin.com\">editor@nanaimobulletin.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2022 Ladysmith Chronicle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LDYCHR-news20220101PCO4262616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LDYCHR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64F9-TFP1-F0HF-801T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

It\u2019s been a lot of the hard, quiet work this year but that fit well in a year where COVID still dominates our lives, and it puts us in a good position moving forward. I\u2019m as excited about the future of Ladysmith today as I\u2019ve ever been.</p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected? LYNNE SMITH Regional director Saltair As 2021 comes to a close, what will you remember most about this year as Area G director? After two unsuccessful grant applications for the Saltair water filtration system it was one of those amazing dancing-in-the-street moments when the Saltair water system was allocated federal infrastructure grant funding this year. Also working with Island Health to allow work permits for the Saltair water distribution system upgrades to start up again after a couple of years without work being accomplished.</p><p>Has the CVRD board accomplished most of its goals for the year? With multiple emergencies this year within the CVRD boundaries and staffing shortages some of the goals for the CVRD board may have fallen a bit behind. The CVRD staff have been stepping up constantly to take on new challenges and keeping the CVRD services running during these unprecedented time. Kudos to them all.</p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected? Saltair community parks reserve funding added to the budget for upgrades to two of our community park trails sadly did not happen under the CVRD parks and trails work plan.</p><p>BEN MA ARTMAN Regional director Diamond-N. Oyster As 2021 comes to a close, what will you remember most about this year as Area H director? It\u2019s been a very strange introduction to local government. Almost all my interactions with the board and CVRD staff has been online. I haven\u2019t met many people face to face and I look forward to when that can happen.</p><p>What I will remember about this year is how so many people have stepped up to help others. An example of this was with the Mt. Hayes forest fire. Horse trailers lined up to evacuate livestock from the locations close to the fire were loaded up and headed out to nearby farms. The people I spoke to in the affected area had sleepless nights wondering if they would be required to leave at a moment\u2019s notice. All had been contacted, not just by friends offering help, but by strangers that had space for animals and rooms for people. It meant so much to them to have that generosity.</p><p>Has the CVRD board accomplished most of its goals for the year? I think it has been a really tough year to meet any goals. However, two accomplishments of note for electoral areas were keeping the 2021 budget increase close to zero and the completion of the harmonization of the official community plan.</p><p>Well, we didn\u2019t get all the key grants we have been working toward. Our No. 1 priority continues to be water and we have everything in place to ensure both the quality and quantity of water for generations to come, we just need the final funding piece from senior government. Although we did not receive the funding this year, I am confident that this will come sooner than later. With the improvements to water distribution efficiency and increased reservoir capacity, we will be prepared for the rapidly changing climate we are experiencing and able to accommodate future growth.</p><p>Better than expected, I\u2019d say the financial management of the town during the pandemic. Over the last few years, Ladysmith has been a leader in tightening the financial plan to minimize tax increases while ensuring the growth we are experiencing becomes a net contributor to our future. I look forward to another prudent financial plan that respects the uncertain times we are living in while making smart, targeted investments in our future. A lot of credit for this success goes staff who have managed these challenging times in a creative, strategic and thoughtful way.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished? I\u2019d like to set the stage for great success for the next council, whether I am part of that team or not. I want to ensure the town continues to plan and save for the future while making key, targeted investments in a bright future for Ladysmith. I\u2019d like to see shovels in the ground on the waterfront with the arts and heritage hub. I\u2019d like to ensure our water plans are finely tuned and funded to ensure clean water for our future children, grandchildren and beyond. I look forward to a completed OCP that protects the history and natural beauty of Ladysmith while extending our climate leadership through smart growth, active transportation and a complete community that is vibrant and enjoyable for all ages, incomes and abilities. This work is complicated and takes time, but we are making great progress. Finally, I want to see our Stz\u2019uminus neighbours better represented within Ladysmith. This is our town, as Chief Harris says, the big \u2018we.\u2019 We are more vital, more prosperous, richer in culture, caring, environment and so much more by being together. The more we do together, the more we learn, the more it lifts us all up together. There is so much to do, but I believe in Ladysmith and Stz\u2019uminus more than ever.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Iadysmithchronide.com\">www.Iadysmithchronide.com</url></p><p>With Area G Saltair/Gulf Islands residents starting to receive their COVID vaccines in early 2021 there was a new feel in the community as residents felt more comfortable being out and about. There was a small Halloween event, with children encouraged to grow their own pumpkins for a weigh-in at Halloween.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished? If millions of dollars fell from the sky I would ask that the CVRD board work on the Co- wichan Valley Trail to create an active transportation corridor from North Oyster/Diamond all the way to Mill Bay/Malahat. Personally, I would like to see the Saltair filtration system installed and running in 2022, the Thetis Island wharf revitalization project completed, work continue on the water distribution system upgrades, Diana, Princess of Wales Park trails upgraded, Centennial Park forested trail upgraded, Stocking Creek Park bridge replaced and a very large grant for the Stocking Lake Dam.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Iadysmithchronicle.com\">www.Iadysmithchronicle.com</url></p><p>What has not gone the way it was supposed to in 2021 and what has gone better than expected? Honestly, I think we moved from one emergency to another. It seemed like the CVRD always had the regional emergency operations centre up and running. And this on top of dealing with a pandemic and a number of weeks where the Ingram Street building was out of commission due to a water leak. Yet, business carried on and a shout out to the CVRD staff for their ability to maintain services to our community.</p><p>In your final 10 months in this term, what would you personally like to see finished? The modernizing of the OCP will soon be underway. I would like to see a robust process completed that really taps into the voice of the community.</p><p>Next, there is a proposal for a community well for potable water. I would like to see this finished in 2022.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Iadysmithchronide.com\">www.Iadysmithchronide.com</url></p><p>Special to the Chronicle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LDYCHR-news20211230PQQA0002342339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LDYCHR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64DW-WTX1-JD2C-J30Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

(TSXV: LME) (OTCPINK: LMEFF)\u00a0(\"LAURION\" or the \"Corporation\")\u00a0is pleased to announce\u00a0the following update on its exploration program of 2021at the Ishkoday Property:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights:</p><p> Trenching and stripping exposed 4 new mineralized areas of interest: The A Zone, the Niish and Garvey Zone and a new zone, the Pond, located near the McLeod prospect. New mineralized lenses of semi-massive sulfides were stripped on the A-Zone. Further assays are pending. A new mineralized zone of 4 sub-parallel veins, called 'The Pond' has also been exposed. These veins are part of the McLeod mineralized system, which is hosted in a sequence of felsic-intermediate volcanic and strikes N215 with a 70 dip to the South. Mineralization can be found in 4 distinct sub-parallel veins which are 20m apart and are composed of brecciated quartz with disseminated fine pyrite (up to 15%), chalcopyrite and sphalerite. The LiDAR survey shows a possible extension of more than 400m along strike. Mapping, interpretation, and final assay results are still pending. A soil sampling survey has been designed to cover 3 magnetic high anomalies located north of the Namewaminikan River. The areas show low historical prospecting, low outcrop density and thick vegetation. The magnetic anomalies are interpreted to represent a possible extension of the north-south feature observed in the southern portion of the Property. Historic grab samples from this area produced anomalous values (0.082 g/t Au, 11.9 g/t Ag and 0.89% Cu and 0.356 g/t Au, 37.6 g/t Ag and 1.52% Cu) for both base and precious metal in exposed trenching. A LiDAR survey was conducted at the end of May over the entire property. This high precision laser imaging survey provided Laurion with a high-definition digital elevation model (DEM). The new DEM model is key in the interpretation of the structural feature on the property. Historical trenches are also evident on the survey and are aiding the geological team in the further expansion of already known mineralized zones.The 10,000m 2021 diamond drill program has been paused due to the current forest fire hazards (see press release from July 21st, 2021). Of the initial of 6,079 meters of drilling completed to date, assay results for 4,758 meters of drilling have been received and highlights are shown in Table 1 below. </p><p>Exploration drilling in 2021 started with the objective of defining the mineralized system along a strike extension of 1.25 km from the A-Zone, (Behzik Zone) 2020 Niish discovery zone to the McLeod Zone. Preliminary observations and results confirmed the existence of an extension of the new Niish structure\u00a0850m to the northeast in drill hole\u00a0LBX21-032. Drilling confirmed the extension at depth of the Behzik zone at around 410m below surface level as well of its steep dip to the northwest.</p><p>The initial drill holes targeted unexplored areas to depths, approximately 650m from surface, across the 1.25 km strike to investigate the geometry and grade distribution of the greater Niish and Behzik zone. The drilling was also conducted with the objective of understanding the litho-structural model and define the mineralized system as seen in historic (1980s and 1990s) and LAURION (2012 to 2020) drilling, which intersected significant grades and widths of gold and base metal mineralization.</p><p>Highlights from the 7 initial exploratory holes:</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\"

(\"LAURION\" or the \"Corporation\") is pleased to announce the following update on its exploration program of 2021at the Ishkoday Property:</p><p>Highlights: //st * Trenching and stripping exposed 4 new mineralized areas of interest: The A Zone, the Niish and Garvey Zone and a new zone, the Pond, located near the McLeod prospect. * New mineralized lenses of semi-massive sulfides were stripped on the A-Zone. Further assays are pending. * A new mineralized zone of 4 sub-parallel veins, called 'The Pond' has also been exposed. These veins are part of the McLeod mineralized system, which is hosted in a sequence of felsic-intermediate volcanic and strikes N215 with a 70 dip to the South. Mineralization can be found in 4 distinct sub-parallel veins which are 20m apart and are composed of brecciated quartz with disseminated fine pyrite (up to 15%), chalcopyrite and sphalerite. The LiDAR survey shows a possible extension of more than 400m along strike. Mapping, interpretation, and final assay results are still pending. * A soil sampling survey has been designed to cover 3 magnetic high anomalies located north of the Namewaminikan River. The areas show low historical prospecting, low outcrop density and thick vegetation. The magnetic anomalies are interpreted to represent a possible extension of the north-south feature observed in the southern portion of the Property. Historic grab samples from this area produced anomalous values (0.082 g/t Au, 11.9 g/t Ag and 0.89% Cu and 0.356 g/t Au, 37.6 g/t Ag and 1.52% Cu) for both base and precious metal in exposed trenching. * A LiDAR survey was conducted at the end of May over the entire property. This high precision laser imaging survey provided Laurion with a high-definition digital elevation model (DEM). The new DEM model is key in the interpretation of the structural feature on the property. Historical trenches are also evident on the survey and are aiding the geological team in the further expansion of already known mineralized zones. * The 10,000m 2021 diamond drill program has been paused due to the current forest fire hazards (see press release from July 21st, 2021). Of the initial of 6,079 meters of drilling completed to date, assay results for 4,758 meters of drilling have been received and highlights are shown in Table 1 below.</p><p>Exploration drilling in 2021 started with the objective of defining the mineralized system along a strike extension of 1.25 km from the A-Zone, (Behzik Zone) 2020 Niish discovery zone to the McLeod Zone. Preliminary observations and results confirmed the existence of an extension of the new Niish structure 850m to the northeast in drill hole LBX21-032. Drilling confirmed the extension at depth of the Behzik zone at around 410m below surface level as well of its steep dip to the northwest.</p><p>The initial drill holes targeted unexplored areas to depths, approximately 650m from surface, across the 1.25 km strike to investigate the geometry and grade distribution of the greater Niish and Behzik zone. The drilling was also conducted with the objective of understanding the litho-structural model and define the mineralized system as seen in historic (1980s and 1990s) and LAURION (2012 to 2020) drilling, which intersected significant grades and widths of gold and base metal mineralization.</p><p>Highlights from the 7 initial exploratory holes: //st Hole ID From To Core Au Ag Cu % Zn % AuEq</p><p>Length* g/t g/t LBX21-032 206.20 228.80 22.60 0.01 0.81 0.02 0.60 0.36</p><p>286.00 293.70 7.70 0.08 3.12 0.09 1.39 0.97</p><p>653.50 655.30 1.80 0.44 13.30 0.13 5.08 3.42 LBX21-033 359.70 361.50 1.80 1.95 4.27 0.22 1.15 2.96</p><p>492.00 494.90 2.90 0.37 8.53 0.26 1.01 1.43 LBX21-034 131.10 133.00 1.90 1.55 9.47 0.07 2.26 2.94</p><p>150.40 153.40 3.00 0.34 4.52 0.10 1.42 1.28</p><p>304.30 312.70 8.40 0.15 2.34 0.05 1.19 0.86 LBX21-035 423.40 432.40 9.00 1.50 10.63 0.33 1.04 2.71</p><p>429.20 432.40 3.20 4.13 26.20 0.90 2.22 7.07 LBX21-036 108.00 109.00 1.00 3.94 1.30 0.00 0.01 3.97</p><p>438.80 441.90 3.10 0.93 15.80 0.43 0.81 2.26</p><p>512.50 515.80 3.30 0.20 3.23 0.10 2.52 1.68</p><p>522.30 532.20 9.90 0.03 0.66 0.03 0.56 0.37 LBX21-037 125.00 127.80 2.80 1.73 1.79 0.02 0.07 1.84</p><p>416.40 425.60 9.20 0.03 3.69 0.16 1.54 1.11</p><p>517.30 532.00 14.70 0.24 0.25 0.00 0.01 0.25 LBX21-038 303.10 306.50 3.40 0.04 3.78 0.09 1.30 0.89 //st *True thicknesses have yet to be estimated since the 3D modelling of the zones is still pending updates</p><p>Table 2: Drill hole coordinates for holes LBX21-032 to LBX21-039.

TMC Geophysics is a leading geophysical services provider to the mineral exploration industry with its head office in Canada. The purpose of the CSAMT survey is to map silicification and structure at depth related to the hydrothermal system with the overarching objective to refine drill hole targets to test for a high-grade mineralized body at depth that is feeding the high-grade quartz-veined breccias observed at surface. The CSAMT survey is also anticipated to trace the Breccia Zone to the south where magnetic data indicates it continues under alluvium cover.  <br/>The CSAMT survey is designed to cover the majority of the Property and will include 15 lines at a 200 m spacing totaling approximately 472 stations and 26 line-kilometers. Crews from TMC Geophysics are being mobilized to site over the next few days. <br/>Drill Program <br/>Initial challenging drilling conditions, coupled with regional forest fires forcing a reworking of some site logistics, had hindered the operations of the drilling over the first half of the program resulting in slower than anticipated progress. However, the drill advancement rate and conditions have improved over the past week, as well as the forest fire risk abated, and the program is now proceeding with more momentum.  <br/>A total of approximately 1,295.7 m (4,251 ft) over seven (7) drill holes have been completed to date - BG21-001, 002, 003, 003a, 004, 005, and 006. Core length depths range from 69.2 m (DDH BG21-003, lost due to hole conditions) and 296.3 m (DDH BG21-006), with all holes oriented to intercept and cross at depth the breccia unit that defines the Meadows Fault Zone. The Company is pleased to report that the breccia unit has been successfully intersected in each hole and is characterized by variable widths of heavy iron-manganese oxide and clay alteration, quartz veining, and silicification, with the unit similar in appearance to that observed at surface. Occurrences of bladed quartz have also been encountered in several drill holes.  <br/>Significant clay alteration and occurrences of bladed quartz in drill core are characteristics consistent with the uppermost regions of a low-sulphidation epithermal system. In addition, quartz veining and silicification are observed to increase with depth of the breccia zone intercepted in drill core.  <br/>The Company anticipates reporting core sample assays for the first batch of drill holes in the next few weeks, once it has received full and final results. Core samples are being analyzed by Activation Laboratories at their Kamloops facility, BC. <br/>The Company has submitted a five-year Plan of Operations to the United States Forestry Service for extended exploration of the Breccia Gold Property (see news release dated May 17, 2021). The permit, once received, will allow the Company to explore the Property for five consecutive years, under the same authorization, providing significant advantages and flexibility for follow-up aggressive and expanded diamond drilling on the Property. Coupled with the CSMAT data, the Company intends to continue delineating the near-surface breccia unit, as well as targeting the roots of the system where silicification and quartz stockwork veining, associated with gold mineralization, are anticipated to be 'mapped' by the CSAMT survey.  <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6338/97001_509e3329b47c092a_001full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6338/97001_509e3329b47c092a_001full.jpg</url><br/>Breccia Gold Property Drill Map <br/>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6338/97001_509e3329b47c092a_001full.jpg\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6338/97001_509e3329b47c092a_001full.jpg</url>[1] <br/>New Discovery of Breccia Outcrop <br/>As a result of the initial slower than anticipated drilling, the opportunity was taken to further prospect areas of the Property and follow-up on the mineralized occurrences discovered in 2020. The Company is pleased to report that the prospecting has led to the discovery of a new breccia outcrop occurrence located approximately 800 m north-northwest of the drill area, and several hundred metres west of the extensive gold in soil anomaly situated along the northern portions of the Meadow's Fault Zone. <br/>A total of 16 samples were collected from a series of large breccia outcrops, extending for least 200 m in a generally east-west direction. The discovery indicates a potential splay off the Meadow's Fault Zone and further highlights the surface exploration potential of the Property, and most specifically the north end of the Meadow's Fault Zone. Analytical results are expected to be reported shortly.  <br/>QP Disclosure <br/>Darren L. Smith, M.Sc., P. Geo., Director and Vice President of Exploration for the Company, and Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, supervised the preparation of the technical information in this news release. <br/>About the Breccia Gold Property <br/>The Breccia Gold Property consists of 98 claims covering approximately 1,973 acres (798 ha) within the Blackbird Mining District, in Lemhi County, approximately 40 kilometres southwest of Salmon, Idaho, USA. The Property is accessible by paved highway and a network of well-maintained gravel roads and is host to the historical Gahsmith Gold Mine. Exploration and development activity on the Property dates back to the 1930's and has been exploited by at least eight adits, with several thousand tons of mineralized quartz veined material extracted. In the 1980s, a bulk sample of 4,621 tons was completed with an average grade of 0.335 oz/t Au reported. The current Property includes the Meadows Fault Zone and the lesser explored, parallel Musgrove Mine Trend. Recent exploration carried out in 2018, 2019, and 2020 included the remapping and sampling of the Meadows Fault Zone and the results are suggestive of the existence of a significant low-sulfidation, epithermal gold system. Surface results include 57.6 g/t Au and 19.6 g/t Ag in outcrop, and 69 g/t Au and 27.5 g/t Ag in float.  <br/>About the Company <br/>Ophir Gold Corp. is a gold exploration company focused on the exploration and development of its flagship property, the past producing Breccia Gold Property located in Lemhi County, Idaho. The Company has an option to earn a 100% interest in the Property over a three-year period from Canagold Resources Ltd.

Crocker started questioning how long it took some food items to actually reach the dinner table and began learning more about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She eventually decided to see if her family could eat only local food for an entire year. The effort was captured in the documentary \"First We Eat,\" which became a learning experience about family dynamics, resourcefulness and the strengthening of community bonds.</p><p>\"There is just this very humbling experience when you know where every ingredient on your plate comes from,\" Crocker said. \"And like you really know. You knew the animal, you knew the hands that grew it, you knew the land that provided it. It's a pretty special connection. So I would say it's been, for me, transformative in many ways.\"</p><p>The film's world premiere was Thursday as part of Hot Docs 2020. The 104-minute documentary, distributed in Canada by Blue Ice Docs, runs online at hotdocs.ca until June 6.</p><p>Filming began in the summer of 2017 as Crocker banished all grocery store food from the house. For 12 months, her family would only eat food that was hunted, fished, gathered, grown or raised around Dawson City. Cupboards were cleared and the spice racks were too. No salt, no sugar - and no caffeine either. Tea and coffee habits ended cold turkey.</p><p>Her husband and three children - ages 17, 15 and 11 at the time - were all on board.</p><p>\"Certainly the family dynamic was ever present during the year and trying to stave off mutiny was ongoing,\" Crocker said with a laugh. \"I really had thought that I would be able to win my kids over through their stomachs with me in the kitchen cooking all the time for them.\"</p><p>Farmers and local community members got involved. Ice fishing and moose hunting helped provide protein, birch trees were tapped for sap and grounds around their home were explored for edible plants and flowers.</p><p>\"You hear that expression, 'It takes a community to raise a family,' \" Crocker said from Dawson City. \"Well it takes a community to feed a family too.\"</p><p>The back-to-basics approach had its challenges at times, especially with the frigid weather in the north. Storage skills were put to the test. Crocker, who said she didn't like to cook before starting the project, became quite proficient in the kitchen.</p><p>\"I thought that I was going to suffer a bit missing some of my favourite foods and the usual things that are in my cupboard,\" she said. \"And I quickly found that after a month or two, I didn't even miss them at all. So that was pretty cool to know how adaptable we are as humans.\"</p><p>Crocker, who also served as director, producer and cinematographer, also noticed improvements on the health front. Her high blood pressure returned to normal, she slept better and had more energy.</p><p>The documentary's release comes at an interesting time given the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional skills like gardening and baking have become more popular.</p><p>\"When a crisis hits, you realize that it's really in our own community that we turn because our dependence on infrastructure and a centralized system from far away is so fragile really,\" Crocker said. \"And we realize how fragile that is and how vulnerable we are when something like the pandemic hits or a road gets closed by a landslide or a forest fire or whatever.

Crocker started questioning how long it took some food items to actually reach the dinner table and began learning more about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She eventually decided to see if her family could eat only local food for an entire year. The effort was captured in the documentary \"First We Eat,\" which became a learning experience about family dynamics, resourcefulness and the strengthening of community bonds.</p><p>\"There is just this very humbling experience when you know where every ingredient on your plate comes from,\" Crocker said. \"And like you really know. You knew the animal, you knew the hands that grew it, you knew the land that provided it.</p><p>\"It's a pretty special connection. So I would say it's been, for me, transformative in many ways.\"</p><p>The film's world premiere is Thursday as part of Hot Docs 2020. The 104-minute documentary, distributed in Canada by \"Blue Ice Docs,\" runs online through the festival until June 6. </p><p>Filming began in the summer of 2017 as Crocker banished all grocery store food from the house. For 12 months, her family would only eat food that was hunted, fished, gathered, grown or raised around Dawson City.</p><p>Cupboards were cleared and the spice racks were too. No salt, no sugar - and no caffeine either. Tea and coffee habits ended cold turkey.</p><p>Her husband and three children - aged 17, 15 and 11 at the time - were all on board.</p><p>\"Certainly the family dynamic was ever-present during the year and trying to stave off mutiny was ongoing,\" Crocker said with a laugh. \"I really had thought that I would be able to win my kids over through their stomachs with me in the kitchen cooking all the time for them.\"</p><p>Farmers and local community members got involved. Ice fishing and moose hunting helped provide protein, birch trees were tapped for sap and grounds around their home were explored for edible plants and flowers.</p><p>\"You hear that expression, 'It takes a community to raise a family,' Crocker said from Dawson City. \"Well it takes a community to feed a family too.\"</p><p>The back-to-basics approach had its challenges at times, especially with the frigid weather in the north. Storage skills were put to the test. Crocker, who said she didn't like to cook before starting the project, became quite proficient in the kitchen.</p><p>\"I thought that I was going to suffer a bit missing some of my favourite foods and the usual things that are in my cupboard,\" she said. \"And I quickly found that after a month or two, I didn't even miss them at all.</p><p>\"So that was pretty cool to know how adaptable we are as humans.\"</p><p>Crocker, who also served as director, producer and cinematographer, also noticed improvements on the health front. Her high blood pressure returned to normal, she slept better and had more energy.</p><p>The documentary's release comes at an interesting time given the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional skills like gardening and baking have become more popular.</p><p>\"When a crisis hits, you realize that it's really in our own community that we turn because our dependence on infrastructure and a centralized system from far away is so fragile really,\" Crocker said. And we realize how fragile that is and how vulnerable we are when something like the pandemic hits or a road gets closed by a landslide or a forest fire or whatever.</p><p>\"I'm a strong believer in the more we can do locally, the better.\"</p><p>Crocker also directed \"All the Time in the World,\" which appeared at Hot Docs in 2015.

(TSXV:DMR) (\"Damara\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the Company has entered into a joint venture agreement with Universal Copper Ltd (\"Universal\") in respect of the Placer Mountain project (\"Placer Mountain\" or the \"Property\") located in British Columbia. As noted in the Damara press release dated April 30, 2021, Damara has completed its earn-in expenditures and exercised the option to acquire a 75% interest in Placer Mountain. Universal retains the remaining 25% interest.</p><p>Larry Nagy, President and CEO of Damara stated \"We are pleased to have finalized the Placer Mountain joint venture agreement with Universal and are extremely excited to commence exploration on the Placer Mountain Project. Despite last minute timing issues and limited drill site access when the Company first acquired the Project last December, the maiden 2020 drill program successfully demonstrated the presence of a significant gold-bearing vein system on the Project. The well-exposed Main Vein trends directly under post-mineral cover, which combined with the presence of widespread quartz-limonite float, indicate good potential for the discovery of buried and preserved mineralization elsewhere on the Project. We are also very excited to test the copper-gold porphyry target revealed by our teams' data compilation effort. The Company looks forward to updating the market with the Phase II results from our upcoming drill program planned for this late Summer/Early Fall\".</p><p>The Phase II exploration program includes a plan to collect approximately 2,500 B-horizon soil samples as well as complete a Soil Gas Hydrocarbon (SGH) orientation survey over and along strike of the Main Vein, where it trends underneath Eocene age post-mineral Princeton Group cover rocks.</p><p>Phase II will also consist of detail geological mapping, prospecting, and stream sediment sampling. With excellent weather conditions forecasted in Princeton, crews are expected to be able to continue exploration work without interruption. Numerous forest service roads provide excellent access throughout the Project. A recent forest fire and extensive logging in the area has exposed several new highly prospective areas showing widespread quartz-limonite vein float that were previously covered by heavy vegetation during historic exploration programs.</p><p>The quartz-limonite vein float occurs along a well-defined corridor identified by previous operators (Henneberry, 2018)1, which trends north from the main vein with a particularly strong concentration recently identified at the base of a Princeton Group exposure over 3.5 kilometers to the north of the Main Vein.</p><p>Damara will be focusing its exploration along an unconformity in the north of the Project, which separates Eocene Princeton Group and Triassic Nicola Group rocks (Figure 1), Northern Au-Ag Target). Select historic grab samples running up to 28.9 g/t Au and 100 g/t Ag have been collected</p><p>Click Image To View Full Size in the area2,3. The Princeton volcanics may have provided a protective cap, preventing erosion of underlying mineralization throughout the Project. Mineralization may be better preserved under Princeton Group cover than where exposed at surface at the Main Vein showing.</p><p>A comprehensive stream sediment sampling program (Figure 2) to test for the presence of elevated gold, arsenic and antimony may help locate additional zones of buried mineralization elsewhere on the Project.</p><p>An interesting copper-molybdenum-gold-silver-arsenic-antimony anomaly in the western portion of the property was detected in road side soil samples collected by historic operators, along trend and only ~13km from the producing Copper Mountain Cu-Au Mine. The soil anomaly occurs along a prominent north-south gravity lineament defined by a regional airborne survey flown by Geoscience BC (Figure 3). The lineament is coincident with the Summers Creek Fault Zone, a north-south belt of alkalic copper-gold porphyry showings which trend from Copper Mountain in the south through to Kodiak Copper's recent MPD discovery. The Summers Creek Fault Zone represents a deep-seated regional structure, that controlled the emplacement of copper-gold porphyry mineralization along the belt. The gravity lineament, and the inferred Summers Creek Fault Zone, pass directly through the western half of the Placer Mountain Property, representing a potential copper-gold porphyry target. The soil anomaly is coincident with a magnetic high anomaly, which is a key characteristic of alkalic porphyry systems which often have a high magnetite content. A 1,000 soil sample grid is planned over this porphyry target area.</p><p>Following receipt and interpretation of the Phase II exploration results, the Company aims to follow up with excavator trenching across selected new targets as well as a minimum 2,000-meter core drilling program as early as September of this year. The permits for this proposed work program are currently in place.</p><p>About Placer Mountain</p><p>The Placer Mountain Property is comprised of 22 mineral claims covering approximately 8,955 hectares located approximately 35km south of Princeton, British Columbia and is subject to the Universal and Wilson NSR.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. Gerald G.

(\"Ophir\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the start of the CSAMT geophysical program and provides an update on the drilling and surface exploration at the Breccia Gold Property (the \"Property\"), where it holds an option to earn 100% interest, located approximately 40 km southwest of Salmon, Idaho, and may be accessed directly by road.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Controlled Source Audio-frequency Magnetotelluric Survey (CSAMT)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company has engaged TMC Geophysics to carry out a Controlled Source Audio-frequency Magnetotelluric Survey (CSAMT) survey on the Property. TMC Geophysics is a leading geophysical services provider to the mineral exploration industry with its head office in Canada. The purpose of the CSAMT survey is to map silicification and structure at depth related to the hydrothermal system with the overarching objective to refine drill hole targets to test for a high-grade mineralized body at depth that is feeding the high-grade quartz-veined breccias observed at surface. The CSAMT survey is also anticipated to trace the Breccia Zone to the south where magnetic data indicates it continues under alluvium cover.</p><p>The CSAMT survey is designed to cover the majority of the Property and will include 15 lines at a 200 m spacing totaling approximately 472 stations and 26 line-kilometers. Crews from TMC Geophysics are being mobilized to site over the next few days.</p><p>Drill Program</p><p>Initial challenging drilling conditions, coupled with regional forest fires forcing a reworking of some site logistics, had hindered the operations of the drilling over the first half of the program resulting in slower than anticipated progress. However, the drill advancement rate and conditions have improved over the past week, as well as the forest fire risk abated, and the program is now proceeding with more momentum.</p><p>A total of approximately 1,295.7 m (4,251 ft) over seven (7) drill holes have been completed to date - BG21-001, 002, 003, 003a, 004, 005, and 006. Core length depths range from 69.2 m (DDH BG21-003, lost due to hole conditions) and 296.3 m (DDH BG21-006), with all holes oriented to intercept and cross at depth the breccia unit that defines the Meadows Fault Zone. The Company is pleased to report that the breccia unit has been successfully intersected in each hole and is characterized by variable widths of heavy iron-manganese oxide and clay alteration, quartz veining, and silicification, with the unit similar in appearance to that observed at surface. Occurrences of bladed quartz have also been encountered in several drill holes.</p><p>Significant clay alteration and occurrences of bladed quartz in drill core are characteristics consistent with the uppermost regions of a low-sulphidation epithermal system. In addition, quartz veining and silicification are observed to increase with depth of the breccia zone intercepted in drill core.</p><p>The Company anticipates reporting core sample assays for the first batch of drill holes in the next few weeks, once it has received full and final results. Core samples are being analyzed by Activation Laboratories at their Kamloops facility, BC.</p><p>The Company has submitted a five-year Plan of Operations to the United States Forestry Service for extended exploration of the Breccia Gold Property (see news release dated May 17, 2021). The permit, once received, will allow the Company to explore the Property for five consecutive years, under the same authorization, providing significant advantages and flexibility for follow-up aggressive and expanded diamond drilling on the Property. Coupled with the CSMAT data, the Company intends to continue delineating the near-surface breccia unit, as well as targeting the roots of the system where silicification and quartz stockwork veining, associated with gold mineralization, are anticipated to be 'mapped' by the CSAMT survey.</p><p>Breccia Gold Property Drill Map</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6338/97001_\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6338/97001_</url></p><p>New Discovery of Breccia Outcrop</p><p>As a result of the initial slower than anticipated drilling, the opportunity was taken to further prospect areas of the Property and follow-up on the mineralized occurrences discovered in 2020. The Company is pleased to report that the prospecting has led to the discovery of a new breccia outcrop occurrence located approximately 800 m north-northwest of the drill area, and several hundred metres west of the extensive gold in soil anomaly situated along the northern portions of the Meadow's Fault Zone.</p><p>A total of 16 samples were collected from a series of large breccia outcrops, extending for least 200 m in a generally east-west direction. The discovery indicates a potential splay off the Meadow's Fault Zone and further highlights the surface exploration potential of the Property, and most specifically the north end of the Meadow's Fault Zone. Analytical results are expected to be reported shortly.</p><p>QP Disclosure</p><p>Darren L. Smith, M.Sc., P. Geo., Director and Vice President of Exploration for the Company, and Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, supervised the preparation of the technical information in this news release.</p><p>About the Breccia Gold Property</p><p>The Breccia Gold Property consists of 98 claims covering approximately 1,973 acres (798 ha) within the Blackbird Mining District, in Lemhi County, approximately 40 kilometres southwest of Salmon, Idaho, USA. The Property is accessible by paved highway and a network of well-maintained gravel roads and is host to the historical Gahsmith Gold Mine. Exploration and development activity on the Property dates back to the 1930's and has been exploited by at least eight adits, with several thousand tons of mineralized quartz veined material extracted. In the 1980s, a bulk sample of 4,621 tons was completed with an average grade of 0.335 oz/t Au reported. The current Property includes the Meadows Fault Zone and the lesser explored, parallel Musgrove Mine Trend. Recent exploration carried out in 2018, 2019, and 2020 included the remapping and sampling of the Meadows Fault Zone and the results are suggestive of the existence of a significant low-sulfidation, epithermal gold system. Surface results include 57.6 g/t Au and 19.6 g/t Ag in outcrop, and 69 g/t Au and 27.5 g/t Ag in float.</p><p>About the Company</p><p>Ophir Gold Corp. is a gold exploration company focused on the exploration and development of its flagship property, the past producing Breccia Gold Property located in Lemhi County, Idaho. The Company has an option to earn a 100% interest in the Property over a three-year period from Canagold Resources Ltd. (formerly Canarc Resource Corp.) and DG Resource Management Ltd.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors</p><p>\"Shawn Westcott\"</p><p>Ophir Gold Corp.</p><p>For further information, please contact:</p><p>Shawn Westcott, CEO</p><p>Phone 1 (604) 365 6681</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:swestcott@ophirgoldcorp.com\">swestcott@ophirgoldcorp.com</email></p><p>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>Cautionary Note</p><p>The information contained herein contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

She said trappers are having to choose between snowmobiles and quads, a difficult choice when the ground doesn't set.</p><p>The Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board is currently funding a study on how climate change is impacting trapping.</p><p>\"This is a group of people who generally spend a lot of time on the land, some of these trappers are out for six to eight months on their traplines. So they're very connected to the land and the seasonal changes. More so than most people, even biologists, because they're living that kind of closeness to the land and remoteness,\" said Shannon Powell, a wildlife biologist who is conducting the survey.</p><p>Through 20-minute conversations with Yukon trappers, Powell is hoping to collect information on any changes being seen around species, limited access to traplines due to weather, forest fire impacts and travel conditions.</p><p>\"I'm just trying to see, is there something happening to begin with? If there is, is everybody seeing that? Or is it regional? And is there a way that maybe they can have more of a collective way to voice their concerns?\" Powell said.</p><p>Right now Powell is just in the process of connecting with trappers and gathering information.</p><p>She expects to have a better idea of the wide picture in the new year, but has already been aware anecdotally of safety issues on thinning ice and people needing to create alternative access trails.</p><p>Animals encountered by trappers &amp;#x26;#8211; in numbers and in fur quality &amp;#x26;#8211; could also provide important data for tracking climate change in the territory.</p><p>This year's premature heavy snowfall will likely help make that decision to use a snowmobile easy, but trappers have already faced a tough spring and summer of low sales due to COVID-19.</p><p>Trappers present on Oct. 24 at the Mount McIntyre Recreation Centre were selling all manner of local furs, including coyote, fox, beaver, mink and wolverine. Crafters offering mittens and slippers embellished with beadwork, as well as pom-poms, also set up tables.</p><p>The event was socially-distanced, and attendees wrote down names and numbers for contact tracing.</p><p>\"Right now, the fur industry is unstable because of the world's crisis of COVID-19. Remaining in Yukon, Yukon trappers need people to buy their tanned furs. Yukon Trappers Association recognizes this need, and in support of trappers, made arrangements for the venue, so that trappers have a chance to sell their furs,\" explained Yaklin.</p><p>The fur industry has been hurting since COVID-19 began, which has hampered international travel and purchasing. Yaklin explained that sales have been down due to complications with auction houses and closed borders.</p><p>In March this year the Fur Harvesters Auction, the only remaining fur auction house in Canada, delayed their sale as the country closed borders and entered a pandemic lockdown.</p><p>The sale eventually moved online, in an industry first, but sales for western coyote, lynx and bobcat were down compared to the previous year, according to the company's posted numbers.</p><p>The company noted that Italy and Korea &amp;#x26;#8211; at the time two countries hit heavily by the pandemic &amp;#x26;#8211; were major buyers for those products.</p><p>Yaklin said it was a tough event for Yukon sellers.</p><p>\"Buyers couldn't make their purchases by tactile examination of the furs; they just didn't buy,\" Yaklin said. The auction house itself admitted, post-sale, that many buyers were reluctant to make big purchases without inspecting the quality of the goods.</p><p>Online markets have been a solution for some. The Trappers Association is working on restoring the I'm Fur Real campaign and online store that provided a successful way to sell local furs launched in 2018. Other trappers and crafters have been using the website Etsy, which specializes in handmade products, to sell wares.</p><p>In August the auction house hosted an in-person event in North Bay, Ont., but only Canadian buyers could attend. Unsold goods were transferred to an online auction platform. While some species saw a better turnout than the spring auction, many species continued to see low sales.</p><p>\"For Yukon members, sales results were extremely low. Trappers are in their second year of a whammy,\" explained Yaklin.</p><p>Last year, in 2019, the North American Fur Auctions entered creditor protection, a move that is often a precursor to bankruptcy. The Canadian company, one of the largest and oldest auction houses, normally held four sales a year for ranched and wild furs.</p><p>Yaklin said despite the challenges and changes to the tradition, many Yukoners beginning their annual season this year still love the process.</p><p>Some of the traplines in the territory have been passed down through generations &amp;#x26;#8211; and won't be disappearing any time soon.</p><p>\"The most common response to the decreased sales issue is that trappers have to maintain a profession rather than rely only on trapping as a source of income. The lifestyle, however, is too valuable and many simply won't give it up,\" she said.</p><p>Contact Haley Ritchie at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:haley.ritchie@yukon-news.com\">haley.ritchie@yukon-news.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-4074494</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618G-PBF1-JDH1-C3F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tweet falsely attributed to Virginia Tech swimmer</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CLAIM: Reka Gyorgy, a Virginia Tech swimmer, posted from her personal Twitter account a statement saying her finals spot was \u201cstolen\u201d by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, and she encouraged other swimmers to refuse to compete.</p><p>THE FACTS: The tweet did not come from Gyorgy\u2019s account. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press that the user responsible for the tweet was suspended for violating the platform\u2019s policy on the \u201ccreation of fake accounts,\" and multiple representatives from Virginia Tech\u2019s athletics department also said the account was not authentic. The tweet gained more than 28,000 retweets and 101,000 likes before the account was suspended Monday, about a day after the post was made. The critical message came after Thomas, a University of Pennsylvania senior, made history on March 17 as the first transgender woman to win an NCAA swimming championship. Gyorgy had criticized the NCAA rules that allowed Thomas to compete in the women\u2019s division on other platforms, and called for them to be changed in a letter posted publicly to her Facebook account on Sunday afternoon. But the tweet posted hours later under a profile using Gyorgy\u2019s name and photo did not come from an account belonging to her, according to Twitter. \u201cThe account referenced has been permanently suspended for violating our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts,\u201d Twitter wrote in a statement to the AP. Pete Moris, Virginia Tech\u2019s associate athletics director for strategic communications, and Sergio Lopez Miro, women\u2019s swimming and diving head coach, also confirmed that the tweet did not come from Gyorgy. \u201cThe account was fake,\u201d Lopez Miro wrote in an email to the AP. The earliest available record of the now-suspended page was captured on March 20 by the internet archive the WayBack Machine. At that time, the account had posted several retweets supporting Republican politicians dating back to December 2021. The account had not posted any content about swimming or Gyorgy until March 17, when the NCAA women\u2019s swimming championships were underway. Additionally, the same account previously used the handle \u201c@Amanda191923\u201d before changing it to \u201cRekaGyorgy_.\u201d Searches on Twitter for the Amanda username reveal older tweets now linked to the fake Gyorgy account. Before it was deleted, several conservative news outlets and social media users with large followings had retweeted or shared screenshots of the tweet about Thomas, representing it as a genuine post from Gyorgy. Thomas has followed NCAA and Ivy League rules since she began her transition in 2019 by starting hormone replacement therapy, the AP has reported. Gyorgy did not respond to a request for comment via Facebook Messenger.</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Sophia Tulp in Atlanta contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Posts inflate Libyan civilian deaths caused by NATO in 2011</p><p>CLAIM: NATO killed tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of civilians during a 2011 military intervention in Libya.</p><p>THE FACTS: Estimates for how many civilians were killed during the NATO campaign in Libya vary, but experts told The Associated Press that figures placing civilian casualties in the tens of thousands are dramatically inflated. Nongovernmental organizations have also said that far fewer civilians were killed by the NATO airstrikes, with estimates ranging from 72 to 403. After former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi\u2019s regime violently cracked down on anti-government protesters, NATO, with U.N.-backing, conducted a campaign of airstrikes against the regime between March and October of 2011, the AP reported. NATO warplanes conducted more than 9,600  strike missions, and the campaign ended after Gadhafi was ousted and killed. In recent days, widely-circulating social media posts have claimed that NATO forces killed tens of thousands of civilians during the 2011 military intervention. \u201cThe most air strikes ever launched in Africa by NATO was more than 10,000 on Libya in 2011 with over 500,000 Civilian Casualities,\u201d said one tweet. Another Twitter user claimed that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by NATO forces in Libya while comparing the allegation to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cNATO+USA+France killed 55k+ civilians in Libya because they wouldn\u2019t accept the jihadist rule that NATO+Obama admin eventually bombed into power there,\u201d the user wrote on Sunday. \u201cThe Russian people are correct to be terrified of NATO.\u201d No credible estimates support the assertions that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by the 2011 NATO airstrikes in Libya. \u201cThose numbers strike me as wildly off. Wildly exaggerated,\u201d said Daniel Serwer, a professor and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Alan Kuperman, a University of Texas professor whose research focuses include ethnic conflict and military intervention, also told the AP that the claims are \u201cexaggerated by a factor of 100 times or more.\u201d The U.N.-appointed Commission of Inquiry on Libya investigated some of the airstrikes and found that while NATO did not intentionally target civilians, 60 civilians were killed and 55 were wounded, the AP reported in March 2012. Separately, Human Rights Watch concluded in a May 2012 report that at least 72 civilians were killed by NATO airstrikes. In March 2021, Airwars, a group that tracks civilian harm in conflict zones, estimated that NATO strikes caused 223 to 403 likely civilian deaths. Chris Woods, director of Airwars, wrote in an email to the AP that the claims that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by NATO airstrikes is \u201cnot supported by any public claim we are aware of,\" adding that: \u201cThe great majority of civilians killed in Libya in 2011 also died as a result of Gaddafi forces actions.\" In an emailed statement to the AP, NATO Deputy Spokesperson Piers Cazalet declined to confirm the number of Libyan civilians killed by NATO actions in 2011. \u201cEverything possible was done to minimise the risk to civilians, but in a complex military campaign, that risk cannot be reduced to zero,\u201d Cazalet said, adding: \u201cIt is likely some have been affected in the seven months-long campaign. We deeply regret any instance of civilian casualties.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Josh Kelety in Phoenix contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Space Foundation did not strip Russian cosmonaut of honors</p><p>CLAIM: Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first person to go to space 61 years ago, has been stripped of his honors by the Space Foundation because he is Russian.</p><p>THE FACTS: The Space Foundation changed the name of an annual fundraiser that was previously known as \u201cYuri\u2019s Night,\u201d but it didn\u2019t strip Gagarin of any honors. The nonprofit, which advocates for the global space industry, continues to celebrate Gagarin\u2019s accomplishments at events and with a display at its Discovery Center, a spokesman told The Associated Press. The Space Foundation\u2019s decision to rename an annual fundraiser amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was distorted by social media users who falsely claimed the organization stripped Gagarian of official honors. \u201cRussian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space, has been stripped of his honours by the Space Foundation \u2018in light of current events,\u2019\u201d read a tweet, which was shared across platforms in a screenshot. \u201cImagine pretending Neil Armstrong never walked on the moon because the US invaded Iraq decades later,\u201d another post commented. But the Space Foundation isn\u2019t pretending Gagarin wasn\u2019t the first man in space. Instead, it changed the name of an annual fundraiser from \u201cYuri\u2019s Night\u201d to \u201cA Celebration of Space: Discover What\u2019s Next\u201d after its initial social media posts about the April 3 fundraiser elicited negative responses about Russia on social media. \u201cAlmost four weeks ago, we posted about Yuri\u2019s Night and our social media feeds started to feed into a lot of anti-Russian anger,\u201d Rich Cooper, vice president of strategic communications and outreach at the Space Foundation, said in a phone interview with the AP. \u201cWe wanted to not have our social media platforms become any type of venue for hate or animosity against anyone. We changed the name out of respect for that situation.\u201d Cooper said the narrative that the Space Foundation was stripping Gagarin of any honors is \u201ctotally false\u201d and added that \u201cno one can strip away\u201d the honor of being the first person to go to space. The Space Foundation has not conferred specific honors to Gagarian but it has a display for the cosmonaut at its Discovery Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The nonprofit has no plans to stop celebrating Gagarin\u2019s accomplishments in any capacity, Cooper said. In a public statement issued on its website, the Space Foundation said this year\u2019s annual fundraiser will still \u201chighlight Yuri\u2019s flight,\u201d as well as other \u201cspace milestones.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Video shows flight simulator game, not Chinese airliner crash</p><p>CLAIM: Video shows Boeing 737 crash in southern China.</p><p>THE FACTS: The footage is computer generated, and was created using a flight simulator game. A China Eastern Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in a remote mountainous area of southern China on Monday, setting off a forest fire, according to the country\u2019s aviation officials. Following the crash, Twitter users began sharing a video game clip of a plane plummeting from the sky, falsely claiming it showed the China Eastern crash. The footage takes the point of view from a window seat, from which a red, yellow and green Ethiopian Airlines logo can be seen on the plane\u2019s wing. Screams can be heard in the background. \u201cA Boeing 737 just crashed in southern China. This was one of the last moment recorded on the plane. maybe the only moment. Viewers\u2019 discretion advised,\u201d stated one widely-shared Twitter post with the video. The video circulating on social media is identical to a portion of a longer clip posted to YouTube on March 10, 2019. That post states that the footage was made from the flight simulator game X-Plane 11, as an attempt to recreate how an Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed after takeoff in March 2019. \u201cThis is only a simulated flight crash for Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302,\u201d the video\u2019s caption states. In the longer clip, graphics such as the clouds and landscape are clearly computer generated. The plane\u2019s interior also matches video and screenshots of the Boeing 737-800 simulation from X-Plane 11\u2019s website. The 10-minute clip on YouTube shows the aircraft taking off and ends with the plane falling from the sky. The video notes that the screams were edited into the flight simulator footage: \u201cThis sound is added while editing, so this is not implemented from the simulator,\u201d an on-screen caption states. The creator of X-Plane 11 did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed this report. </p><p>___</p><p>Twitter is not placing sex offender notices on profiles</p><p>CLAIM: Twitter has a feature that notifies users if a profile belongs to a registered sex offender.</p><p>THE FACTS: Twitter does not have any such feature. The false claim that the site had implemented a feature warning users when they visit an account created by a registered sex offender spread after a Twitter user created a hoax warning on their profile page to make it seem like Twitter was notifying people about a sex offender on the platform. On Tuesday, a Twitter user posted a screenshot of a different user\u2019s profile page with the caption: \u201cWhen did Twitter start showing that you\u2019re a sex offender ??\u201d A notice on that user\u2019s page featured a man\u2019s photo next to a warning symbol and the text \u201cThis user is a registered sex offender, to learn more visit twitter\u2019s safety policy.\" The tweet suggesting this was an authentic notice received more than 20,000 retweets and 101,000 likes. While some people pointed out that the feature was not legitimate, many others shared the tweet as if the warning was real. But the banner did not show an official notice. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed in a phone call to The Associated Press that the platform has no such feature. The person who posted the false notice used Twitter\u2019s newsletter feature to make a fake warning label. Twitter allows users to create newsletters through its tool Revue, and pin them prominently to their profiles to get people to subscribe. Since a person can type anything to create such a newsletter, this person wrote \u201cthis user is a registered sex offender\u201d and pinned it to their profile. Twitter\u2019s help center states that: \u201ccreators can control the display of the newsletter feature on their Twitter profiles,\u201d but warns, \u201cWe do not permit this feature to be used as \u2018clickbait\u2019 or for promoting external products or services, distributing offers or promotions, or similar activity.\u201d The hoax banner has since been removed from the user\u2019s profile, and the link to Revue now directs to a message saying the newsletter has been suspended. A Twitter spokesperson told the AP on Wednesday that the account that posted the hoax notice was also later permanently suspended for violating a spam policy. The photo of the man that was used has appeared online dozens of times over the years, usually as a meme.</p><p>\u2014 Sophia Tulp </p><p>___</p><p>All states can fly their flags as high as Old Glory, not just Texas</p><p>CLAIM: Texas is the only state whose flag can fly at the same height as the U.S. flag.</p><p>THE FACTS: All state flags can be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag, contrary to a long-running myth that some social media users are sharing. \u201cTexas is the only state whose flag can fly at the same hight as US flag,\u201d says one Facebook post, misspelling height, and featuring images of the Texas and U.S. flags side by side. But no such distinction exists. \u201cAll state flags can be flown at the same height as the US flag, and are routinely flown that way,\u201d Peter Ansoff, president of the North American Vexillological Association, wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

During any other May, Glacier National Park would be abuzz as employees prepare for the busy tourist season that is just a few weeks a way. But this is unlike any other year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Glacier Park has been closed for over a month because of the coronavirus pandemic, and at this point it appears it will remain closed until at least the end of May with a staged opening sometime after that. But when it does finally open, all signs point to it being a summer unlike any other in the park's history. Evidence of that came last week when the Glacier Park Boat Co. announced that it would not open this year. People with reservations for boat rides this summer will be able to transfer their reservation to next summer at a 10% discount or get a full refund.</p><p>This is the first time since World War II that boat tours will not be offered in the park, said Glacier Park Boat Co. owner Scott Burch.</p><p>Burch said he made the decision not to open for a number of reasons, the Flathead Beacon reported. One was that practicing social distancing on a small boat - with just one way on and one way off and a limited number of seats - would be nearly impossible. Rules regarding employee housing in the park meant there wouldn't be enough room for all of his regular employees in the dorms. And even simple tasks like buying a ticket or helping a passenger board a boat would be complicated. There was also the question of whether or not people would want to ride a boat.</p><p>\"Even if the park opens up this summer, no one really knows what the situation will look like,\" he said. \"We're in survival mode, but we're also trying to be socially responsible... I don't want anyone in the Glacier Park Boat Co. to be exposed to the coronavirus.\"</p><p>While the historic boats will not be taking passengers, they will likely be on the water at some point this year, said Operations Manager Tyrel Johnson. That's because if there's a forest fire there is simply no way to protect the boat inside the onshore boathouse.</p><p>\"We can protect a boat in the water, but we can't protect it in the boathouse,\" Johnson said.</p><p>Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts, operator of lodges inside the park as well as the popular Red Bus tours, is also trying to figure out what the 2020 season will look like. Marc Ducharme, general manager for Glacier National Parks Lodges, said if Xanterra does open, it will be a delayed start. The earliest any of its services would begin in the park is June 15. The company previously planned to have the lodges open in May and early June.</p><p>At this point, it's unclear when Glacier Park will open anyway. Superintendent Jeff Mow said reopening the park would be a joint decision with state, tribal and local officials.</p><p>Presently, about 160 people are working in the park, completing essential duties like gillnetting invasive lake trout and taking care of carcasses and other attractants in public places (areas with services and buildings). Officials want to make sure that bears waking up from their winter slumber to a human-less Glacier Park don't get too used to it.</p><p>Mow said that the park would likely be offering fewer services this year than in past years. Because of rules surrounding social distancing, the park and concessioners will not be able to house as many employees as they normally would, and some campgrounds will probably not open at all.</p><p>Work is also continuing to clear the Going-to-the-Sun Road. Mow said it's considered an essential task for a number of reasons, mostly because park officials don't want heavy-tracked equipment to be running directly on bare pavement for fear that it will damage it. But there's also an economic reason.</p><p>\"It's important for us to do what we can for the economic recovery, and everyone I've talked to wants the Sun Road open,\" he said. \"If there is one thing that says 'Glacier National Park is open,' it's having the Sun Road open.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-909569bbc73be04ebeafc33103ff1b59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW1-92G1-JBVR-3309-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><timeReceived>10:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 9, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Baltzer is an associate professor in biology at WLU, and studies the impact of global warming on the boreal forest. For their daughters, it's a holiday in the wilderness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baltzer is known for her research on the effects of wildfires and melting permafrost, processes affected by global warming. Her next research campaign focuses on the response of the boreal forest itself to a warming climate, particularly the trees' ability to capture nutrients in thawing permafrost.</p><p>Baltzer is named Wilfrid Laurier University's Research Professor for 2020-21. The award recognizes her achievement in scholarly excellence, and allows her some time and grant funding to focus on her research. Baltzer is also the Canada Research Chair in Forests and Global Change.</p><p>For Baltzer, the fascinating part of her research is that this vast forest is revealing itself to be a lot more complicated than previously thought. This is important because the boreal forest is the largest terrestrial biome on the planet, and stores about a third of the planet's terrestrial carbon stocks. Changes in the way it functions affects the global climate system.</p><p>Scientists have traditionally treated the boreal as one large forest that behaves uniformly, but Baltzer's research shows that seemingly small differences like species composition of the moss layer or the forest canopy can have large impacts on the way the ecosystem responds to something like a forest fire, either in terms of how intensely it burns, the trajectory of recovery after, or the ability to deal with warming soils.</p><p>\"A lot of the early predictions were that we would see really positive growth responses in boreal forests to a warming climate,\" says Baltzer, \"because these are cold-limited forests, you know they've got cold soils, frozen soils, short growing seasons. And all of these things pointed to the potential for boreal forests to respond very positively, but in fact we see really variable responses. Some parts of the boreal show really negative responses to warming, and others really positive responses.\"</p><p>She won't be able to take her family up to Yellowknife for a summer of field research this year, because of WLU's restrictions on work-related travel due to COVID-19, so she and her team will be focusing on the data sets they already have.</p><p>Baltzer did not set out to become a forest ecologist. \"My plan, as many young biologists plan, was to become a doctor,\" she says. But in her first year at Acadia University she was hired at a lab where an early mentor, Dr. Edward Reekie, trained her in conducting research and her excitement for plant ecology grew.</p><p>She takes satisfaction knowing her work is used to directly shape policy and climate adaptation strategies in the north. She's worked closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to create research frameworks for understanding the boreal's response to fire. She has also worked with the territory to understand how harvesting sections of the boreal for wood pellet production will affect thaw rates of the permafrost.</p><p>\"It's very rewarding as a scientist to be able to work closely with a partner and know that your research is having a direct impact on the ground,\" she says.</p><p>\"The fact that globally we haven't seen more rapid warming, a lot of it has to do with the ability of [the earth's] natural systems to absorb carbon dioxide.

Councillor Bob Day asked during the finance and administration committee meeting last week whether the town is enforcing its backyard burning bylaw.\"</p><p>\"Are we through the education phase and starting to enforce backyard burning?\" he asked.</p><p>\"You have to remember we have a bylaw officer who's here only one day a week,\" replied Joe Fernandez, town administrator, who also suggested using education. \"At the end of the day, it's better.\"</p><p>Ronnie Gill, the town's director of finance, said the police have responded to some bylaw complaints when the bylaw officer hasn't been available. Councillor Tim McGonigle suggested that there definitely should be enforcement of the bylaws.</p><p>\"I think we're moving into more than one day a week of enforcement in the next year or two,\" said Day.</p><p>Mayor Ross Forrest suggested simply changing the bylaw officer's schedule. \"I think that's one of the problems we have in this town, everyone knows when the bylaw officer is here. Perhaps if we just have her come randomly.\"</p><p>25 years ago:</p><p>An unseen fire could have cost lives around this time 25 years ago.</p><p>\"It may have been only a chimney fire, but it could've taken the lives of Roy and Edith Smith in their home at a mobile home park at 9041 Meade Creek Rd., Friday morning,\" reported the front page of the Jan. 25 Lake News. \"The fire was reported by neighbours about 9:30 a.m. The Smiths didn't know their home was a blaze.\"</p><p>\"When they came and told us I said 'it's fine in here I can't smell any smoke,\" said Mrs. Smith. \"I don't know what would've happened if it had been at night when we were all asleep.\"</p><p>The fire had got into the roof by the time firefighters arrived and damage was considerable. It was first noticed by Sylvia Russell and her dad, Peter, who live nearby. Sylvia, a trained forest fire fighter, put her experience into practice, got out the garden hoses and climbed on the roof of the burning structure to contain the flames until firemen arrived.</p><p>40 years ago:</p><p>\"Brent Friday acclaimed 1980 citizen of the year\" was the headline in The Lake News of Jan. 30, 1980.</p><p>\"Brent Friday of Honeymoon Bay whose activities in the community have ranged from Boy Scouts to theater, has been chosen the Cowichan Lake Citizen of the Year for 1979. Friday was honored at the annual Cowichan Lake District Chamber of Commerce banquet Saturday, Jan. 26.\"</p><p>The Citizen of the Year award is given to the person judged, from among people nominated locally, to have contributed most to the community. In his 28 years in the district, Friday has been active or is still active in the Anglican church, Honeymoon Bay Volunteer Fire Department, the Lake Cowichan Drama Club, the Kinsman, the Boy Scouts Association, the school board, the Malaspina College Council, and the Kaatza Historical Society. He has also served as president of the Honeymoon Bay Employees Association. The choice of the outstanding citizen was made by a group of three judges, past Chamber of Commerce president Jim Colwell said.</p><p>The intent of the award, Colwell said, is to honour the nominee who has given the most service to the community, not necessarily in that year alone. It can often reflect years of service, he said, as it did in the case of Brent Friday. The award came as a total surprise to Friday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-3942867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3R-14V1-JDH1-C32R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Cowichan Gazette</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DBAT</classCode><className>MOBILE HOMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000CY7S</classCode><className>TRAILER PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Focused largely on potential impacts in Canada, it makes scant mention of devastating deforestation and fires in the BrazilianAmazon driven by cattle ranching and soy production.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brazil is the region's largest economy and the deal could increase its agricultural exports to Canada by about $10 billion.</p><p>Deforestation in the Amazon increased by 30 per cent in 2019, boosted by the Bolsonaro government's anti-environment agenda. In 2020, more than 12 per cent more fires burned between January and September than last year, covering roughly 1.8 million hectares.</p><p>The region plays a critical ecological role, capturing vast amounts of carbon, regulating the region's climate and hosting some of the planet's most biodiverse ecosystems. It's also home to hundreds of Indigenous nations whose human rights and cultural survival are threatened by deforestation and violence from ranchers and loggers.</p><p>There is \"a possible risk\" of deforestation, soil erosion and biodiversity loss arising from increased agricultural production as a result of the deal, the environmental assessment notes. However, a 2019 report by a coalition of climate and environmental researchers about the situation in Brazil found a close correlation between deforestation, fires and industrial soy production and ranching.</p><p>The document states that the deal would include provisions that \"may ... help mitigate negative (environmental) impacts, notably in relation to ... agricultural practices,\" a note that doesn't convince Scott Sinclair, director of the Trade and Investment Research Project at the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives.</p><p>Sinclair sees no reason this lax approach to environmental and labour regulations would be any different with this agreement, a concern reinforced by recently leaked documents from a similar deal now being negotiated between the European Union and Mercosur countries.</p><p>Environmental violations are not considered \"essential elements\" in that document, meaning that sanctions or other enforcement measures can't be implemented if a country violates the environmental standards outlined in the deal. Similar provisions could easily be included in the proposed Canada-Mercosur deal - a bad sign, especially in light of Brazil's current political situation.</p><p>Brazil's environmental legislation is currently being gutted by the Bolsonaro government, Fick said, with the administration attempting to legalize land grabs of protected areas and Indigenous territories while defunding the country's environmental protection agency.</p><p>And despite thrice mentioning that Canada and Mercosur countries will \"maintain high levels of environmental protection\" and \"improve their (environmental) laws and policies,\" the assessment offers no details on how those legislative standards will be enforced.</p><p>\"It's a perfect storm where the regime is indifferent or even supportive of encroachment on this vital ecosystem to the point where experts think it's threatened with collapse, but somehow that doesn't factor into this environmental assessment,\" said Sinclair. \"If we entered into an agreement with Mercosur ... we'd be sanctioning (and) legitimizing those practices.\"</p><p>This is especially true as the environmental assessment skirts around the direct relationship between the Brazilian government's policies and deforestation and fires driven by agriculture and cattle ranching.</p><p>Instead, it frames the environmental devastation as a technological problem that free trade between Canada and the Mercosur region could help solve by \"broaden(ing) farmers' access to new tools (and) enable(ing) a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, as well as greenhouse gas emissions.\" That's a baseless claim in light of Brazil's current political, social and economic situation, Fick said. Nor is it the only red flags she sees in the document.</p><p>\"The trade and Indigenous Peoples chapter is particularly worrying and disconnected from reality,\" she said.</p><p>The document states that the agreement would \"acknowledge\" the need for Indigenous people and businesses to benefit from the proposed deal and does not include any mention of the current situation for Indigenous people in the country.</p><p>Still, the deal is not yet complete.</p><p>\"There have been no new negotiations since last year's forest fire season in the Amazon. In any potential future negotiations on an investment chapter for a Mercosur free trade agreement, Canada would reaffirm our right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives such as respect for Indigenous peoples, and the protection of the environment,\" said a spokesperson for the office of Mary Ng, minister of small business, international trade, and export promotion in an email.</p><p>\"Indigenous leaders in Brazil are warning that the conditions (in the Amazon) threaten their survival - as land grabbers move into their lands, violence increases and the government refuses to recognize their rights,\" Fick explained.</p><p>The assessment also only considers the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from Canadian companies that might result from increased trade with the region, not the overall rise in emissions from pre-existing trade arrangements or deforestation and forest fires in Brazil. Sinclair explained that such a narrow focus - standard practice for these kinds of environmental assessments - makes it possible to avoid the thornier environmental issues. And it also misses the point.</p><p>\"It misses the big picture. It doesn't look at the impacts of a free trade agreement as an institutional framework that's destroying the Amazon rainforest in Brazil,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020101659152284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6133-03C1-JDH1-C3YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.
