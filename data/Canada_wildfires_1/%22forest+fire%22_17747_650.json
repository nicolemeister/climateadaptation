Previously, it was a deputy and an assistant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The assistant chief reported to the deputy chief, and then the deputy chief reported to the fire chief. Fire Chief Alle Jan de Vries said the reorganization has made things smoother.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He is proud of their provincial reputation and ongoing efforts to improve training and response capabilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">De Vries has been with Smithers Fire Rescue since 2013 and was deputy chief for almost three years before being promoted to the top job late last year.</p><p>Previous to that, he worked for Raven Rescue after making a move up north from Squamish for a more affordable lifestyle.</p><p>The rescue side of things was always a passion for him, before structural firefighting was on his radar.</p><p>Now, he can combine the two and is enjoying being chief.</p><p>\"It's been great so far, and being able to fill out the management team here with the deputy chiefs has been a great step,\" he said. \"And then, as well, just working with the crew. Some of our firefighters have been with us for over 40 years, and some have been with us for four months. Keeping the senior people engaged, and getting the new people trained, it's always an interesting balance.\"</p><p>One of his most recent hires is Sean Rowell, who went from being a lawyer to deputy fire chief last month.</p><p>He was volunteering with the fire department for 18 years while also a partner in a law firm.</p><p>Rowell said he feels the roles are similar, and it is all about the people.</p><p>\"They're both pretty high-stress, high-paced environments, so being able to work with a team in both of those roles, it's not that different. It feels different. But really, when you get down to it, it's about people and people performance.\"</p><p>He has always been a part of both worlds. Even in law school, he was a wildland firefighter. But he is now hanging up his robes to focus on just being a part of the fire department.</p><p>\"It was sort of waking up and realizing where my passion was, where I wanted to be, and where I thought I could make a bit of a difference,\" Rowell said. \"There was an opening here that seemed to meet everything that I've worked towards. I'm really passionate about coaching people, I am a volunteer coach in my spare time, and this felt like just fitting into that.\"</p><p>The other deputy fire chief is also head of the local Emergency Support Services, and also able to blend his passions into one job.</p><p>Matt Herzog was living in the Yukon, where he went to pursue a different career path that didn't work out. Then he made a serendipitous trip to Smithers. He started working at a ski shop and was hoping to volunteer with the ambulance service because he had some previous experience in that area.</p><p>However, the service didn't take volunteers and they sent him over to the fire department. That was 15 years ago. In 2021, he started off as the assistant chief and then, in 2024, became the deputy chief for planning and prevention.</p><p>He agreed with Rowell and de Vries that it is the people who make the job great.</p><p>\"Going on the calls and everything is really great, but the relationships that we get to develop and foster and train new people is what I think I love the most,\" he said.</p><p>\"I get to work with 40-plus firefighters here, and then I have another 40 volunteers with the Emergency Support Services program. I get to have a really diverse relationship with people, and then develop response capacity regionally, so for the fire department within our community here, and then with emergency support services, developing that regional response capacity with partners across the province. With emergency support services, now we can do a lot of stuff remotely with the air program, so we can support evacuees from all over British Columbia, so we do a lot of that here.\"</p><p>He also noted that the fire department is well-rounded, lucky to have three chiefs and a diverse volunteer group of firefighters. He said there are some pros to having a volunteer department, over a career department fully staffed with professional firefighters.</p><p>\"We have some very technical people. We have plumbers and electricians, engineers, we've got all kinds of people in the department to help us strategize and make solutions to calls,\" Herzog said.</p><p>\"Recently, we were on a call, that was very tactical and complex, and between everyone on the call, we all had different ideas that we could put together to complete this very complicated extrication that we needed to do. So we had some people that were really concentrating doing the medical part, and we had people that were engineers and very good at just being knick-knacky, and we were able to put together a really safe and unique way to extricate somebody.\"</p><p>De Vries added that is a huge part of what he loves about the department.</p><p>\"One of the things I would say that gives me pride in this department and that I'm really proud of, is how well the fire department and ESS are both regarded provincially. When I talk to people and tell them I'm from Smithers, often people have good things to say about their interactions, whether it is due to response where we've deployed to other locations or even where other outside providers have come in and offered us training. This is me standing on the shoulders of all those who came before me, but I can't really claim any of it, or a huge amount of it, it's just historically Smithers Fire, and our ESS, which is in its current model are both regarded very well around the province from other organizations, which gives me a ton of pride.\"</p><p>Going into forest fire season, having that good provincial reputation will benefit Smithers and the surrounding area.</p><p>Smithers Fire Rescue has sent crews around British Columbia over the years, something Rowell said will help the community in the future.</p><p>\"If that ever happens, a situation comes to our door, we'll have had experience helping others deal with it. And every time we go, other crews from across the province are coming, and they're bringing their ideas and going, this is what works for us, this helped us. And we're picking up on those things, we're trying those things, we're seeing, if they work for us as well,\" he said. \"We're going to be better because the folks around us are better, and we're going to be better because we've made those efforts.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 Smithers Interior News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-news20250606PIN4732325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G07-48M3-RRRC-J0Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

There is none.\"</p><p>As of Thursday\u00a0(the most recent update from the province), there were 22 active wildfires in Manitoba. There have been a total of 103 already this season, far\u00a0above the province's 20-year annual average of 80\u00a0at this time of year.</p><p>More than 17,000 people are being evacuated from northern, western\u00a0and eastern regions of the province.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation_fire/Fire-Maps/fireview/fireview.html\">Manitoba FireView</url> map includes locations, sizes and other information about the wildfires.</p><p>In Flin Flon, water bombers haven't been able to help, because it's too smoky for them to fly, Fontaine said.</p><p>\"So, you know, everybody has to be gone, and then\u00a0we're going to have to just see what nature does,\" he said. \"Everyone's really fearful.\"</p><p/><p>The vast majority of the city of about 5,000 in northwestern Manitoba was cleared out on Wednesday.\u00a0Some members of city council and some civic employees and emergency responders had remained to monitor\u00a0things and give updates on social media.</p><p>The winds had been favourable on Thursday, pushing the flames away from the city, but that's about to change and everyone must get out today, Fontaine said.</p><p>\"The wind isn't set to shift to later in the day, so that should give us time to drive out.\u00a0Once we drive away, that's it. I'm not sure when we'll be able to come back in here -\u00a0when or if,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't want to sugarcoat anything.\u00a0I'd love to be back on the ...

But at this particular point in time, you know, it's not looking good at all.\"</p><p>And there's only one way out for those who remain. The road to the west, across the border into Creighton, Sask., is blocked by the fire, and Highway 10 to The Pas is also blocked by flames now.</p><p>The latter route was the one evacuees took out of Flin Flon on Thursday.</p><p>\"So we have to head from where we are to Snow Lake and then down south towards Grand Rapids and to Winnipeg\u00a0that way,\" Fontaine said.</p><p>At this point, he doesn't know if anyone in Flin Flon\u00a0has decided to ignore evacuation orders and hide.

The declaration includes prisoner exchanges and restoring state authority, setting the stage for a final peace deal by Aug. 18.

A U.S.-brokered ceasefire has brought cautious calm, allowing humanitarian aid convoys to enter the area. The fighting between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouins killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people. Sectarian violence, including targeted attacks on Druze civilians, escalated tensions. Government forces intervened but were perceived as supporting the Bedouins. Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa urged the Bedouins to respect the ceasefire and leave. The U.N. and U.S. have called for an end to hostilities, warning the violence threatens Syria\u2019s fragile postwar recovery. Tensions remain high.</p><p>WORDS: 848 - MOVED: 07/20/2025 9:46 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:4da2410d00a298a7fde9f508ea9ece17&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:4da2410d00a298a7fde9f508ea9ece17&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>AS--SOUTH KOREA-HEAVY RAIN</p><p>Heavy rains in South Korea leave 17 dead and 11 others missing</p><p>SUMMARY: Torrential rains in South Korea over five days have caused 17 deaths and left 11 people missing, officials report. On Sunday, one person died in a house collapse, and another was swept away by a swollen stream in Gapyeong. Heavy downpours triggered landslides and flash floods in Sancheong, killing 10 and leaving four missing. Earlier in the week, incidents like floodings and a collapsed overpass wall claimed additional lives. As of Sunday afternoon, about 2,730 people remain evacuated.

Officials said the 453 pounds of drugs worth $22 million were stashed in sealed bags inside suitcases. Those arrested were a Congolese diplomat accredited in Belgium, a Belgian citizen and a Bulgarian driver. Prosecutors say they face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of drug trafficking.

It\u2019s less than 22 weeks before Christmas, and American businesses that make and sell consumer goods usually nail down their holiday orders and prices at this time of year. But President Donald Trump\u2019s vacillating tariffs on imported goods have complicated the process. The consequences for consumers? Stores may not have the specific gift items customers want come November and December. Some retail suppliers and buyers scaled back their holiday lines. Businesses still are finalizing their prices but say shoppers can expect many popular products to cost more, though by how much depends partly on whether Trump\u2019s latest round of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs kicks in Aug. 1.</p><p>WORDS: 1260 - MOVED: 07/20/2025 10:47 a.m. EDT</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:ad783aec433e8e4e03480afc338eae39&amp;mediaType=text\">https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=itemid:ad783aec433e8e4e03480afc338eae39&amp;mediaType=text</url></p><p>___</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>AS--INDONESIA-MALAYSIA-HAZE</p><p>Forest fire haze from Indonesia detected in Malaysia</p><p>SUMMARY: Haze from forest and peatland fires in Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra island has reached Malaysia, officials said Sunday. Fires are an annual issue in Indonesia, often straining relations with neighboring countries. Riau province remains heavily affected, with over 140 fires reported, though this is down from 294 on Saturday. Thick haze has reduced visibility in some areas to one kilometer. Satellite data shows the haze moving northeast into Malaysia\u2019s Negeri Sembilan state. Authorities blame plantation owners and farmers for illegal land-clearing fires.

The pope expressed \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d over Thursday\u2019s Israeli attack on Gaza\u2019s only Catholic church, which killed three people and injured 10, including the parish priest.

OF A BORDER STATE IS IN CANADA TO TRY TO WIN THEM BACK.<br/>MAINE IS PRACTICALLY SURROUNDED BY CANADA AND TODAY GOVERNOR JANET MILLS IS IN NOVA SCOTIA AFTER SPENDING TWO DAYS IN NEIGHBORING NEW BRUNSWICK.</p><p><br/>MILLS TOOK QUESTIONS FROM CANADIANS AT AN EVENT WITH NEW BRUNSWICK PREMIER SUSAN HOLT YESTERDAY.<br/>BUT EVEN WHILE SITTING NEXT TO THE GOVERNOR, HOLT WAS BLUNT ABOUT THE BARRIERS TO TOURISM.<br/>   UNTIL CANADIANS FEEL LIKE IT IS A SAFE ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S., WHERE THERE IS BOTH RESPECT, THE ECONOMIC BALANCE HAS BEEN RESTORED, I THINK OUR PRIME MINISTER SAID IT WELL WHEN HE SAID THE RELATIONSHIP HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED AND YOU DON'T BOUNCE BACK FROM THAT OVERNIGHT.<br/>THINGS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE U.S. FOR US TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT CHOOSING TO GO SPEND OUR MONEY THERE RIGHT NOW.<br/>   DAVID: MAINE GOVERNOR JANET MILLS JOINS ME NOW.<br/>GOVERNOR MILLS, IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.<br/>THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY.<br/>   GOOD TO MEET YOU, DAVID.<br/>EVEN REMOTELY.<br/>   IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME FOR OUR TWO COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW.<br/>DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFFS, HIS COMMENTS ABOUT MAKING CANADA A STATE, IT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE STAYING HOME AND NOT SPENDING MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.<br/>WHY ARE YOU ARGUING CANADIANS SHOULD LOOK PAST THAT AND VISIT MAINE?<br/>   LOOK, WE HAVE A DEEP SEEDED INTERRELATIONSHIP -- BOTH COMMERCIAL, FAMILIAL, AND CULTURAL.<br/>MAINE, IN PARTICULAR, HAS -- MANY MAINERS IF NOT THE MAJORITY OF MAINERS HAVE SOME CANADIAN ROOTS.<br/>I MYSELF HAVE ROOTS THAT GO BACK TO PUGWASH, NOVA SCOTIA.<br/>THE MILLS' ARE BURIED IN PUGWASH.<br/>THOSE WHO DIDN'T COME ACROSS IN 1843 TO STONEINGTON, MAINE, AND SETTLE THERE.<br/>THAT IS TYPICAL OF PEOPLE OF MAINE HAVING CONNECTIONS AND ACROSS -- CROSS-BORDER CONNECTIONS.<br/>PEOPLE GO BUY GROCERIES IN EDMUNDTON AND WORK IN MADAWASKA AND THE SAME WITH HOLTON AND WOODSTOCK AND THE CROSS-BORDER CONNECTIONS ARE DEEP AND VERY LASTING.<br/>AND OUR IMPORT-EXPORT TRADE IS VIBRANT, AS WELL.<br/>I HAVE TOURED SOME FACILITIES TODAY AND COMPARED NOTES WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN MAINE IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH OF OFF-SHORE WIND, RESEARCH ON THE MARITIME INDUSTRIES, AND SCIENCE -- COASTAL SCIENCE.<br/>WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY.<br/>ALL THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING.<br/>YOU CAN'T TARIFF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY -- THOUGHTS, IDEAS, AND INNOVATION.<br/>THOSE ARE THINGS WE KEEP SHARING REGARDLESS OF TARIFFS OR THE TALK OF TARIFFS.<br/>   DAVID: IT SEEMS THIS PRESIDENT, IF HE COULD FIND A WAY TO DO THAT, HE MIGHT, THE LONG DEEP PERSONAL CONNECTIONS YOU JUST LISTED OFF, GOVERNOR, THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE CANADIANS TAKE IT SO PERSONALLY.<br/>WHY SHOULDN'T THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY HERE THAN IN MAINE, FOR EXAMPLE?<br/>   IT'S PERSONAL TO US, AND IT'S OFFENSIVE TO US FOR ANYONE TO OFFEND OUR GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS IN CANADA.<br/>WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS MAINE WHO HISTORICALLY DEPENDED ON CANADIAN TOURISM, CANADIAN TRAFFIC.<br/>AND I'VE TALKED WITH SOME OF THEM WHO GO BACK 300 YEARS RUNNING A B AND B OR RESTAURANT.<br/>AND SO WHEN PEOPLE STOP COMING TO MAINE, PARTICULARLY FROM CANADA, FROM THE MARITIME PROVINCES, THEY'RE NOT HURTING DONALD TRUMP.<br/>THEY'RE NOT HURTING THE POWERS THAT BE IN WASHINGTON.<br/>THEY'RE HURTING THEIR FRIENDS HERE IN MAINE WHOSE BUSINESSS THRIVE AND DEPEND ON CANADIAN TRAFFIC.<br/>AND THAT IS DISAPPOINTING.<br/>YOU'RE NOT SENDING A MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON.<br/>YOU'RE ONLY HURTING YOUR FRIENDS AND POTENTIALLY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN MAINE.<br/>   DAVID: RIGHT.<br/>BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A -- A NOT DISSIMILAR SITUATION HERE IN CORE INDUSTRIES.<br/>THE STEEL INDUSTRY HAS LOST ABOUT 700, 800 JOBS WITH THE TARIFFS, AND THE AUTO SECTOR LOST THOUSANDS OF JOBS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE BEEN UPENDED BY THE CIRCULAR FIRING SQUAD OF A TRADE WAR THAT YOUR PRESIDENT HAS STARTED.<br/>SO -- LIKE -- THERE MAY BE NO QUARREL WITH THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MAINE, BUT HOW DO YOU EXPECT CANADIANS TO SUPPORT THE CANADIAN ECONOMY WHEN IT'S BEEN THE ONE THAT'S BEEN PUT ON THE ROPES BY THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT?<br/>   WELL, BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE OR PREDICTED OR PROPOSED TO DO IN THE WAY OF TARIFFS IS ALSO HURTING US MORE DEEPLY EVEN.<br/>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL PUT IT THIS WAY AT THE END OF MARCH, AN HELDER TOIAL SAID THE TARIFFS -- EDITORIALS ARE NOTHING BUT A TAX.<br/>A LARGE TAX HEIST, AND THE TAX IS ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.<br/>AND SO IT'S NOTHING BUT A BUILD-UP OF REVENUES TO THE FEDERAL BUDGET.<br/>YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY, IT'S US WHO HE IS HURTING BY DOING THAT.<br/>I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT OUR CONGRESSIONAL TELL IMMIGRATIONS ACROSS -- DELEGATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL STAND UP TO THIS.<br/>IT IS CONGRESS THAT OWNS THE ABILITY TO TARIFF AND IMPOSE TARIFF OR TAXES AND THEY NEED TO TAKE THAT BACK.<br/>WE'RE ALSO IN THE COURTS FIGHTING HIM ON TARIFFS AND MANY OTHER THINGS.<br/>AND WE'RE WINNING IN THE FEDERAL COURTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON MANY, MANY ISSUES.<br/>I THINK WE'LL WIN ON THE TARIFF ISSUE, TOO.<br/>I THINK WHAT HE IS DOING IS NOT LAWFUL, FRANKLY.<br/>CONGRESS HAS SHOWN NO REAL URGENCY IN REASSERTING ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL OVER TRADE JUST BECAUSE OF THE CAPTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN CONGRESS.<br/>BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE TRADE STUFF, GOVERNOR, THAT IS STOPPING A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM GOING THERE AND THEN THERE IS THE IMMIGRATION AND BORDER ISSUES, AS WELL.<br/>RIGHT.<br/>WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE GETTING DEPORTED TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT THEIR COUNTRY AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT ACADEMICS AND OTHERS BEING SEARCHED AT THE BORDER AND FINDING SOMETHING ON THEIR PHONE THAT A BORDER OFFICER DOESN'T LIKE AND THEY'RE DETAINED OR THEY'RE DENIED ENTRY.<br/>IT SEEMS LIKE A BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN JUST THE TRADE DISPUTE LIMITING PEOPLE.<br/>   THAT'S TRUE.<br/>THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES AT PLAY HERE.<br/>BUT HONESTLY THE BORDER STORIES -- MOST OF THEM -- ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER OR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM THAT IS A VISA ISSUE.<br/>BUT BETWEEN CANADA AND MAINE, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM CANADA INTO MAINE ALL THE TIME, PASSING BACK AND FORTH.<br/>AND THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN AN ISSUE AND WE WELCOME PEOPLE FROM CANADA.<br/>WE BELIEVE THEY ARE SAFE IN MAINE.<br/>MAINE, REMEMBER, HAS THE HIGH -- HAS THE LOWEST VIOLENT CRIME RATE IN THE COUNTRY.<br/>WE VALUE VERMONT FOR THAT.<br/>WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SAFE STATE.<br/>AND THEY SHOULDN'T FEAR THAT COMING TO MAINE ANY MORE THAN MAINE PEOPLE SHOULD FEAR GOING TO WESTERN CANADA AND GETTING STUCK IN A FOREST FIRE -- IT'S REALLY NOT REASONABLE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY FEEL WELCOME AND SAFE COMING TO NEW ENGLAND AND COMING TO MAINE, IN PARTICULAR.<br/>SO WE HAVE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND THEY ARE CROSS-BORDER RELATIONSHIPS THAT GO BACK CENTURIES.<br/>AND WE NEED TO REAFFIRM THOSE.<br/>REAFFIRM OUR FRIENDSHIPS, AND REAFFIRM OUR TRADE RELATIONSHIPS AND MOVE ON TO THE FUTURE.<br/>   WHAT IS THE HIT BEEN ON YOUR ECONOMY SO FAR?<br/>I MEAN DO YOU HAVE A DOLLAR VALUE, JOB VALUE SORT OF QUANTUM?<br/>TOURISM TOWNS ARE GETTING HAMMERED HAMMERED.<br/>   I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE GETTING REALLY HAMMER.<br/>WE HAD A SUCCESSFUL LONG WEEKEND WITH ROAD TRAFFIC, AND THE FEBRUARY TO APRIL FROM CANADA WAS DOWN 26%.<br/>THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES COMING TO MAINE, AS WELL.<br/>BUT ROAD TRAFFIC WAS DOWN ABOUT 26%.<br/>THAT'S DOWN FROM 800,000 PEOPLE LAST YEAR -- CANADIANS COMING TO MAINE.<br/>BUT THAT NEED NOT CONTINUE.<br/>I KNOW A LOT OF CANADIANS ARE STILL COMING TO MAINE TO GO SKIING THIS COMING WINTER.<br/>A LOT OF CANADIANS ARE COMING TO GO LEAF PEEPING IN THE FALL.<br/>A LOT OF CANADIANS STILL COMING TO THE BEACH AND QUEBECOIS ALWAYS WELCOME TO THEIR HISTORIC VACATION SPOT AND OTHER PLACES, AND ACADIA NATIONAL PARK WHICH IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE FROM NOVA SCOTIA BY WAY OF THE CAT.<br/>PEOPLE ARE COMING AND SHOULD BE SAFE.<br/>   GOVERNOR, AS A FINAL POINT, WE'RE A WEEK OR SO INTO A 30-DAY TIMELINE THAT PRIME MINISTER MARK CARNEY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SET FOR RESOLVING THE LATEST TRADE DISPUTE WHEN THEY MET FACE-TO-FACE AT THE G7 IN KANANASKIS IN ALBERTA.<br/>BUT, YOU KNOW, IF IT ISN'T AGREED TO OR RESOLVED BY THEN, AND CANADA WILL HIT BACK WITH TARIFFS EFFECTIVE THE 21ST OF JULY ON STEEL AND OTHER THINGS.<br/>WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN AS A GOVERNOR IF THINGS DON'T GET RESOLVED IN THE COUPLE OF WEEKS LEFT IN THIS?<br/>MAINE LIKE OTHER STATES IS DEPENDENT ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM, THINGS THAT ALREADY HAVE A TARIFF RIGHT NOW, AND OUR CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE GONE UP BY ABOUT 10% ALONE IN RECENT MONTHS.<br/>THAT'S HURTFUL.<br/>OTHER STATES ARE SEEING THE SAME THING.<br/>OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE TARIFFS, RETALIATORY TARIFFS AND I HOPE THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR NEW PRIME MINISTER'S EFFORTS, AND DEVELOPING A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PRESIDENT.<br/>I HOPE IT'S SUCCESSFUL AND PRODUCTIVE, AND I THINK IT WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES TO STOP THE TALK ABOUT TARIFFS.<br/>AGAIN, IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY THE CONGRESS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE TARIFFS AND TAXES.<br/>THEY NEED TO TAKE BACK THE AUTHORITY.<br/>THOSE -- THERE WAS AN EFFORT THAT WAY A COUPLE MONTHS AGO IN THE SENATE, AND CAME VERY CLOSE TO PASSING.<br/>NOW WE NEED TO WORK ON THE HOUSE, AS WELL.<br/>   THE CANADA-U.S. RELATIONSHIP ECONOMICALLY HAS ARGUABLY THE MOST

But with the threat of rising temperatures from\u00a0climate change,\u00a0there are concerns wildfires will grow in frequency and intensity.\u00a0</p><p>Fighting wildfires is usually done by\u00a0firefighters hired or contracted by Ontario or other\u00a0provincial governments -\u00a0and in worse cases the Canadian Armed Forces help out.</p><p>But giving residents\u00a0the capacity to respond as well is something that could reduce the impact of wildfires, says Jason Thistlethwaite, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo's school of environment.</p><p>Mobilizing more people would benefit communities, he says, because despite the province's firefighting capabilities and Canada's strong interprovincial coordination efforts, it can be difficult to deploy all the necessary personnel and equipment quickly when there are multiple large-scale emergencies.</p><p>\"Canada is a big country. You're not going to have people everywhere you need it,\"\u00a0Thistlethwaite said</p><p>For example, teaching volunteers how to create a fire break - a space between a nearby fire and a property by removing vegetation - and how to\u00a0use\u00a0equipment\u00a0available locally can help mitigate destruction,\u00a0Thistlethwaite says.\u00a0</p><p>The problem is that responders and municipalities have issued advice against it because of the liability concerns, he said.\u00a0</p><p>Youth workshops available</p><p>In some First Nation communities,\u00a0some youth are already joining workshops that teach\u00a0fire management, climate change adaptation, and community safety.</p><p>It's an initiative that has ramped\u00a0up through<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2025/03/canada-strengthens-wildfire-response-through-training0.html\">recent federal investments</url>. One program aimed at educating youth by the Keewaytinook Okimakanak\u00a0(KO) tribal council will educate 15 to 19 year olds from\u00a0six First Nations.<br/><br/> The workshop aims to understand the \"what, how, and why\" of fire management, focusing on community desires to re-engage in wildfire management, says\u00a0Michael Morrison,\u00a0a wildfire and climate change youth engagement specialist and interim emergency management coordinator with the KO Tribal Council.</p><p>\"It's fair to say that in the next 10, 20, 30 years, the wildfire environment in Ontario is going to be far different than what we've seen in the previous 30 years, so these youth and people like them are going to be\u00a0faced with addressing some of this,\" Morrison said.</p><p>\"It's really now or never.\"</p><p>The workshop could be an \"excellent\" model for future programs, says David Pearson, professor emeritus of natural sciences at Laurentian University.</p><p/><p>\"It's building the capacity to prepare for and to be ready for wildfires that catch you by surprise,\" he said.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/> A spokesperson from Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources, said\u00a0that the government works closely with First Nations Communities, municipalities, and other communities to coordinate fire response, promote safety, awareness, prevention, and education in their respective communities across Ontario.</p><p>\"We are also working with existing Tribal Councils to train local fire crews and look for more opportunities to help train and set up fire teams in more communities,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0</p><p>It also noted that\u00a0this year, the province\u00a0expects to have\u00a0about 650 FireRangers\u00a0working across\u00a0140 crews, plus\u00a0up to 320 additional firefighting personnel from private contractors.\u00a0</p><p>A Natural Resources Canada spokesperson said in an email on Friday that it delivers a number of programs aimed at supporting efforts to reduce wildfire risks and to enhance preparedness. </p><p>These programs include the Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate equipment and training funds.</p><p>The first provides $256 million\u00a0to assist provinces and territories in procuring firefighting equipment, while the second\u00a0provides $28 million\u00a0to train additional firefighters and enhance community capacity for responding to and managing wildfires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experts stress need for prevention,\u00a0fireproofing</emphasis></p><p>While many wildfires are the result of severe weather mixed with dry vegetation, something that's been exacerbated by climate change, up to 80 per cent of spring blazes are caused by people, Pearson said, and precautionary measures go beyond just putting out a campfire properly.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you drive an ATV through tall dry grass, the grass will smoulder after simply being heated by the passing of the motor. That's how careful we have to be,\" he said.</p><p>There's also a need for people to fireproof their properties as best they can following<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/firesmart\">Ontario's FireSmart program</url>, says Isabelle Chenard, a fire information officer for the northeast.</p><p>\"Forest fire embers can travel up to two kilometres ahead of a fire under certain conditions, so it's really important to limit the amount of combustible material in and around your home,\" she said.</p><p/><p>The FireSmart<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>recommendations range from small steps, such as removing combustible materials from your deck, to bigger projects, such as reducing the amount of shrubs, trees and dead vegetation within 10 metres of buildings.</p><p>\"There's a lot you can do before we get to a situation where we're dealing with wildfire risk,\" Thistlethwaite said, noting incentives from different levels of government and insurance companies could encourage more people to take up those best practices.<br/><br/> Plus, at this point in Ontario's wildfire season, it's too early to predict how the rest of it\u00a0will pan out, he adds.\u00a0</p><p>\"Response is always going to be a challenge, but we can do a lot before we need to bring in [a]<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>response,\" Thistlethwaite said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadatorontowildfireresponsetrainingontario17533950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FV3-TBF3-RWS0-N2YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Continuing to deal in isolation with problems like flood mitigation risks unnecessary expense and ineffective outcomes. But by adopting integrated watershed management (IWM), we will be able to adapt to increasing flood risks while also considering forest fire prevention, land development pressure, community health and the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The terms \"water management\" and \"watershed management\" are used interchangeably all too often by our citizens, citizen scientists, municipal employees and politicians. But there's a big difference and it is important that watershed management be implemented first.</p><p>Water management is just that - managing water, or attempting to manage water, for our use as it moves through our major rivers and lakes. MRWMP is water management. But water management is just one component of IWM, which is much broader.</p><p>The Muskoka River system has 42 dams, constructed starting in the late 1800s to transport logs and facilitate commercial navigation. Power production started in 1894 and hydro-generating stations owned by five separate power companies now exist on 11 of those dams, along with several control dams operated by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR).</p><p>The MRWMP was put in place in 2006 by MNR to manage power production by putting operational limitations on the dams that allow for recreational navigation and seasonal fish spawning.</p><p>While the system has some limited capacity to mitigate a flood, neither the network of dams nor the water management plan were designed for flood control.</p><p>The dams in the Muskoka River system are \"run-of-river\" operations, in that they only pass the natural flows that they receive from upstream in the river system and they have limited or no ability to store water, whether for power generation or flood control. There are also no reservoirs for storage. In a flood scenario, the purpose of the MRWMP is to maintain the integrity of the structures, equitably distribute flood flows where possible and provide flood relief wherever storage is available.</p><p>Furthermore, the MRWMP only deals with water once it has entered our major rivers and lakes with no external considerations, except data from several snow monitoring stations and weather forecasts. It ignores the ways in which water moves through the 5,100 sq. km of forests, towns, farmlands, small lakes, wetlands and headwater streams in the Muskoka River watershed. The MRWMP does not include water quality, terrestrial ecology, land use planning and ecosystem functions beyond several wetland and fish spawning targets.</p><p>An IWM approach considers human and ecological functions across the entire watershed. It provides a tool or framework to help us decide how to manage our land use activities while dealing with issues such as floods and maintaining our high quality environment and socio-economic prosperity.</p><p>IWM considers all sources of floods, including our forests, wetlands and smallest headwater stream systems. It also looks at how water, and its movement through the landscape, supports all of the natural features we depend on. And these aspects of water movement are intrinsically tied to many environmental services that our economy and livelihoods depend on.</p><p>With a collaborative watershed planning system, we can set socio-economic and ecological goals for our watershed that best address key issues such as floods, water quality problems, forest fire prevention and climate adaptation. Local land use decisions include watershed-wide, multi-disciplinary opportunities.</p><p>The differences between water management and watershed management become clear if we consider making changes to our watershed to alleviate floods. If we attempt to address flooding in isolation, and without a full understanding of how the whole watershed system functions with our communities, we won't actually know what changes to make, what infrastructure to build or where to build it without significant risk to our socio-economic future. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2025022274610842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCF-DKV3-S6YF-44SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It also comes with an evacuation order for residents of Adam's Cove north of Cave Lane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The RCMP has\u00a0closed the road between Adam's Cove and Western Bay, telling residents to travel\u00a0south toward Victoria or north toward Lower Island Cove. Newfoundland Power also cut electricity in nearby Ochre Pit Cove, Burnt Point and Kingston.</p><p>Rest stops have since been set up at Persalvic Elementary School in Victoria and the AYLA building in Lower Island Cove for those who are unable to return to their homes.</p><p>Bernie Judge and Ruth Riome,\u00a0residents of Adam's Cove, fled earlier in the evening.</p><p>\"This is about as bad as it gets ... in a beautiful little place like this,\" Bernie Judge, a resident of Adam's Cove, told CBC News Wednesday night.</p><p>Wildfires cropped up across the Avalon Peninsula throughout Wednesday, the most dangerous of which is in\u00a0Small Point-Adam's Cove-Blackhead-Broad Cove in Conception Bay North. Residents of the area who spoke with CBC News described large flames and black smoke that crossed roads.</p><p>Judge said there was a fire in the same area on Tuesday, but fire crews were able to handle it. On Wednesday, things were different.</p><p>\"This one got out of control, and it's after jumping the road. We're pretty sure there's some buildings, homes, lost. And we're just hoping that ours is still in place,\" he said.</p><p>\"It just feels really surreal,\" Riome added.</p><p>Earlier in the day, provincial forest fire duty officer Jeff Motty told CBC News the fire is big, very active and out of control\u00a0-\u00a0and that homes had\u00a0been \"ignited.\"</p><p/><p>Fire crews remain on scene, he said in an update at around 8:30 p.m. NT Wednesday, and that multiple water bombers had been deployed.</p><p>Judge and Riome said people had to act fast once the decision to evacuate had been made. Riome said she scrambled to help her neighbour collect her valuables.</p><p>\"I went over with her and collected the pictures off the walls of her house,\" Riome said. \"Then I went to get Bernie, and they wouldn't let us back in again.\"</p><p>Judge was out of Adam's Cove at the time, but hurried back to save his dogs and cat. He said he convinced a police officer to take him back to his home so his pets could be saved.</p><p/><p>\"I've always been really concerned that if there was a fire, there could be some imminent danger to us. But you just never think that would happen,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is everything. This is our retirement....\u00a0We love this place.\"</p><p>Fires still burn in Fermuse and Holyrood</p><p>There are also two active fires burning in Fermuse and Holyrood.</p><p>Motty said a helicopter and ground crews were on the scene in Fermuse. A cabin was impacted by the fire, but he had no further information as to whether it was occupied. The fire was burning out of control as of Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>The fire near Holyrood is in the Hardings Pond area. The province's wildfire dashboard says it's one hectare in size as of 9\u00a0p.m.</p><p>Crews also responded earlier\u00a0on Wednesday to a fire at Joe's Lake, northwest of Badger. It was 25 per cent contained as of Wednesday afternoon, Motty said, but hotspots still remained following the use of a water bomber.</p><p/><p>At 9 p.m. Wednesday, the\u00a0dashboard reported the fire was zero hectares in size.</p><p>In total, five fires were reported on Wednesday afternoon on the Avalon Peninsula alone. One in St. John's behind the Johnson Geo Centre\u00a0and another in the Paradise area.\u00a0</p><p>Motty says they have been designated as out.</p><p>\"We're getting some warm temperatures right now and it's nice that we're coming out of winter. But, you know, the vegetation on the ground is very dry,\" he said.</p><p>\"It, like, only takes an hour or an hour-and-a-half of those grasses ... to become very ignitable.\"</p><p>Smoke from the fires led Environment Canada to issue a special air quality statement. The statement covers St. John's and the surrounding area and the northern Avalon Peninsula.</p><p>Those who are more susceptible to outdoor air pollution, like those over 65, pregnant or with existing illness, should reduce outdoor time and seek medical attention if experiencing symptoms, the statement said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our\u00a0</emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

Principal Crystal Dawn-Langton said outdoor education transforms learning into an exciting outdoor adventure. This is especially important among children in Kindergarten and Grade 1, Dawn-Langton noted.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Tammi Varney\u2019s kindergarten class takes full advantage of this emphasis on place-based learning, often venturing into the local park for purposeful lessons. This beautiful park serves as a vibrant extension of the classroom, where children engage with the natural world and discover the stories of the land,\u201d Dawn-Langton said. \u201cWe hold deep gratitude for this precious space, which enhances their learning experience.\u201d</p><p>On Thursday, April 3 Varney\u2019s class was putting this philosophy into action, heading to Centennial Park to enjoy the sunshine while learning. Accompanying them was Penny Reid, the school\u2019s Indigenous Support Worker, who told them a local legend before the students were encouraged to come up with their own story showing cause and effect.</p><p>Varney\u2019s students delighted in drawing colourful scenes depicting their stories and presenting them on Centennial Park\u2019s stage. They also visibly enjoyed the chance to run around in nature.</p><p>\u201cSo many of our students are familiar with the park as a place to play and enjoy with their families. Having the opportunity to visit this familiar space and use it to teach about science and the environment will hopefully help students share what they learn with their families,\u201d Varney said. \u201cThe beautiful setting also naturally leads the students to observe and use all their senses to share ideas and ask questions about what they see, hear, or feel. Nature brings a sense of calmness and focus to our lessons.\u201d</p><p>For Reid, the park is the perfect place to share her knowledge of local Secwepemc culture. She noted that most indigenous teachings include a deep respect for the land and nature, along with the interconnectedness of all things. On Thursday she specifically wanted to teach the students about the circle of life, from a seed sprouting into a flower to a snake eating a bird and both returning to the soil to feed plants like the flower.</p><p>\u201cWe also told a legend about a mouse hiding in a fir cone to get away from a forest fire when no other tree would help it,\u201d Reid remarked. \u201c(Outdoors) they take more in and then we can talk about so many other things. It\u2019s just a good jumping-off point.\u201d</p><p>Reid said it just feels good to be outside and she believes there is a lot that we and the students of 100 Mile Elementary can learn from nature. Dawn-Langton agreed, noting this immersive learning experience fosters curiosity, self-confidence and respect for nature among her students.</p><p>\u201cAdditionally, outdoor learning develops self-regulation strategies, allowing them to manage their emotions and behaviours better,\u201d Dawn-Langton said. \u201cImportantly, this approach empowers students to become stewards of the land, instilling a sense of responsibility for its care. By embracing this model, Mrs. Varney\u2019s class cultivates a love for exploration and deepens their understanding of community and culture, making every lesson an enriching adventure that resonates with their everyday lives.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20250410UAEA0004695678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ2-T0H3-RS39-93SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

We pay at a 2:1 ratio, which means, if you complete $2,000 of rework, you get a cheque for $1,000,\u201d he explained.</p><p>The forum concluded with a discussion about the overall risk assessment, balancing the area\u2019s geographic advantages with the increasing impact of climate change.</p><p>The fire chief acknowledged the heightened risk during specific times of the year.</p><p>\u201cNorth Saanich is not a high-risk location, but we must also consider climate change and the occasional heat dome,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cThere are going to be certain days or times of the year when our risk could be extremely high, but those days are few and far between in this area.\u201d</p><p>The forum underscored the importance of community preparedness and proactive measures to protect homes and properties from potential wildfire threats.</p><p>With planned budget proposals for enhanced firefighter training and a new water master plan in the works, North Saanich is taking steps to ensure the community remains fire-smart for years to come.</p><p>North Saanich is not a high-risk location, but we must also consider climate change and the occasional heat dome. \u2014 Steve Sorensen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENREV-news20250417PRQA0004706966</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENREV2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FKJ-KG03-RRSF-6056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438247</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Donald Trump is insisting tonight his punishing global tariffs are working. This as China retaliated with steep tariffs of its own and financial markets plummeted. From opening bell cheers to blood on the trading floor with stock sell-offs around the world after Beijing hit back on Washington with 34% counter tariffs, the sickening reality is sinking in that a global trade war unlike anything seen in generations is on. Since Trump's tariff announcement late Wednesday, the TSX, Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 tumbling as much as 10 %. And as Paul Hunter shows us, the concern isn't confined to the cratering market because if there's no quick way out of this trade war, regular Americans will be caught right in the middle.</p><p><br/><br/>PAUL HUNTER (REPORTER):<br/>From their made-in-China iPhones to their made-in-Vietnam furniture, to Levi's jeans made in Lesotho, to countless other goods and foods sold in the U.S. but made or grown overseas, the big question for Americans is how high will prices now go. As one shopper in Maryland puts it bluntly.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 1:<br/>It is going to be bad for the American people.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 2:<br/>I'm trying to lower my expenses because I think we very much could be going into a recession.<br/><br/>CHUCK SCHUMER (U.S. SENATE MINORITY LEADER):<br/>Fruits and vegetables at the grocery store more expensive, clothing and shoes more expensive. Donald Trump has single-handedly started a financial forest fire.<br/><br/>PAUL HUNTER (REPORTER):<br/>Including as well on Wall Street, rocked by the tariffs, with U.S. stock markets now plunging, leading to the next question: what action will the rest of the world take in response to Donald Trump's move? China's immediate answer, big-time tariffs targeting the U.S. with word now of a giant 34% tariff on all American imports, though some countries taking a different tactic, Vietnam and Cambodia saying they're ready to negotiate with Donald Trump to soften his tariffs.<br/><br/>GAVIN NEWSOM (GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA):<br/>Donald Trump's tariffs do not represent all Americans.<br/><br/>PAUL HUNTER (REPORTER):<br/>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., word California is looking to go it alone.<br/><br/>GAVIN NEWSOM (GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA):<br/>Today, I've directed my administration to look at new opportunities to expand trade and to remind our trading partners around the globe that California remains a stable partner.<br/><br/>PAUL HUNTER (REPORTER):<br/>Into all of this, a sobering view from the U.S. Federal Reserve and its assessment on the impact of Trump's tumultuous move.<br/><br/>JEROME POWELL (CHAIR OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE):<br/>It is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. The size and duration of these effects remains uncertain.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-NA2504042</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGY-8F03-S773-M200-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

(NAM or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option agreement (the Option) dated June 18, 2025 (Effective Date) with Ross Collier, a local prospector (Collier), whereby NAM has been granted the exclusive right to acquire up to 100% interest in mineral license 035215M consisting of 20 claims totalling 500 hectares and known as the Antimony Ridge Property (the Property). The Property is located approximately 120 km south-southwest of the Town of Gander (Newfoundland), six km north of the community of Milltown, and immediately east adjacent to NAMs 100% owned Citadel Property, in the St. Albans region of south-central Newfoundland (Figure 1).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights of the Antimony Ridge Property are:</p><p>1. 10% semi-massive stibnite in historical sampling of quartz vein at the Antimony Ridge Showing and coincident antimony (Sb) soil geochemistry anomaly and an 1100 m long, 50 m wide float train consisting of angular, semi-massive stibnite-quartz boulders1 (Figure 1);</p><p>2.

The historical compilation by NAM together with the recent grassroots work by Mr. Collier and field recon work by Axiom have identified attractive Sb and Au target areas in an emerging mineral belt. Historical exploration focused on gold, not antimony and none of the showings have ever been drilled. We very much look forward to working with Mr. Collier to explore and advance the property and to sharing updates with our shareholders as the program progresses.</p><p>The Option Agreement</p><p>To exercise the Option, NAM agreed to make a series of cash payments and share issuances to Collier and fund exploration expenditures on the Property. From the effective date of June 18, 2025 to year 3 therefrom, the total payments, share issuance and work expenditures are as follows. //st Date Cash Payment NAM Common Shares Work Expenditures Upon signing (Effective Date) $20,000 40,000 N/A Year 1 (from effective date) $10,000 40,000 $30,000 Year 2 (from effective date) $15,000 40,000 $40,000 Year 3 (from effective date) $15,000 40,000 $40,000 TOTALS $60,000 160,000 $110,000</p><p>NAM shall be deemed to have acquired 100% undivided interest in the Property (subject to an NSR royalty) on completion of all the payments and expenditures shown above. Collier shall retain a 2% NSR royalty on all mineral production from the Property. The Company shall have the exclusive right to purchase one percent (1%) of the NSR Royalty for $750,000 at any time prior to commercial production.</p><p>The transaction and any securities issued in connection with the Agreement are subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval and a four-month plus one day hold period in accordance with applicable Securities Laws.</p><p>Antimony Ridge Property</p><p>The Antimony Ridge Project lies in the Dunnage Tectonic Zone and is underlain by Ordovician schistose sedimentary rocks of the St. Joseph's Cove Formation with quartz veins, veinlets and stockworks. Three documented MODS mineral showings occur on the Property; 1) Antimony Ridge Showing; 2) Golden Grit Showing; and 3) Southeast Brook Silver Showing. Most of the work (trenching and sampling) has focused on the Golden Grit Showing. However, none of these 3 showings have ever been drilled. Furthermore, an Sb mineralized boulder trains has been outlined. Exploration planning is underway to locate the bedrock source.</p><p>Antimony and Gold Markets Commentary</p><p>Reuters reported on June 17th, 20253 that China severely restricted antimony exports, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $60,000 per metric tonne, having more than quadrupled over the past year. As a critical metal, antimony's market dynamics are influenced by its applications in various industries and geopolitical factors. China's recent antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal. Approximately 70% of antimony is produced or refined in China.</p><p>Spot gold prices have traded as high as US$3,500 per ounce, likely driven by heightened global uncertainties and increased demand from institutional and retail investors. Central banks have continued their robust gold purchasing in 2025, adding 244 tonnes to their global reserves in Q1 and maintaining a strong pace into Q2, putting them on track for approximately 1,000 tonnes of purchases for the year. This sustained buying action underscores gold's role as a strategic asset amid economic instability and inflation concerns. Retail investors and family offices have also increased their gold holdings, seeking to hedge against market volatility. In Q1 2025, gold ETF inflows surged by 1,114% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 226.5 tonnes. Despite some outflows in May, year-to-date ETF inflows remain strong at over 322 tonnes, reflecting a continued revival in retail appetite for gold.</p><p>The convergence of these factors highlights the strategic importance of antimony and gold antimony on the current global economic landscape.</p><p>3 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-\">https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-</url> antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/</p><p>NAMs Strategic Sb-Au Land Position</p><p>NAMs properties in Newfoundland amount to approximately 19,800 hectares in 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in the St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends (Figures 2 and 3). The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project (Figures 2 and 4).</p><p>Figure 2.

Nevertheless, the Qualified Person considers that drilling and analytical results were completed to industry standard practices. The reader is cautioned that mineral occurrences, prospects and deposits on neighbouring properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Companys properties. This information may provide an indication of the exploration potential of the Properties, but might not be representative of exploration results.</p><p>About NAMs PGE Division</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of green metal projects in North America. The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>About NAMs Lithium Division</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB.

Principal Crystal Dawn-Langton said outdoor education transforms learning into an exciting outdoor adventure. This is especially important among children in Kindergarten and Grade 1, Dawn-Langton noted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Mrs. Tammi Varney's kindergarten class takes full advantage of this emphasis on place-based learning, often venturing into the local park for purposeful lessons. This beautiful park serves as a vibrant extension of the classroom, where children engage with the natural world and discover the stories of the land,\" Dawn-Langton said. \"We hold deep gratitude for this precious space, which enhances their learning experience.\"</p><p>On Thursday, April 3 Varney's class was putting this philosophy into action, heading to Centennial Park to enjoy the sunshine while learning. Accompanying them was Penny Reid, the school's Indigenous Support Worker, who told them a local legend before the students were encouraged to come up with their own story showing cause and effect.</p><p>Varney's students delighted in drawing colourful scenes depicting their stories and presenting them on Centennial Park's stage. They also visibly enjoyed the chance to run around in nature.</p><p>\"So many of our students are familiar with the park as a place to play and enjoy with their families. Having the opportunity to visit this familiar space and use it to teach about science and the environment will hopefully help students share what they learn with their families,\" Varney said. \"The beautiful setting also naturally leads the students to observe and use all their senses to share ideas and ask questions about what they see, hear, or feel. Nature brings a sense of calmness and focus to our lessons.\"</p><p>For Reid, the park is the perfect place to share her knowledge of local Secwepemc culture. She noted that most indigenous teachings include a deep respect for the land and nature, along with the interconnectedness of all things. On Thursday she specifically wanted to teach the students about the circle of life, from a seed sprouting into a flower to a snake eating a bird and both returning to the soil to feed plants like the flower.</p><p>\"We also told a legend about a mouse hiding in a fir cone to get away from a forest fire when no other tree would help it,\" Reid remarked. \"(Outdoors) they take more in and then we can talk about so many other things. It's just a good jumping-off point.\"</p><p>Reid said it just feels good to be outside and she believes there is a lot that we and the students of 100 Mile Elementary can learn from nature. Dawn-Langton agreed, noting this immersive learning experience fosters curiosity, self-confidence and respect for nature among her students.</p><p>\"Additionally, outdoor learning develops self-regulation strategies, allowing them to manage their emotions and behaviours better,\" Dawn-Langton said. \"Importantly, this approach empowers students to become stewards of the land, instilling a sense of responsibility for its care. By embracing this model, Mrs. Varney's class cultivates a love for exploration and deepens their understanding of community and culture, making every lesson an enriching adventure that resonates with their everyday lives.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 100 Mile House Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20250407PAA4711412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHH-J4T3-RS5K-Y1NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

They parked near Foley Creek Forest Service Road, and walked east for about 15 minutes, when they noticed smoke head.</p><p>Initially, they were just disappointed someone would have a campfire at this time.</p><p>\u201cAs we drew closer, we could hear some loud crack-ling and realized there was a fire burning in the forest,\u201d he wrote. Fire crews were called, and the fire was extinguished quickly. But the call had to be made by one of the witnesses newer-model iPhone, which has satellite 911-service capabilities.</p><p>The fire was in the trees, at a point where the trail meets Chilliwack Lake Road. So while they worked to report the fire, someone else pulled over who was able to drive down and call 911 once they got to an area with cell reception.</p><p>Another driver gave Yochim a ride back to his vehicle, and he and his son were able to drive to the small neighbourhood right before Chilliwack Lake where they met up with residents.</p><p>\u201cTwo neighbours there grabbed some fire extinguishers and shovels and followed us back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fire had about doubled in size by the time we returned. They used the fire extinguishers on the larger flames and my son and I used the shovels.\u201d</p><p>He said they had it \u201ccontained\u201d within about 10 minutes, just as they heard the sirens from the fire truck.</p><p>\u201cSoon after we could hear a helicopter arriving,\u201d he said.</p><p>He said they could not figure out exactly how the fire started, as the closest campfire pit had nothing burning it. They did see a box of tissues sitting on a log directly beside the fire.</p><p>Chilliwack Fire Depart-ment reports the call came in around 2:25 p.m., a few hundred metres east of Ford Mountain Correctional Centre. Crews with Chilliwack River Valley Fire Department asked for more firefighters to be called to the scene.</p><p>The fire was called in to BC Wildfire Service. It was later reported that it was not in the Chilliwack River Valley Fire Department\u2019s service area and that Coastal Fire Centre with BC Wildfire Service would be responding with a helicopter and two trucks.</p><p>Chilliwack River Valley Fire Department arrived on scene before Coastal Fire Centre and reported the blaze was about 50 by 150 feet in size and \u201cpretty contained.\u201d</p><p>Shortly after the Chilliwack River Valley Fire Department got there, firefighters on the ground stated that the helicopter had arrived. BC Wildfire Service had the fire listed as under control and under .05 HA by Monday, July 22.</p><p>-with files from Jenna Hauck, Chilliwack Progress The Progress</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20240726PPUA0004510984</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CK2-9851-F0HF-82NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Both areas face serious air pollution during fire season, so they've agreed to focus on creating firebreaks and finding ways to stop people from burning fields.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On February 18, 2025, Mr. Charin Thongsuk, Governor of Chiang Rai Province, and Mr. Khampahya Phompanhya, Deputy Governor of Bokeo Province, jointly presided over the Kick-Off event to promote cooperation on creating firebreaks and reducing burning activities.</p><p>The initiative aims to prevent and address issues related to small particulate matter pollution. The event took place at Kaeng Pha Dai, Moo 4, Ban Huai Luk, Muang Yai Subdistrict, Wiang Kaen District, Chiang Rai Province.</p><p>Joining the event were Mrs. Sineenart Thongsuk, President of the Chiang Rai Red Cross Chapter and head of the provincial women's group, Mr. Prasert Jitpleecheep, Deputy Governor of Chiang Rai, along with government officials, local leaders, and residents from Laos and Chiang Rai.</p><p>Participants worked together to establish firebreaks along the Thailand-Laos border to prevent the spread of fires. Efforts also included raising awareness about reducing burning in agricultural fields and forests along border villages in Wiang Kaen District.</p><p>This event marked a significant step in strengthening trilateral cooperation between Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar to manage and reduce transboundary haze pollution. Discussions were held on advancing collaboration to create firebreaks and reduce burning, with a focus on mitigating forest fire smoke and PM2.5 levels.</p><p>These discussions continued at Wiang Kaen Witthayakhom School in Wiang Kaen District.</p><p>Governor Charin Thongsuk expressed concern over Chiang Rai's vulnerability to severe wildfires and haze, especially during the dry season when agricultural burning is prevalent. Due to its location bordering Laos and Myanmar, Chiang Rai faces increased transboundary pollution, making it difficult to control.</p><p>The governor emphasized that Chiang Rai and Bokeo Province have long shared strong cooperation and awareness of these issues. He highlighted the significance of the Kick-Off event in reinforcing the commitment of both sides to work together seriously on fire prevention and reducing burning. This partnership will pave the way for sustainable solutions and foster continued cross-border collaboration with related agencies.</p><p>Mr. Khampahya Phompanhya, Deputy Governor of Bokeo Province, reaffirmed the strong partnership between Bokeo Province and Chiang Rai in addressing forest fire and haze problems that impact the environment and society. This cooperation has been facilitated through joint mechanisms along the Thailand-Laos border.</p><p>Over the years, the two sides have worked closely to monitor haze conditions and set shared goals for a cleaner future. Both Laos and Thailand remain committed to implementing relevant plans to effectively control fires, relying on mutual trust and seamless cooperation to ensure successful outcomes.</p><p>Mr. Somchit Chanthavong, Deputy Governor of Xayaburi Province, added that Xayaburi, located in western Laos, shares borders with five Thai provinces: Chiang Rai, Phayao, Nan, Uttaradit, Phitsanulok, and Loei.</p><p>It is also connected to three provinces in Laos. He stressed the need for mutual understanding and community awareness to tackle pollution caused by cross-border haze and burning activities. Encouraging people to reduce burning will lead to better health and a sustainable future for both countries.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Supoj Lankawiranan, District Chief of Wiang Kaen, highlighted the district's active role in cross-border collaborations. Along with local residents, the district has followed joint border committee policies between Chiang Rai and Bokeo Province.</p><p>Through security and environmental initiatives, Wiang Kaen has worked on tackling wildfires and haze pollution that affect the environment and people's well-being. Leaders from Huay Xai and Paktha have consistently joined Wiang Kaen's efforts.</p><p>Activities include planting trees to expand green areas, building firebreaks along the border during the dry season, and exchanging knowledge on environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Delegations from Laos have also visited Thailand to learn sustainable methods that can be applied locally.</p><p>Dr. Wijarn Simachaya, Director of the Thailand Environment Institute, noted that the institute, as an environmental NGO, has played a key role in supporting cross-border efforts to manage and reduce transboundary haze pollution.</p><p>Working alongside Chiang Rai and neighbouring countries such as Laos and Myanmar, the collaborative work has advanced both policy-level and on-the-ground solutions.</p><p>Dr. Wijarn highlighted the positive momentum achieved through capacity-building initiatives, knowledge sharing, and study visits, including Laos' delegation to the Mae Chaem Model in Chiang Mai.</p><p>These efforts have provided practical approaches to reducing agricultural burning, offering a clear path towards addressing transboundary haze issues together.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES2002202500002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5H-CHB3-RXVH-D0S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 20, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

But only recently has the event's debt to Indigenous Peoples been recognized. </p><p>\"At the beginning, the city said they were imitating nature. So we reached out to get them to acknowledge that it's actually an Indigenous practice and we have to be involved,\" said Carolynne Crawley, a member of the Indigenous Land Stewardship Circle, which was set up four years ago to do just that.</p><p>Now the burns start with a sunrise ceremony and a sacred fire, the coals of which are used to ignite the drip torches and start the burn. The fire rejuvenates the forest and, rather than destroying it, allows it to thrive.</p><p>\"It honours the land, honours the ancestors,\" said Crawley. </p><p>\"My grandfather burned the lands out in Mi'gma'gi territory, also known as Nova Scotia. The burns would happen every spring,\" said Crawley.</p><p>\"It was an opportunity to clear the lands, to support the plant relatives because some plants and trees require that fire for germination,\" she said. \"The burn also helps to remove that dry brush, that kindling, to prevent forest fires later in the summer.\"</p><p>Setting forest fires has long been discouraged by North American governments, most prominently through the decades-long public relations campaign by the U.S. Forest Service with Smokey Bear. But in an age of forest fires fuelled by climate change that burn down entire neighbourhoods and cities every year, authorities have been rethinking their approach.</p><p>Instead of putting out every forest fire right away, and allowing dead wood to build up on the forest floor, letting - even setting - smaller fires to burn more frequently can remove the fuel and prevent big fires from becoming uncontrollable. </p><p>But it's not just a fire prevention strategy. Prescribed burns also play a role in keeping the ecosystem in balance, something Indigenous Peoples have been doing for centuries.</p><p>The city now calls the annual High Park burn Biinaakzigewok Anishnaabeg, which means \"the responsibility for a cleansing fire by all Native Peoples\" in Anishinaabemowin. </p><p>Elder Donna Powless of Six Nations said she prefers a simpler term: Ode:ka, which means \"it's burning\" in Cayuga.</p><p>A dozen drummers and singers performed a short song at each of the three plots before the eight-person burn crew, who drove down from Owen Sound, laid their drip lines - a mixture of diesel and gasoline - straight onto the forest floor. </p><p>The fire whisks across the dried grasses and dead leaves that litter the ground, consuming seedlings and spring shoots from any early growth, which allows young black oaks to grow without competition.</p><p>The mature black oaks in High Park are hundreds of years old and in decline, said Jason Sickel, who has been serving as burn boss for the past 10 years. Because the park has been manicured and trampled for decades, oak seedlings were unable to get established, he explained.</p><p>Because even tiny oaks have strong root systems that can withstand fire, they're first to shoot up after a burn, he said.</p><p>\"We want to create a multi-age black oak stand,\" said Sickel. \"Through naturalization and fire, and opening up and creating the right proportion of sun and shade, we're now getting a lot of oak regeneration, so there will always be a replacement oak to take the place of one that's fallen.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2025041875164039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FKP-RXW3-RRTY-533F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Principal Crystal Dawn-Langton said outdoor education transforms learning into an exciting outdoor adventure. This is especially important among children in Kindergarten and Grade 1, Dawn Langton noted.</p><p>\"Mrs. Tammi Varney's kindergarten class takes full advantage of this emphasis on place-based learning, often venturing into the local park for purposeful lessons. This beautiful park serves as a vibrant extension of the classroom, where children engage with the natural world and discover the stories of the land,\" Dawn-Langton said. \"We hold deep gratitude for this precious space, which enhances their learning experience.\"</p><p>On Thursday, April 3 Varney's class was putting this philosophy into action, heading to Centennial Park to enjoy the sunshine while learning. Accompanying them was Penny Reid, the school's Indigenous Support Worker, who told them a local legend before the students were encouraged to come up with their own story showing cause and effect.</p><p>Varney's students delighted in drawing colourful scenes depicting their stories and presenting them on Centennial Park's stage. They also visibly enjoyed the chance to run around in nature.</p><p>\"So many of our students are familiar with the park as a place to play and enjoy with their families. Having the opportunity to visit this familiar space and use it to teach about science and the environment will hopefully help students share what they learn with their families,\" Varney said. \"The beautiful setting also naturally leads the students to observe and use all their senses to share ideas and ask questions about what they see, hear, or feel. Nature brings a sense of calmness and focus to our lessons.\"</p><p>For Reid, the park is the perfect place to share her knowledge of local Secwepemc culture. She noted that most indigenous teachings include a deep respect for the land and nature, along with the interconnectedness of all things. On Thursday she specifically wanted to teach the students about the circle of life, from a speed sporting into a flower to a snake eating a bird and both returning to the soil to feed plants like the flower.</p><p>\"We also told a legend about a mouse hiding in a fir cone to get away from a forest fire when no other tree would help it,\" Reid remarked. \"(Outdoors) they take more in and then we can talk about so many other things. It's just a good jumping-off point.\"</p><p>Reid said it just feels good to be outside and she believes there is a lot that we and the students of 100 Mile Elementary can learn from nature. Dawn-Langton agreed, noting this immersive learning experience fosters curiosity, self-confidence and respect for nature among her students.</p><p>\"Additionally, outdoor learning develops self-regulation strategies, allowing them to manage their emotions and behaviours better,\" Dawn-Langton said. \"Importantly, this approach empowers students to become stewards of the land, instilling a sense of responsibility for its care. By embracing this model, Mrs. Varney's class cultivates a love for exploration and deepens their understanding of community and culture, making every lesson an enriching adventure that resonates with their everyday lives.\"</p><p>Copyright 2025 100 Mile House Free Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLEHFP-news20250403PAA4711412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLEHFP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGK-12Y3-RTB8-H4PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Wildfire mapping.</p><p>He emphasized that while not as high risk as areas with extensive wildland-urban interfaces, the intermix interface and climate change still pose a threat.</p><p>Another one of the biggest questions asked by residents during the forum was whether their insurance would protect them in the event of a wildfire.</p><p>Insurance representatives clarified that wildfire is covered under standard insurance policies.</p><p>\"Fire of any type is covered under your insurance policy,\" Lowrey said. \"So, whether it's a stove in your home, or if a gas fireplace was to burn down your home or wildfire, it's always covered.\"</p><p>Stewart also confirmed the availability of rebates up to $1,000 through the CRD for \"fire-smarting\" homes.</p><p>\"That's the CRD limit. We pay at a 2:1 ratio, which means, if you complete $2,000 of rework, you get a cheque for $1,000,\" he explained.</p><p>The forum concluded with a discussion about the overall risk assessment, balancing the area's geographic advantages with the increasing impact of climate change.</p><p>The fire chief acknowledged the heightened risk during specific times of the year.</p><p>\"North Saanich is not a high-risk location, but we must also consider climate change and the occasional heat dome,\" Sorensen said. \"There are going to be certain days or times of the year when our risk could be extremely high, but those days are few and far between in this area.\"</p><p>The forum underscored the importance of community preparedness and proactive measures to protect homes and properties from potential wildfire threats.</p><p>With planned budget proposals for enhanced firefighter training and a new water master plan in the works, North Saanich is taking steps to ensure the community remains fire-smart for years to come.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Peninsula News Review</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENREV-news20250410PPE4713811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENREV2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ5-FRM3-RT1W-R2W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438247</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

It has already had devastating impacts in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada,Eleanor Olszewski, joined by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Tim Hodgson; the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Julie Dabrusin; and the Minister of Indigenous Services, Mandy Gull-Masty, delivered the latest assessment of the 2025 wildfire season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Minister Olszewski reported that, as of today, there are 225 wildfires in Canada and 121 of them are still out of control. The total area burned so far this year is over 3.7 million hectares. And thousands of firefighters are working tirelessly to contain these fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On evacuations, the two Requests for Federal Assistance (RFA) made by the Manitoba government on May 28 to support the Pimicikamak and Mathias Colomb Cree Nations were completed with the help of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). The RFA from Ontario made on June 7 for the evacuation of Sandy Lake is also complete.</p><p>These successful operations were the result of the CAF, provincial counterparts, and non-governmental organizations working around the clock to help the evacuees, find them shelters and fight the fires.</p><p>Wildfires are causing widespread damage to communities, ecosystems, infrastructure and air quality, posing serious risks to public health and safety. As climate change continues to influence weather patterns, preparation and public awareness have never been so important.</p><p>Canadians can access information through theCanadian Wildland Fire Information Systemand learn how to protect themselves by visiting Get Prepared.</p><p>Looking ahead, forecasts point to above-normal temperatures from June through August this year, with potential drought intensifying across many areas in the coming weeks, especially in the northern Prairies and northwestern Ontario.</p><p>Due to these weather forecasts, NRCan modeling predicts elevated fire risk for the first half of June over the northern prairies, southcentral British Columbia and northwestern Ontario. In mid-June, precipitation is anticipated to return to near-normal levels.</p><p>In July, high fire risk is predicted to expand across western Canada, with the most significant risk expected in southern British Columbia. Roughly normal conditions are anticipated for eastern Canada in June and July.</p><p>In August, wildfire activity is expected to continue to increase and persist to well above average conditions over much of western Canada, although it is too early to be certain.</p><p>The federal government stands ready to mobilize additional support wherever needed and in all aspects. We also remain focused on supporting prevention, preparedness, and public awareness efforts.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Our new government remains firm in its commitment to help Canadians prepare for and respond to the growing impact of extreme weather associated to climate change. Through strong cooperation with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities, international partners, and non-governmental organizations, we are taking action to protect Canadians from wildfires. We're here for Canadians, and your safety will always be our priority.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada</p><p>\"Wildfires pose a real threat to the safety, health, and economic well-being of communities across Canada. Our government is working with provinces, territories, Indigenous partners, and others to strengthen Canada's wildfire preparedness and response from advancing science and forecasting, to building the capacity of frontline responders. Together, we are investing in the resilient infrastructure and collaborative systems that Canadians need to stay safe now and into the future.\"</p><p>- The Honourable TimHodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"With extreme weather events becoming more frequent and severe, timely and accurate information is essential to protect the health and safety of Canadians, especially from hazardous smoke during wildfires. Regular, coordinated forecasts help Canadians from coast to coast to coast prepare for current and future climate risks, so our communities can better adapt, respond, and stay safe in the face of climate change.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change</p><p>\"Canada's wildfire season has begun with intense activity affecting First Nations communities in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario communities that continue to face disproportionate risks from these extreme events. First Nations know what their communities need to prepare, respond, and recover and we are working to ensure they have the tools they need. As the threat to health and safety persists, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the firefighters, first responders, and First Nations leadership who are standing with these communities in this challenging time.\"</p><p>  The Honourable Mandy Gull-Masty, Minister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"Wildfires pose a serious risk to physical and mental health, including from smoke exposure and the stress of evacuations.

Production totaled 34,100 ounces in the second quarter, a 12% improvement over the first quarter reflecting higher grades stacked. Production in the second quarter was 36% lower than the prior year period due to the timing of recovery of ounces stacked at La Yaqui Grande, as well as a lower contribution from residual leaching of the Mulatos leach pad. The operation is expected to benefit from the recovery of higher grades stacked during the second quarter through the remainder of the year contributing to higher production in the second half of the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">La Yaqui Grande produced 26,100 ounces in the second quarter, 38% lower than the prior year period. Grades stacked averaged 1.54 g/t Au for the second quarter, near the upper end of annual guidance, and up sharply from the first quarter with the operation benefiting from positive grade reconciliation. Grades stacked are expected to remain at similar levels the remainder of the year.</p><p>Stacking rates averaged 11,200 tpd in the second quarter, exceeding annual guidance but are expected to average 10,500 tpd in the third quarter with the onset of the rainy season. Contained ounces stacked increased to 50,280 ounces, driven by significant increase in grades in the quarter. The recovery rate of 52% in the second quarter was below the annual guidance range reflecting timing of recovery of ounces stacked during the quarter. Given the higher grades stacked later in the quarter, and increased leach pad height, the recovery of a significant portion of ounces stacked in the quarter will be realized in the third and fourth quarters.</p><p>Mulatos commenced residual leaching in December 2023 and produced 8,000 ounces in the second quarter, in-line with expectations. The operation is expected to benefit from ongoing gold production at decreasing rates through the remainder of 2025.</p><p>Mulatos District Financial Review</p><p>Revenues of $110.6 million in the second quarter were 17% lower than the prior year period, reflecting lower ounces sold, partially offset by higher realized gold prices. For the first half of the year, revenues of $194.6 million were 24% lower than the prior year, driven by the same factors.</p><p>Cost of sales decreased to $47.2 million in the second quarter, 37% lower than the prior year period, driven by lower ounces sold. For the first half of the year, cost of sales were $97.8 million or 35% lower than the prior year period, also driven by lower ounces sold.</p><p>Total cash costs of $1,017 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,084 per ounce in the second quarter were lower than the first quarter reflecting higher grades stacked. Both costs were higher than the prior year period, primarily due to a lower contribution of ounces from La Yaqui Grande to Mulatos District production. For the first half of the year, total cash costs of $1,129 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,205 per ounce were both above annual guidance but are expected to decrease through the remainder of the year bringing full year costs in line with guidance.</p><p>Capital expenditures totaled $3.7 million in the second quarter, including $0.5 million of sustaining capital and $1.8 million of capitalized exploration. Growth capital spending of $1.4 million was primarily related to procurement activities and detailed engineering for PDA. Spending on PDA is expected to increase significantly in the second half of the year with the commencement of underground development and placement of long-lead time orders for the mill.</p><p>The Mulatos District generated mine-site free cash flow of $55.2 million in the second quarter and $55.8 million for the first half of the year, lower than the comparative periods reflecting lower gold sales and higher cash taxes. The free cash flow generated was net of $15.4 million of cash tax payments in the second quarter, and $63.7 million in the first half of the year, primarily related to 2024 income and mining taxes payable, and 2025 income tax installments. The Company expects cash tax payments of between $15 and $20 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, related to the 2025 tax year. At current gold prices, the Mulatos District is expected to generate stronger mine-site free cash flow in the second half of the year, reflecting higher production and lower costs.</p><p>Second Quarter 2025 Development Activities</p><p>Island Gold (Ontario, Canada)</p><p>Phase 3+ Expansion</p><p>In 2022, the Company announced the Phase 3+ Expansion at Island Gold to 2,400 tpd from the current rate of 1,200 tpd, which includes various infrastructure investments. These include the installation of a shaft, paste plant, as well as accelerated development to support the higher mining rates. Following the completion of the expansion in 2026, the operation will transition from trucking ore and waste up the ramp to skipping ore and waste to surface through the new shaft infrastructure, driving production higher and costs significantly lower.</p><p>On June 23, 2025, the Company announced the Base Case LOM Plan with the total growth capital estimate for the Phase 3+ Expansion revised to $835 million. This represents a 10% increase from the original growth capital estimate prepared in 2022. The recent increase reflects ongoing labour inflation, as well as the use of a contractor to support off shaft development, and construction activities related to the ore and waste handling system. As at June 30, 2025, 79% of the total initial capital has been spent and committed on the Phase 3+ Expansion.</p><p>In addition, the Company is evaluating the addition of a pebble crusher and auxiliary mill to the Magino mill to support the expansion to 12,400 tpd. This would represent a potential scope change at an additional cost of approximately $40 million. These component changes will be re-evaluated over the next several months to assess if they will be required as part of a potential larger expansion of up to 20,000 tpd. This evaluation process is ongoing and the Expansion Study is expected to be released before the end of 2025.</p><p>During the second quarter of 2025, the Company spent $39.8 million on the Phase 3+ Expansion and capital development. Progress on the Phase 3+ Expansion during the second quarter is summarized as follows: //st * Shaft sinking advanced to a depth of 1,265 m by the end of the second quarter * Completed cladding and roofing for the shaft bin house * Completed bulk earthworks for the Magino mill expansion to 12,400 tpd, with the footprint sized to accommodate a further potential expansion up to 20,000 tpd * Detailed engineering for the larger Magino mill expansion is ongoing and expected to be completed by early 2026 * Paste plant construction over 70% complete * Completed the earthworks for the new administrative complex located adjacent to the shaft infrastructure * Advanced lateral development to support higher mining rates with the Phase 3+ Expansion * Advanced work on the 115kV power line project in partnership with Batchewana First Nation, including holding a groundbreaking ceremony in June</p><p>The Phase 3+ Expansion is on schedule to be completed in the second half of 2026. //st (in US$M) Growth capital (including indirects and contingency) P3+ Estimate June 20251 Spent to date1,2 Committed to date1 % of Spent &amp;Committed Shaft &amp;Shaft Surface Complex 324 234 40 85 % Mill Expansion 67 40 23 94 % Paste Plant 60 30 10 67 % Power Upgrade 38 31 7 100 % General Indirect Costs 91 65 4 76 % Total Growth Capital $580 $400 $84 83 % Underground Equipment, Infrastructure &amp;Accelerated Development 255 177 69 % Total Growth Capital (including Accelerated Spend) $835 $577 $84 79 % 1.

With the approval of the Closure Plan in January 2025, the required permitting and pre-construction conditions have been met allowing for the start of construction on the Lynn Lake project. During the first quarter of 2025, the Company also signed an Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IBA\") with Mathias Colomb Cree Nation (\"MCCN\"). The Company now has IBAs in place with both of the First Nation communities proximate to the Lynn Lake project.</p><p>Given ongoing wildfires that continue to impact communities across northern Manitoba, the ramp up of construction activities on the Lynn Lake project has been temporarily paused. Assuming the resumption of construction activities during the third quarter of 2025, the Company expects the completion of the Lynn Lake project in the second half of 2028. This represents an approximate six-month delay from the previous schedule given the loss of the majority of the summer construction season. With average annual production of 176,000 ounces over its first ten years at first quartile mine-site AISC, Lynn Lake is expected to increase consolidated production to approximately 900,000 ounces per year.</p><p>Growth capital spending at Lynn Lake was initially estimated to be between $100 million and $120 million in 2025, but may vary depending on the timing of the restart of construction activities. Construction activities and capital spending are expected to increase in 2026 and 2027 with first gold production expected in the second half of 2028. Total initial growth capital for Lynn Lake was estimated to be $632 million in the 2023 Feasibility Study (\"2023 Study\"), based on input costs as of the fourth quarter of 2022. As detailed in the three year guidance press release issued in January 2025, initial capital for Lynn Lake is expected to increase by approximately 10% given ongoing industry-wide labour and materials inflation, which has averaged close to 5% per year since the end of 2022. The Company is also evaluating the impact on initial capital caused by the forest fire related delays, and any updates to the initial capital estimate will be provided following the resumption of construction activities.</p><p>On February 13, 2025, the Company reported positive results of an internal economic study completed on its Burnt Timber and Linkwood satellite deposits located in proximity to the Lynn Lake project. The 2023 Study for Lynn Lake was based only on the Gordon and MacLellan deposits which are to be mined over the first 11 years, with the processing of lower grade stockpiled ore for the remainder of the 17-year mine life. The Burnt Timber and Linkwood deposits are expected to provide a source of additional mill feed to the Lynn Lake project starting in year 12, deferring the lower grade stockpiles until later in the mine plan. This is expected to extend the mine life of the combined Lynn Lake project to 27 years, increase longer term production rates, and enhance its economics as a low-capital, high-return satellite project.</p><p>The two deposits are expected to produce an average of 83,000 ounces of gold per year over a 10 year mine life. By leveraging mining equipment and planned processing infrastructure at Lynn Lake, the project is expected to be developed for low initial capital of $67 million. This is expected to contribute to high returns for the Burnt Timber and Linkwood satellite deposits, with an after-tax internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of 54%, and after-tax NPV (5%) of $177 million at a base case gold price assumption of $2,200 per ounce and CAD/USD foreign exchange rate of $0.75:1. At a gold price of $2,800 per ounce and CAD/USD foreign exchange rate of $0.70:1, returns increase to an after-tax IRR of 83% and after-tax NPV (5%) of $292 million.</p><p>Development spending (excluding exploration) was $18.8 million in the second quarter of 2025, primarily on temporary camp installation, site facilities, tree clearing and process design engineering.</p><p>PDA (Sonora, Mexico)</p><p>On September 4, 2024, the Company reported the results of the development plan for the PDA project located within the Mulatos District. PDA is a higher-grade underground deposit adjacent to the Mulatos open pit and will benefit from the use of existing crushing infrastructure from Cerro Pelon, supporting lower initial capital and project execution risk.</p><p>On January 29, 2025, the Company announced it has been granted approval of an amendment to its existing environmental impact assessment (Manifestacin de Impacto Ambiental) by Mexicos Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, allowing for the start of construction on the PDA project. Construction activities on PDA are expected to begin ramping up in the third quarter of 2025. Capital spending on PDA is expected to total $37 to $40 million in 2025 to advance underground development and procurement of mill long lead time items. The remainder of the total initial capital estimate of $165 million will be spent in 2026 and 2027 with first production anticipated mid-2027.</p><p>As outlined in the 2024 development plan, PDA is expected to produce an average of 127,000 ounces per year over the first four years and 104,000 ounces over the current mine life (based on Mineral Reserves as at December 31, 2023). Total cash costs are expected to average $921 per ounce and mine-site AISC $1,003 per ounce, consistent with the Companys overall low cost structure.</p><p>Reflecting the low cost structure and low initial capital, PDA is expected to be a high-return project with significant exploration upside. PDA has an estimated after-tax IRR of 46% and after-tax NPV (5%) of $269 million using base case gold price assumption of $1,950 per ounce and a MXN/USD foreign exchange rate of 18:1. Using a $2,500 per ounce gold price, PDA's after-tax IRR increases to 73%, and after-tax NPV (5%) increases to $492 million.</p><p>Development spending (excluding exploration) was $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2025, primarily focused on procurement activities and detailed engineering. Spending on PDA is expected to increase in second half of the year with underground development commencing.</p><p>Kirazl (anakkale, Trkiye)</p><p>On October 14, 2019, the Company suspended all construction activities on its Kirazl project following the Turkish government's failure to grant a routine renewal of the Companys mining licenses, despite the Company having met all legal and regulatory requirements for their renewal. In October 2020, the Turkish government refused the renewal of the Companys Forestry Permit. The Company had been granted approval of all permits required to construct Kirazl including the Environmental Impact Assessment approval, Forestry Permit, and GSM (Business Opening and Operation) permit, and certain key permits for the nearby A Da and amyurt Gold Mines. These permits were granted by the Turkish government after the project earned the support of the local communities and passed an extensive multi-year environmental review and community consultation process.</p><p>On April 20, 2021, the Company announced that its Netherlands wholly-owned subsidiaries Alamos Gold Holdings Coperatief U.A, and Alamos Gold Holdings B.V. (Subsidiaries) would be filing an investment treaty claim against the Republic of Trkiye for expropriation and unfair and inequitable treatment. The claim was filed under the Netherlands-Trkiye Bilateral Investment Treaty (Treaty). Alamos Gold Holdings Coperatief U.A. and Alamos Gold Holdings B.V. had their claim against the Republic of Trkiye registered on June 7, 2021 with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (World Bank Group).</p><p>Bilateral investment treaties are agreements between countries to assist with the protection of investments. The Treaty establishes legal protections for investment between Trkiye and the Netherlands. The Subsidiaries directly own and control the Companys Turkish assets. The Subsidiaries invoking their rights pursuant to the Treaty does not mean that they relinquish their rights to the Turkish project, or otherwise cease the Turkish operations. The Company will continue to work towards a constructive resolution with the Republic of Trkiye.</p><p>The Company incurred $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2025 related to ongoing care and maintenance and arbitration costs to progress the Treaty claim, which were expensed.</p><p>Second Quarter 2025 Exploration Activities</p><p>Island Gold District (Ontario, Canada)</p><p>A total of $27 million is budgeted for exploration at the Island Gold District in 2025, up from $20 million spent in 2024. The exploration program will build on the success from 2024, with high-grade gold mineralization extended across the Island Gold deposit, as well as within multiple structures of the hanging wall and footwall.</p><p>As announced on June 23, 2025, Mineral Reserves at Island Gold underground increased 138% to 4.1 million ounces with grades increasing 5% to 10.85 g/t Au (11.8 mt) driven by Mineral Resource conversion. This marked the 12th consecutive year of Mineral Reserve growth. An updated classification methodology was adopted based on definition drilling, extensive historical and current production data, reconciliation, and underground mapping, which demonstrates that Indicated Mineral Resource continuity can be reliably established with an average drill spacing of 40 metres, versus 25 metres previously. This contributed to the conversion of a portion of the large Inferred Mineral Resource to Measured &amp;Indicated Mineral Resources, which was subsequently converted to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>Reflecting the conversion to Mineral Reserves, Inferred Mineral Resources decreased 64% to 1.3 million ounces with grades increasing 16% to 16.88 g/t Au (2.4 mt). Consistent with the increase in Mineral Reserve grades, a key driver of the increase in Mineral Resource grades has been significantly higher-grade additions in the lower portions of Island East and Island Main. With the deposit open laterally and at depth, and some of the best intercepts ever drilled at Island Gold located within the lower portion of Island East, there is excellent potential for further growth in Mineral Reserves and Resources. The discovery cost of the high-grade Mineral Resource additions averaged an attractive $13 per ounce in 2024, and $13 per ounce over the past five years.</p><p>A total of 41,500 m of underground drilling is planned in 2025 with a focus on defining new Mineral Reserves and Resources in proximity to existing production horizons and infrastructure. This includes drilling across the strike extent of the main Island Gold deposit (E1E and C-Zones), as well as within a growing number of newly defined hanging-wall and footwall zones.</p><p>Additionally, 18,000 m of surface exploration drilling has been budgeted targeting the area between the Island Gold and Magino deposits, as well as the down-plunge extension of the Island Gold deposit, below a depth of 1,500 m. Included within sustaining capital, 30,800 m of underground delineation drilling is planned and focused on the ongoing conversion of the large Mineral Resource base to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>Maginos exploration program has been incorporated into the broader Island Gold District budget which totals $27 million. The focus in 2025 will be expanding mineralization to the east of the pit, which was previously constrained by the border with Island Gold prior to the acquisition. Included within 2025 sustaining capital guidance is 18,000 m of surface delineation drilling planned at Magino. The focus of the delineation drilling is the conversion of the large Mineral Resource base to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>The regional exploration program at the Island Gold District includes 10,000 m of surface drilling, consistent with the 2024 program. The focus will be following up on high-grade mineralization intersected at the Cline-Pick and Edwards deposits located approximately seven km northeast of the Island Gold mine. Drilling will also be completed at the Island Gold North Shear target, and to the east and along strike from the Island Gold mine to test the extension of the E1E-zone.</p><p>During the second quarter, 12,635 m of underground exploration drilling was completed in 53 holes, and 1,893 m of surface drilling was completed in one hole at Island Gold. Additionally, 11,173 m of underground delineation drilling was completed in 40 holes, focused on in-fill drilling to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves. A surface delineation program also commenced during the quarter, targeting Mineral Resource-to-Reserve conversion in the lower portion of Island East. To support this effort, 4,713 m were drilled in two holes. Furthermore, a total of 93 meters of underground exploration drift development was completed during the second quarter.</p><p>At Magino, 12,008 m of surface drilling was completed in 23 holes during the second quarter, focused on in-fill drilling to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>The regional exploration drilling program continued during the second quarter, with 4,273 m completed in 15 holes targeting mineralization at the past-producing Cline-Pick and Edwards mines.</p><p>As detailed in the June 2025 exploration update, the program continues to have broad based success with drilling extending high-grade gold mineralization across the Island Gold Deposit, as well as within several hanging wall and footwall structures, highlighting the significant near-mine upside potential. Additionally, the regional exploration program has been successful in intersecting high-grade gold mineralization at the past-producing Cline-Pick and Edwards mines highlighting longer-term opportunities for further growth.</p><p>Total exploration expenditures during the second quarter of 2025 were $6.8 million, of which $5.1 million was capitalized. In the first half of the year, the Company incurred exploration expenditures of $11.8 million, of which $9.0 million was capitalized.</p><p>Young-Davidson (Ontario, Canada)</p><p>A total of $11 million is budgeted for exploration at Young-Davidson in 2025, an increase from $9 million spent in 2024. This includes 25,600 m of underground exploration drilling focused on extending mineralization in the syenite, and continuing to evaluate and expand on the newly defined hanging wall zones.</p><p>To support the program, 500 m of underground exploration development is planned, including 400 m to establish a hanging wall exploration drift to the south, from the 9620 level. As of June 30, 2025, 300 m had been completed in the hanging wall drift and is expected to be completed in the third quarter. This will allow for drill platforms with more optimal locations and orientations to test the higher grade mineralization discovered in the hanging wall.</p><p>The regional program includes 6,000 m of drilling focused on evaluating the Otisse NE target, located approximately three km northeast of Young-Davidson. A comprehensive data compilation project will also commence in 2025 for the Wydee and Matachewan projects, which were acquired in the third quarter of 2024, and located to the west and east of Young-Davidson, respectively.</p><p>During the second quarter, two underground exploration drills completed 5,009 m in nine holes from the 9440 and 9500 levels. Drilling is targeting syenite-hosted mineralization as well as continuing to test mineralization in the hanging wall sediments and mafic-ultramafic stratigraphy.</p><p>Total exploration expenditures during the second quarter of 2025 were $3.8 million, of which $2.9 million was capitalized. In the first half of 2025, the Company incurred exploration expenditures of $6.8 million, of which $4.9 million was capitalized.</p><p>Mulatos District (Sonora, Mexico)</p><p>A total of $19 million is budgeted at Mulatos for exploration in 2025, down slightly from $21 million spent in 2024. The near-mine and regional drilling program is expected to total 45,000 m. This includes 15,000 m of surface exploration drilling at the GAP-Victor and PDA Extension targets at PDA, and 20,000 m planned at Cerro Pelon. The regional exploration program includes 10,000 m of drilling focused on advanced and greenfield targets within the Mulatos District.</p><p>Ongoing exploration success at PDA in 2024 drove a 9% increase in Mineral Reserves to 1.1 million ounces, with grades largely unchanged at 5.45 g/t Au. PDA is a higher-grade underground deposit located adjacent to the main Mulatos pit. The results of a positive internal economic study were announced in September 2024 and highlighted an attractive, low-cost, high-return project. With the amendment to the environmental permit received earlier this year, construction activities are expected to begin ramping up towards the middle of the year with first production anticipated mid-2027.</p><p>The planned addition of a mill to process higher-grade sulphides has created new opportunities for growth within the Mulatos District. This includes Cerro Pelon, where drilling in 2024 followed up on wide high-grade underground oxide and sulphide intersections previously drilled below the pit. The 2024 program was successful in defining an initial Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource at Cerro Pelon totaling 104,000 ounces, grading 4.49 g/t Au. Cerro Pelon remains open in multiple directions and will be a focus of the 2025 exploration program as a significant opportunity for further growth. As the deposit is located within trucking distance of the planned PDA mill, this represents upside to the PDA project.</p><p>During the second quarter, exploration activities continued at PDA and the near-mine area with 7,791 m of drilling completed in 27 holes. The focus was on infill drilling the GAP-Victor portion as well as the eastern extent of the PDA zone.</p><p>Drilling continued at Cerro Pelon with the focus on evaluating the high-grade sulphide potential to the north of the historical open pit. A total of 6,744 m in 24 holes were completed in the second quarter. Additionally, 6,273 m was drilled in 23 holes, testing greenfield targets across the property.</p><p>Total exploration expenditures during the second quarter of 2025 were $6.0 million, of which $1.8 million was capitalized. In the first half of the year, exploration expenditures totaled $9.0 million, of which $2.5 million was capitalized.</p><p>Lynn Lake (Manitoba, Canada)</p><p>A total of $4 million is budgeted for exploration at the Lynn Lake project in 2025, down from $7 million spent in 2024, with the focus shifting to the ramp up of construction activities. The exploration program includes 7,000 m of drilling focused on expanding Mineral Resources at the Burnt Timber and Linkwood deposits. The Company will also continue prioritizing a pipeline of prospective exploration targets within the 58,000-ha Lynn Lake Property.</p><p>As reported on February 18, 2025, total Mineral Reserves for the Lynn Lake District increased 42% to 3.3 million ounces, with grades decreasing 15% to 1.29 g/t Au. This was driven by the successful conversion of Mineral Resources to Reserves at Burnt Timber and Linkwood in 2024 resulting in an initial Mineral Reserve of 0.9 million ounces grading 0.95 g/t Au.</p><p>Burnt Timber and Linkwood are satellite deposits to the Lynn Lake project and are expected to provide additional mill feed. An internal economic study on Burnt Timber and Linkwood was released on February 13, 2025, outlining an attractive, low capital, high-return project. Burnt Timber and Linkwood are expected to extend the mine life of the Lynn Lake project, increase longer term rates of production, and enhance the overall economics. The combined mine life of the Lynn Lake project is expected to increase to 27 years, up from the 17 years outlined in the 2023 Study.</p><p>The 2025 surface exploration program was completed in the first quarter. The focus was on Mineral Resource expansion drilling at both Burnt Timber and Linkwood, with 7,268 m completed in 41 holes.</p><p>Exploration spending totaled $0.7 million in the second quarter and $2.6 million for the first half of the year, all of which was capitalized.</p><p>Qiqavik (Quebec, Canada)</p><p>A total of $7 million has been budgeted for exploration at the Qiqavik project in 2025, up from $4 million spent in 2024. The project was acquired in April 2024 through the acquisition of Orford Mining Corporation.</p><p>Qiqavik is a camp-scale property covering 60,400 ha in the Cape Smith Greenstone Belt in Nunavik, Quebec. The Qiqavik project covers 50 km of strike covering prospective gold hosting environments and several major crustal-scale structures such as the Qiqavik break and the Bergeron fault. Early-stage exploration completed to date indicates that high-grade gold occurrences are controlled by structural splays off the Qiqavik break.</p><p>The 2025 exploration program will focus on drilling prospective targets identified in 2024 through detailed geological mapping, prospecting, till sampling, and a high-resolution Lidar survey with photo imagery. A total of 7,000 m of helicopter supported surface drilling is planned with two rigs and focused on testing the highest priority target areas. The program will also focus on advancing other targets across the belt with ongoing geological mapping, drone magnetics, prospecting, and additional till sampling.</p><p>Exploration activities in the second quarter were focused on continued data interpretation to support targeting ahead of the summer drill program. At the end of the second quarter, the camp had been set up and drills were mobilized to site for the start of the summer drill program.</p><p>Exploration spending totaled $1.4 million in the second quarter and $1.7 million for first half of the year all of which was expensed.</p><p>Review of Second Quarter Financial Results</p><p>During the second quarter of 2025, the Company sold 135,027 ounces of gold for record operating revenues of $438.2 million, representing a 32% increase from the prior year period. The increase was due to higher realized gold prices and the inclusion of ounces at Magino given its acquisition in July 2024, partially offset by lower sales volumes at La Yaqui Grande due to timing of ounces recovered on the leach pad, and at Young-Davidson where higher-than-normal water levels impacted the mining rates.</p><p>The average realized gold price in the second quarter was $3,223 per ounce, 38% higher than the prior year period. This was $57 per ounce less the London PM Fix price for the quarter, reflecting the delivery of the 12,346 ounces into the gold prepayment facility entered into in July 2024 based on the prepaid price of $2,524 per ounce.</p><p>Cost of sales (which includes mining and processing costs, royalties, and amortization expense) were $200.7 million in the second quarter, 16% higher than the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of higher cost ounces from Magino. Excluding costs incurred at Magino, cost of sales were $149.9 million which was 13% lower than the prior year period, driven by the lower sales volumes at the Mulatos District and Young-Davidson. Key drivers of changes to cost of sales as compared to the prior year period were as follows:</p><p>Mining and processing costs were $140.4 million, 20% higher than the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of Magino. Excluding costs incurred at Magino, mining and processing costs were $105.1 million, 10% lower than the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ounces sold at Mulatos and Young-Davidson.</p><p>Total cash costs of $1,075 per ounce and AISC of $1,475 per ounce were above the prior year period driven by the higher costs per ounce at Young-Davidson, due to lower grades and mining rates, the inclusion of higher cost ounces at Magino, and higher share-based compensation and royalty expense.</p><p>Royalty expense was $7.6 million in the second quarter, higher than the prior year period of $3.0 million, due to the higher average realized gold price, and inclusion of royalties incurred at Magino.</p><p>Amortization of $52.7 million in the second quarter was consistent with the prior year period. On a per ounce basis, amortization of $390 per ounce was higher than the prior year period, reflecting the inclusion of Magino which has a higher amortization base.</p><p>The Company recognized earnings from operations of $216.2 million in the second quarter, 56% higher than the prior year period, driven by the higher gold price.</p><p>As at June 30, 2025, the Company held forward contracts that were acquired as part of the acquisition of Argonaut. These legacy contracts, totaling 100,000 ounces in 2026 and 50,000 ounces in 2027, have an average forward price of $1,821 per ounce, and mature monthly throughout 2026 and 2027. The Company recognized unrealized losses of $25.8 million on the forward contracts inherited from Argonaut driven by the movement in gold price in the second quarter. The Company recognized unrealized losses of $0.4 million on gold option contracts in the prior year period.</p><p>The Company reported net earnings of $159.4 million in the second quarter, compared to $70.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings(1) were $144.1 million, or $0.34 per share, which included an adjustment for unrealized losses on the legacy Argonaut commodity hedge derivatives, net of tax of $17.1 million. In addition, adjusted earnings reflect net unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded within deferred taxes and foreign exchange losses totaling $34.3 million and other adjustments of $1.9 million.</p><p>(1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Measures and Additional GAAP Measures section of this press release and associated MD&amp;A for a description and calculation of these measures.</p><p>Associated Documents</p><p>This press release should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended June 30, 2025 and associated Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A), which are available from the Company's website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.alamosgold.com\">www.alamosgold.com</url>, in the \"Investors\" section under \"Reports and Financials\", and on SEDAR+ (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url>) and EDGAR (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>).</p><p>Reminder of Second Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call</p><p>The Company's senior management will host a conference call on Thursday, July 31, 2025 at 10:00 am ET to discuss the second quarter 2025 results.

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators, which established standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Mining disclosure in the United States was previously required to comply with SEC Industry Guide 7 (SEC Industry Guide 7) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The SEC has adopted final rules, to replace SEC Industry Guide 7 with new mining disclosure rules under sub-part 1300 of Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities Act (Regulation S-K 1300) which became mandatory for U.S. reporting companies beginning with the first fiscal year commencing on or after January 1, 2021. Under Regulation S-K 1300, the SEC now recognizes estimates of Measured Mineral Resources, Indicated Mineral Resources and Inferred Mineral Resources. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of Proven Mineral Reserves and Probable Mineral Reserves to be substantially similar to international standards.</p><p>Investors are cautioned that while the above terms are substantially similar to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under Regulation S-K 1300 and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as proven mineral reserves, probable mineral reserves, measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under Regulation S-K 1300. U.S. investors are also cautioned that while the SEC recognizes measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under Regulation S-K 1300, investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater degree of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable.</p><p>International Financial Reporting Standards: The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by management in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB (note 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024).

Villagers, camp operators, mahouts, and elephants are working together to create firebreaks and patrol for forest fires.</p><p>On March 17, 2025, at Ban Pang Mai Daeng Forest in Ban Chang Subdistrict, Mae Taeng District, officials, business leaders, and local stakeholders joined forces with local elephant camps for this campaign.</p><p>Participants included Mr. Siwakorn Buapong, Chiang Mai's Deputy Governor, and Mr. Supamit Kitjapitpat, President of the Chiang Mai Tourism Business Association, alongside local administrative bodies, elephant rescue parks, and various elephant camps in Mae Taeng.</p><p>The forest fire and PM 2.5 pollution issue have severely impacted air quality, ecosystems, forestry resources, and public health across Chiang Mai. Wildlife, including the region's elephants, also faces these challenges. Mae Taeng District is home to more than 400 domesticated elephants, making this area particularly vulnerable. With elephants being a cultural symbol of Thailand, the community has come together to establish effective fire prevention measures.</p><p>Creating firebreaks not only helps stop fires from spreading but also protects natural resources and reduces air pollution affecting both people and wildlife.</p><p>The Deputy Governor emphasized that forest fires are a major problem in Chiang Mai. Authorities are working around the clock to monitor and resolve these issues. Collaboration between government agencies and local communities is essential for creating firebreaks to prevent future fires. Efforts like this improve air quality and protect the health of both residents and elephants.</p><p>Mr. Supamit Kitjapitpat, representing the Chiang Mai Tourism Business Association, highlighted two current initiatives: the 'Elephant Community Against Forest Fires' project and the 'Clean Air Campaign.</p><p>' These efforts aim to improve air quality for Chiang Mai residents. Private sector involvement plays a key role in both prevention and mitigation, but addressing this challenge requires cooperation from all sectors as it is a nationwide concern.</p><p>Mr. Apichit Duangdee, owner of the Elephant Rescue Park, added that many camps in Mae Taeng are located near forested areas, making them directly affected by fires. During the dry season, dry leaves and vegetation act as fuel, increasing the risk of fire. This poses a threat to elephants, as some are afraid of fire and could panic, leading to further issues. The campaign not only benefits the environment but also the local community and elephants.</p><p>As part of today's efforts, two elephants, Plai Namchok and Pang Mae Noi, helped remove large dry branches that could spark fires. Their strength made these tasks easier and more effective. Additionally, Phra Khru Aod from Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai supported the volunteers by providing food and drinks to those working on fire prevention efforts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES1803202500002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC3-3BT3-RXR6-M1ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 18, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924110GJ</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

The bodies of a man and a woman were recovered by police on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Kinew urged people\u00a0heading into\u00a0the May long weekend - traditionally the unofficial start to summer and camping season -\u00a0to listen to evacuation orders and stay out of areas where emergency crews are working.</p><p>\"This is a really serious situation we're in\u00a0in Manitoba right now,\" he said.</p><p>As of Thursday, there are 21 fires burning in the province,\u00a0with a total of 80 recorded so far this season, fire officials said at the news conference. The 20-year average for fires by this time of year\u00a0is 48.</p><p>Whiteshell Provincial Park,\u00a0a popular cottage and camping destination south and east of Lac du Bonnet,\u00a0is\u00a0closed to the public as of 9 a.m. Thursday until at least May 21.\u00a0Everyone has to be out of the\u00a02,700-square-kilometre park\u00a0by 1 p.m.</p><p>In addition to the Lac du Bonnet fire, there are out-of-control fires north and east of the Whiteshell.</p><p>Kinew said a state of emergency will be declared for the Whiteshell area later Thursday morning.</p><p>\"This situation is very dynamic. We are asking Manitobans to monitor messaging from local authorities and to heed their advice and direction,\" said\u00a0Christine Stevens, assistant deputy minister for the Manitoba Emergency Management Organization.</p><p>The Whiteshell\u00a0reaches to the Ontario border, where an out-of-control fire at Ingolf, Ont., estimated at 23,000 hectares, edged into Manitoba from the Kenora district on Wednesday night. Officials\u00a0didn't yet have information about how much it has encroached into Manitoba.</p><p/><p>Manitoba is assessing properties in Whiteshell Provincial Park to determine which need the most protection at this time. The state of emergency will allow crews to work unimpeded.</p><p>\"So this May long weekend is going to be challenging in Manitoba. Not only are we dealing with wildfires in the east, where we could use a lot of rain to help us out, we're also dealing with <url normalizedValue=\"http://Said a state of emergency will be declared there later Thursday morning\">an overland flood warning in western Manitoba</url> as a result of too much precipitation potentially coming in that part of the province,\"\u00a0Kinew said.</p><p>Loren Schinkel, reeve of the rural municipality of Lac du Bonnet, saw videos taken by public works and hydro employees of the Grausdin Point area, \"and frankly, it's devastating, it's heart-wrenching,\" he said Thursday.</p><p>\"We've lost 28 dwellings in that area, and it goes without saying the loss of life - you can't really describe it in words. I just want them to know that we're all suffering with them. At the end of the day, we are one big family here.\"</p><p>The area received a bit of rain overnight into Thursday but not nearly enough, Schinkel said. But, he said, \"if the wind stays down, we're in good fortune.\"</p><p>An estimated 800 to 1,000 people have been forced from their homes in the rural municipality, but Schinkel is optimistic some good news is coming.</p><p>\"We're hoping\u00a0there's going to be some modifications today in the evacuation orders. I haven't spoken with emergency measures yet, but I think there'll be some movement today.\"</p><p>While crews have been able to make good progress on that\u00a0fire, listed at about 4,000 hectares as of\u00a0Thursday,\u00a0it is still labelled as out of control, said\u00a0Kristin Hayward, assistant deputy minister for the Conservation Officer Service and Manitoba Wildfire Service.</p><p>A lot of crews and other resources were focused on the Lac du Bonnet fire, but it is still an active fire zone and people must stay away, Hayward said.</p><p>It hasn't been as intense as the largest wildfire in the province,\u00a0in the Bird River and Nopiming Provincial Park area just north of Whiteshell.</p><p>The Bird River/Nopiming\u00a0fire is more than 100,000 hectares and belching thick smoke\u00a0that's hampering efforts to get water bombers in the air.</p><p>Crews there have instead shifted to protecting properties where it's less dangerous.</p><p>Meanwhile, about 40 firefighters from British Columbia have been working since Monday on a\u00a042,000-hectare\u00a0fire near The Pas and\u00a0Opaskwayak Cree Nation in northwestern Manitoba.</p><p>They are now finishing up, checking hot spots, and the province is looking into whether they can be redeployed to the eastern part of the province, Hayward said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A live map shows perimeters for the RM of Lac Du Bonnet fire and others in the area:</emphasis></p><p>Manitoba also made a request Wednesday through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre for an additional\u00a080 firefighters to come to Manitoba.</p><p>\"We are hopeful that we will be receiving those from across Canada,\" Hayward said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a\u00a0fire in the rural municipality of Piney, near the Manitoba-U.S. border, remains out of control at around 7,000 hectares.</p><p>\"Fortunately, it sounds like that area did receive some rain last evening,\" Hayward said.</p><p>\"We're still waiting on reports of how much rain fell over the specific fire, but we'll take anything we can get at this point.\"</p><p>The Manitoba government has faced some criticism about how people were notified of evacuations in\u00a0communities under threat</p><p>Kinew was asked Thursday why the province didn't use the emergency alert system to send messages to cellphones.</p><p>\"When we talk about the response, we're talking about following a plan that has been set up and drilled and practised, and because of that prep work, we don't necessarily want to change the MO [modus operandi] unless there's a serious, I guess, call for that to happen,\" he said.</p><p>\"So I can tell you that the idea of putting out an emergency alert was part of the discussions that we've had, but in the first instance, we go with the plan that's been drilled.\"</p><p>Kinew\u00a0intends to visit some of the impacted communities, but he's not sure when.</p><p>\"That might occur today but again, I don't want to get in the way at the same time,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadamanitobawildfireupdatemanitobapremier17535513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FTG-R0M3-S0NM-M1MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><timeReceived>1:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

They're the same roads used by thousands of families and commercial truckers who cross into Mexico and back each day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cDiseases know no borders,\" said Ocaranza, El Paso's top public health doctor, \"so as people are mobile, they're going to be coming and receiving medical attention in El Paso but they may be living in Juarez.\u201d It took a couple of months, but El Paso now has the highest measles case count in the state outside of West Texas with 38. Neighboring Ciudad Juarez has 14 cases as of Monday.</p><p>North America's three biggest measles outbreaks continue to balloon, with more than 2,500 known cases; three people have died in the U.S. and one in Mexico. It started in the fall in Ontario, Canada; then took off in late January in Texas and New Mexico; and has rapidly spread in Chihuahua state, which is up to 786 cases since mid-February.</p><p>These outbreaks are in areas with a notable population of certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas. Chihuahua health officials trace their first case to an 8-year-old Mennonite child who visited family in Seminole, got sick and spread the virus at school. And Ontario officials say their outbreak started at a large gathering in New Brunswick involving Mennonite communities.</p><p>Mexican and U.S. officials also say the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match the other large outbreaks.</p><p>\u201cThis virus was imported, traveling country to country,\u201d said Leticia Ru\u00edz, director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua.</p><p>North and South American countries have struggled to maintain the 95% measles vaccination rate needed to prevent outbreaks, said Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization. And a recent World Health Organization report said measles activity in the Americas region is up elevenfold from the same time last year and that the risk level is \u201chigh\u201d compared to the rest of the world's \u201cmoderate\u201d level.</p><p>Measles cases have been confirmed in six of the region\u2019s countries \u2014 Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, the United States and Mexico \u2014 and investigating the disease's spread is labor-intensive and pricey. The response to each measles case in the U.S. costs an estimated $30,000 to $50,000, according to Dr. David Sugerman, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist.</p><p>Measles at the U.S.-Mexico border</p><p>The cases in Ciudad Juarez have no direct connection to the Mennonite settlement in Chihuahua, said Rogelio Covarrubias, a health official in the border city. The first measles case in El Paso was in a child at Fort Bliss, Ocaranza said.</p><p>More than half of El Paso's cases are in adults, which is unusually high, and three people have been hospitalized. The health department is holding vaccination clinics in malls and parks and says hundreds have gotten a shot. The vaccines are free \u2014 no questions asked, no matter which side of the border you live on.</p><p>Communication about measles between the two health departments is \u201cinformal\u201d but \u201cvery good,\u201d Ocaranza said. Covarrubias said his team was alerted last week to a case of someone who became sick in El Paso and returned home to Juarez.</p><p>\u201cThere is constant concern in Ciudad Juarez \u2026 because we have travelers that pass through from across the world,\u201d Covarrubias said. \u201cWith a possible case of measles without taking precautions, many, many people could be infected.\u201d</p><p>Measles at the U.S.-Canada border</p><p>Michigan health officials said the outbreak of four cases in Montcalm County are linked to Ontario.</p><p>The state's chief medical executive, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, expects to see more cases. Michigan has a 95% vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella, but it hides weak spots \u2014 counties with 70% vaccination rates and individual schools where just 30% of kids vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cIf we think about measles as a forest fire, we've got these burning embers that are floating in the air right now,\" Bagdasarian said. \"Whether those embers result in another wildfire just depends on where they land.\u201d</p><p>In Canada, six out of 10 provinces have reported measles cases. Alberta has the second-most with 83 as of April 12, according to government data.         </p><p>Case counts in Ontario reached 1,020 as of Wednesday, mostly in the southwest part that borders Michigan. In one of the hardest-hit regions, Chatham-Kent Public Health officials announced a public exposure at a Mennonite church on Easter Sunday.</p><p>\u201cIt sometimes feels like we're just behind, always trying to catch up to measles,\u201d Dr. Sarah Wilson, a public health physician for Public HealthOntario. \u201cIt's always moving somewhere.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Janetsky reported from Mexico City.

Anyone who wasn't immune would likely get measles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's like a forest fire,\" said Barton, division head of Paediatric Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre. \"It will continue to burn until all the trees are gone.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At first, many of those sick enough to need hospital care were infants and young children.</p><p>As the outbreak spread, cases swelling from dozens to hundreds to now more than 1,600 provincewide, a new group of measles patients has emerged - one that few doctors in Canada have treated before.</p><p>Pregnant people were getting sick with measles. And Barton, working at the outbreak's epicentre, raced to figure out how to care for them and their babies.</p><p>\"Because we're now talking about not just one patient, but two or even three,\" she said. \"Measles is hitting the adult mother, and it's hitting her baby in her womb.\"</p><p>Ontario's measles outbreak, the largest in Canada in almost 30 years, started last October and has since sickened hundreds of people, the majority unvaccinated infants, children and teens. As of May 13, the outbreak has led to at least 1,622 cases, including 119 who have been hospitalized, according to Public HealthOntario. Of those hospitalized, 89 were unimmunized children.</p><p>Though kids have borne the brunt, adults are also getting sick. At least 377 people 20 and older, about two-thirds of whom were not vaccinated, have now been infected with what is typically thought of as a childhood disease. </p><p>Before routine immunization programs slashed measles cases in Canada, few people would get to child-bearing age without natural immunity. Now, in the post-vaccine era, people who did not get vaccinated as children have grown up to become \"vulnerable hosts,\" said Barton.</p><p>\"In a full-blown outbreak, with measles circulating in their community, (unvaccinated) pregnant women are at risk.\"</p><p>Studies from other countries show unvaccinated pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized, develop pneumonia and die from measles than those who are not pregnant. Measles also threatens the fetus or unborn baby. An infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature birth and cause low birth weight.</p><p>\"If there's one group of people you really need to avoid getting serious infections, it's pregnant women,\" said Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor of medicine at McMaster University.</p><p>In mid-March, Public HealthOntario started tracking the number of pregnant people infected with measles during the outbreak. Seven such cases at the time have grown to 34 in two months.</p><p>In response to a request by the Star, the agency provided figures for the number of pregnant cases admitted to hospital between Oct. 18, 2024, and April 29.</p><p>During that period, the province recorded 25 pregnant measles cases. Among those, six were hospitalized, including one admitted to the ICU. Five of those cases were unimmunized, while one case had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.</p><p>Some of the pregnant people infected with measles are likely part of specific populations that historically haven't been vaccinated, Bowdish said. Health officials have confirmed Mennonite, Amish and other communities with low immunization rates have the highest rates of disease in this outbreak.</p><p>Unvaccinated pregnant women may also be part of a cohort of young adults whose parents refused childhood immunizations following a now-invalidated study that falsely linked the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, Bowdish said. Research shows the study, published in 1998 and since retracted, was associated with a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine.</p><p>\"There's a worry that there are quite a few people (of child-bearing age) who weren't vaccinated or who don't know their vaccine status, because you can't remember what Mom and Dad did when you were a child,\" Bowdish said.</p><p>She noted people who are thinking of starting a family don't typically check their MMR vaccination status. Up until this outbreak, there was a low risk of getting a measles infection in Ontario.</p><p>\"My big concern is that we're in this terrible situation, where we know people aren't vaccinated, where we're seeing measles spread into more and more communities, leading to more and more opportunities for pregnant people to get infected,\" said Bowdish.</p><p>Vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems are also at risk of infection during pregnancy, said Barton.</p><p>\"The new group that we're seeing ... is women who have now come to their adult years and were never vaccinated,\" she said. \"This is distinctly different from the pre-vaccine era where those women would have acquired natural immunity in childhood.\"</p><p>Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, said changes in a person's immune system during pregnancy make them generally more susceptible to infections, which is why it's important to update vaccines before starting a family.</p><p>Once pregnant, individuals aren't generally immunized against measles out of an abundance of caution because the shot, which is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, poses a theoretical risk to a fetus, El-Chaar said.</p><p>Unimmunized pregnant people who get exposed to measles are offered immunoglobulin (Ig), which consists of antibodies made from donated human blood and offers protection from infection, or reduces disease severity. Ig must be giving as early as possible after exposure and within a six-day window.</p><p>El-Chaar, a subject-matter expert for the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, said keeping up strong herd immunity is critical.</p><p>\"I wish people would understand that when we refuse vaccines when we can take them, we're making it worse for those who can't be vaccinated,\" she said.</p><p>At the start of the outbreak, Barton said she scoured the medical literature for clues on how measles would affect pregnant patients and their unborn babies. Though there are few recent reports, Barton said a U.S. study from 1993 found that about 60 per cent of unimmunized pregnant women with measles needed hospital care, with 27 per cent getting sick with pneumonia.</p><p>Since measles increases the risk of pregnancy loss and premature birth, Barton said she looked for guidance on these complications, too. One 2014 study from Namibia showed that 30 per cent of unvaccinated pregnant women exposed to the virus would go into labour within seven days, and 50 per cent would deliver within three weeks.   </p><p>Barton, who confirmed London Health Sciences Centre was managing the bulk of complicated cases in the region, would not reveal how many pregnant measles patients and their babies the hospital has cared for during the outbreak due to patient privacy concerns. Instead, she stressed how hard she and her colleagues are working to care for these vulnerable patients.</p><p>\"We're still at the height of things, but we're determined to find the answers.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CATHIE-2025052075533926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CATHIE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVH-TKD3-S9HH-H0RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 St. Catharine's Standard All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard (St. Catharines, Ontario) Online</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 20, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX002094</classCode><className>MEASLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

As of May 13, the outbreak has led to at least 1,622 cases, including 119 who have been hospitalized, according to Public HealthOntario. Of those hospitalized, 89 were unimmunized children.</p><p>Though kids have borne the brunt, adults are also getting sick. At least 377 people 20 and older, about two-thirds of whom were not vaccinated, have now been infected with what is typically thought of as a childhood disease. </p><p>Before routine immunization programs slashed measles cases in Canada, few people would get to child-bearing age without natural immunity. Now, in the post-vaccine era, people who did not get vaccinated as children have grown up to become \"vulnerable hosts,\" said Barton.</p><p>\"In a full-blown outbreak, with measles circulating in their community, (unvaccinated) pregnant women are at risk.\"</p><p>Studies from other countries show unvaccinated pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized, develop pneumonia and die from measles than those who are not pregnant. Measles also threatens the fetus or unborn baby. An infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature birth and cause low birth weight.</p><p>\"If there's one group of people you really need to avoid getting serious infections, it's pregnant women,\" said Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor of medicine at McMaster University.</p><p>In mid-March, Public HealthOntario started tracking the number of pregnant people infected with measles during the outbreak. Seven such cases at the time have grown to 34 in two months.</p><p>In response to a request by the Star, the agency provided figures for the number of pregnant cases admitted to hospital between Oct. 18, 2024, and April 29.</p><p>During that period, the province recorded 25 pregnant measles cases. Among those, six were hospitalized, including one admitted to the ICU. Five of those cases were unimmunized, while one case had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.</p><p>Some of the pregnant people infected with measles are likely part of specific populations that historically haven't been vaccinated, Bowdish said. Health officials have confirmed Mennonite, Amish and other communities with low immunization rates have the highest rates of disease in this outbreak.</p><p>Unvaccinated pregnant women may also be part of a cohort of young adults whose parents refused childhood immunizations following a now-invalidated study that falsely linked the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, Bowdish said. Research shows the study, published in 1998 and since retracted, was associated with a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine.</p><p>\"There's a worry that there are quite a few people (of child-bearing age) who weren't vaccinated or who don't know their vaccine status, because you can't remember what Mom and Dad did when you were a child,\" Bowdish said.</p><p>She noted people who are thinking of starting a family don't typically check their MMR vaccination status. Up until this outbreak, there was a low risk of getting a measles infection in Ontario.</p><p>\"My big concern is that we're in this terrible situation, where we know people aren't vaccinated, where we're seeing measles spread into more and more communities, leading to more and more opportunities for pregnant people to get infected,\" said Bowdish.</p><p>Vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems are also at risk of infection during pregnancy, said Barton.</p><p>\"The new group that we're seeing ... is women who have now come to their adult years and were never vaccinated,\" she said. \"This is distinctly different from the pre-vaccine era where those women would have acquired natural immunity in childhood.\"</p><p>Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, said changes in a person's immune system during pregnancy make them generally more susceptible to infections, which is why it's important to update vaccines before starting a family.</p><p>Once pregnant, individuals aren't generally immunized against measles out of an abundance of caution because the shot, which is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, poses a theoretical risk to a fetus, El-Chaar said.</p><p>Unimmunized pregnant people who get exposed to measles are offered immunoglobulin (Ig), which consists of antibodies made from donated human blood and offers protection from infection, or reduces disease severity. Ig must be giving as early as possible after exposure and within a six-day window.</p><p>El-Chaar, a subject-matter expert for the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, said keeping up strong herd immunity is critical.</p><p>\"I wish people would understand that when we refuse vaccines when we can take them, we're making it worse for those who can't be vaccinated,\" she said.</p><p>At the start of the outbreak, Barton said she scoured the medical literature for clues on how measles would affect pregnant patients and their unborn babies. Though there are few recent reports, Barton said a U.S. study from 1993 found that about 60 per cent of unimmunized pregnant women with measles needed hospital care, with 27 per cent getting sick with pneumonia.</p><p>Since measles increases the risk of pregnancy loss and premature birth, Barton said she looked for guidance on these complications, too. One 2014 study from Namibia showed that 30 per cent of unvaccinated pregnant women exposed to the virus would go into labour within seven days, and 50 per cent would deliver within three weeks.   </p><p>Barton, who confirmed London Health Sciences Centre was managing the bulk of complicated cases in the region, would not reveal how many pregnant measles patients and their babies the hospital has cared for during the outbreak due to patient privacy concerns. Instead, she stressed how hard she and her colleagues are working to care for these vulnerable patients.</p><p>\"We're still at the height of things, but we're determined to find the answers.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTRI-2025052075533887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTRI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVH-TKD3-S9HH-H0VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Welland Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Welland Tribune (Ontario) Online</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 20, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX002094</classCode><className>MEASLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

As of May 13, the outbreak has led to at least 1,622 cases, including 119 who have been hospitalized, according to Public HealthOntario. Of those hospitalized, 89 were unimmunized children.</p><p>Though kids have borne the brunt, adults are also getting sick. At least 377 people 20 and older, about two-thirds of whom were not vaccinated, have now been infected with what is typically thought of as a childhood disease. </p><p>Before routine immunization programs slashed measles cases in Canada, few people would get to child-bearing age without natural immunity. Now, in the post-vaccine era, people who did not get vaccinated as children have grown up to become \"vulnerable hosts,\" said Barton.</p><p>\"In a full-blown outbreak, with measles circulating in their community, (unvaccinated) pregnant women are at risk.\"</p><p>Studies from other countries show unvaccinated pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized, develop pneumonia and die from measles than those who are not pregnant. Measles also threatens the fetus or unborn baby. An infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature birth and cause low birth weight.</p><p>\"If there's one group of people you really need to avoid getting serious infections, it's pregnant women,\" said Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor of medicine at McMaster University.</p><p>In mid-March, Public HealthOntario started tracking the number of pregnant people infected with measles during the outbreak. Seven such cases at the time have grown to 34 in two months.</p><p>In response to a request by the Star, the agency provided figures for the number of pregnant cases admitted to hospital between Oct. 18, 2024, and April 29.</p><p>During that period, the province recorded 25 pregnant measles cases. Among those, six were hospitalized, including one admitted to the ICU. Five of those cases were unimmunized, while one case had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.</p><p>Some of the pregnant people infected with measles are likely part of specific populations that historically haven't been vaccinated, Bowdish said. Health officials have confirmed Mennonite, Amish and other communities with low immunization rates have the highest rates of disease in this outbreak.</p><p>Unvaccinated pregnant women may also be part of a cohort of young adults whose parents refused childhood immunizations following a now-invalidated study that falsely linked the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, Bowdish said. Research shows the study, published in 1998 and since retracted, was associated with a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine.</p><p>\"There's a worry that there are quite a few people (of child-bearing age) who weren't vaccinated or who don't know their vaccine status, because you can't remember what Mom and Dad did when you were a child,\" Bowdish said.</p><p>She noted people who are thinking of starting a family don't typically check their MMR vaccination status. Up until this outbreak, there was a low risk of getting a measles infection in Ontario.</p><p>\"My big concern is that we're in this terrible situation, where we know people aren't vaccinated, where we're seeing measles spread into more and more communities, leading to more and more opportunities for pregnant people to get infected,\" said Bowdish.</p><p>Vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems are also at risk of infection during pregnancy, said Barton.</p><p>\"The new group that we're seeing ... is women who have now come to their adult years and were never vaccinated,\" she said. \"This is distinctly different from the pre-vaccine era where those women would have acquired natural immunity in childhood.\"</p><p>Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, said changes in a person's immune system during pregnancy make them generally more susceptible to infections, which is why it's important to update vaccines before starting a family.</p><p>Once pregnant, individuals aren't generally immunized against measles out of an abundance of caution because the shot, which is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, poses a theoretical risk to a fetus, El-Chaar said.</p><p>Unimmunized pregnant people who get exposed to measles are offered immunoglobulin (Ig), which consists of antibodies made from donated human blood and offers protection from infection, or reduces disease severity. Ig must be giving as early as possible after exposure and within a six-day window.</p><p>El-Chaar, a subject-matter expert for the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, said keeping up strong herd immunity is critical.</p><p>\"I wish people would understand that when we refuse vaccines when we can take them, we're making it worse for those who can't be vaccinated,\" she said.</p><p>At the start of the outbreak, Barton said she scoured the medical literature for clues on how measles would affect pregnant patients and their unborn babies. Though there are few recent reports, Barton said a U.S. study from 1993 found that about 60 per cent of unimmunized pregnant women with measles needed hospital care, with 27 per cent getting sick with pneumonia.</p><p>Since measles increases the risk of pregnancy loss and premature birth, Barton said she looked for guidance on these complications, too.

Five of those cases were unimmunized, while one case had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.</p><p>Some of the pregnant people infected with measles are likely part of specific populations that historically haven't been vaccinated, Bowdish said.

As of May 13, the outbreak has led to at least 1,622 cases, including 119 who have been hospitalized, according to Public HealthOntario. Of those hospitalized, 89 were unimmunized children.</p><p>Though kids have borne the brunt, adults are also getting sick. At least 377 people 20 and older, about two-thirds of whom were not vaccinated, have now been infected with what is typically thought of as a childhood disease. </p><p>Before routine immunization programs slashed measles cases in Canada, few people would get to child-bearing age without natural immunity. Now, in the post-vaccine era, people who did not get vaccinated as children have grown up to become \"vulnerable hosts,\" said Barton.</p><p>\"In a full-blown outbreak, with measles circulating in their community, (unvaccinated) pregnant women are at risk.\"</p><p>Studies from other countries show unvaccinated pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized, develop pneumonia and die from measles than those who are not pregnant. Measles also threatens the fetus or unborn baby. An infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature birth and cause low birth weight.</p><p>\"If there's one group of people you really need to avoid getting serious infections, it's pregnant women,\" said Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor of medicine at McMaster University.</p><p>In mid-March, Public HealthOntario started tracking the number of pregnant people infected with measles during the outbreak. Seven such cases at the time have grown to 34 in two months.</p><p>In response to a request by the Star, the agency provided figures for the number of pregnant cases admitted to hospital between Oct. 18, 2024, and April 29.</p><p>During that period, the province recorded 25 pregnant measles cases. Among those, six were hospitalized, including one admitted to the ICU. Five of those cases were unimmunized, while one case had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.</p><p>Some of the pregnant people infected with measles are likely part of specific populations that historically haven't been vaccinated, Bowdish said. Health officials have confirmed Mennonite, Amish and other communities with low immunization rates have the highest rates of disease in this outbreak.</p><p>Unvaccinated pregnant women may also be part of a cohort of young adults whose parents refused childhood immunizations following a now-invalidated study that falsely linked the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, Bowdish said. Research shows the study, published in 1998 and since retracted, was associated with a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine.</p><p>\"There's a worry that there are quite a few people (of child-bearing age) who weren't vaccinated or who don't know their vaccine status, because you can't remember what Mom and Dad did when you were a child,\" Bowdish said.</p><p>She noted people who are thinking of starting a family don't typically check their MMR vaccination status. Up until this outbreak, there was a low risk of getting a measles infection in Ontario.</p><p>\"My big concern is that we're in this terrible situation, where we know people aren't vaccinated, where we're seeing measles spread into more and more communities, leading to more and more opportunities for pregnant people to get infected,\" said Bowdish.</p><p>Vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems are also at risk of infection during pregnancy, said Barton.</p><p>\"The new group that we're seeing ... is women who have now come to their adult years and were never vaccinated,\" she said. \"This is distinctly different from the pre-vaccine era where those women would have acquired natural immunity in childhood.\"</p><p>Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, said changes in a person's immune system during pregnancy make them generally more susceptible to infections, which is why it's important to update vaccines before starting a family.</p><p>Once pregnant, individuals aren't generally immunized against measles out of an abundance of caution because the shot, which is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, poses a theoretical risk to a fetus, El-Chaar said.</p><p>Unimmunized pregnant people who get exposed to measles are offered immunoglobulin (Ig), which consists of antibodies made from donated human blood and offers protection from infection, or reduces disease severity.

Up until this outbreak, there was a low risk of getting a measles infection in Ontario.</p><p>\"My big concern is that we're in this terrible situation, where we know people aren't vaccinated, where we're seeing measles spread into more and more communities, leading to more and more opportunities for pregnant people to get infected,\" said Bowdish.</p><p>Vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems are also at risk of infection during pregnancy, said Barton.</p><p>\"The new group that we're seeing ... is women who have now come to their adult years and were never vaccinated,\" she said. \"This is distinctly different from the pre-vaccine era where those women would have acquired natural immunity in childhood.\"</p><p>Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, said changes in a person's immune system during pregnancy make them generally more susceptible to infections, which is why it's important to update vaccines before starting a family.</p><p>Once pregnant, individuals aren't generally immunized against measles out of an abundance of caution because the shot, which is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, poses a theoretical risk to a fetus, El-Chaar said.</p><p>Unimmunized pregnant people who get exposed to measles are offered immunoglobulin (Ig), which consists of antibodies made from donated human blood and offers protection from infection, or reduces disease severity. Ig must be giving as early as possible after exposure and within a six-day window.</p><p>El-Chaar, a subject-matter expert for the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, said keeping up strong herd immunity is critical.</p><p>\"I wish people would understand that when we refuse vaccines when we can take them, we're making it worse for those who can't be vaccinated,\" she said.</p><p>At the start of the outbreak, Barton said she scoured the medical literature for clues on how measles would affect pregnant patients and their unborn babies. Though there are few recent reports, Barton said a U.S. study from 1993 found that about 60 per cent of unimmunized pregnant women with measles needed hospital care, with 27 per cent getting sick with pneumonia.</p><p>Since measles increases the risk of pregnancy loss and premature birth, Barton said she looked for guidance on these complications, too. One 2014 study from Namibia showed that 30 per cent of unvaccinated pregnant women exposed to the virus would go into labour within seven days, and 50 per cent would deliver within three weeks.   </p><p>Barton, who confirmed London Health Sciences Centre was managing the bulk of complicated cases in the region, would not reveal how many pregnant measles patients and their babies the hospital has cared for during the outbreak due to patient privacy concerns. Instead, she stressed how hard she and her colleagues are working to care for these vulnerable patients.</p><p>\"We're still at the height of things, but we're determined to find the answers.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2025052075533876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVH-TKD3-S9HH-H0KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Instead, a good start would be arranging with the Salmon Arm Fire Department to have a free FireSmart assessment done on your property.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There are trees allowed within the FireSmart model,\" said Salmon Arm firefighter Tyler Stevenson, who looks after public education and training.</p><p>With trees, the FireSmart Landscaping Guide advises looking after ladder fuels, which includes pruning all lower tree branches two metres from the ground. Plant trees and shrubs should be away from buildings to ensure branches do not touch or hang over roofs. Also, said Stevenson, trees on a property should be three metres apart, measured from the outskirts of their branches.</p><p>Stevenson has seen a growing interest in FireSmart landscaping in Salmon Arm since the destructive 2023 wildfire in the North Shuswap. However, he said FireSmart assessments tend to get homeowners thinking not about drastic measures, such as removing trees around the property, but about things that can be done along the outside walls of the structure.</p><p>\"What I find when I go to most houses is they want to focus on the outskirts of their property, not recognizing that right up against the house is where we really need to start our focus \u2013 cleaning the gutters out, all the little alcoves where the leaves build up, cleaning up the wood debris piles that are stacked up against the house where you get firewood from, all those things \u2013 getting those flammable products away from the home.</p><p>\"It's not the forest fire that tends to take structures inside a community, especially a community like Salmon Arm, it's usually the ember storm that comes ahead of those fires. Those are the ignitions that FireSmart is essentially trying to prevent.\"</p><p>A key FireSmart goal is to keep combustible materials \u2013 from cedar hedges to cedar much \u2013 out of the \"immediate zone,\" a 1.5 metre (five foot) buffer area around the home/structure's periphery.</p><p>Stevenson noted the FireSmart Landscaping Guide offers plenty of options to keep your home's immediate zone, and the overall landscape, green. However, if you'd prefer to learn more about those options from a person, Stevenson said there are two plant/gardening stores in Salmon Arm that are part of what's called the FireSmart Plant Program. They include Buckerfield's and Meadow Brae Farms.</p><p>\"We basically bring in what is in the FireSmart book \u2013 we ordered all of our perennials based on FireSmart,\" said Myra Graham of Meadow Brae's garden centre. \"Our criteria is FireSmart, native and as drought resistant or as drought tolerant as possible. Obviously there are some exceptions in those categories and some cross-overs\u2026\"</p><p>Myra and daughter Heather Graham own and operate Meadow Brae.</p><p>\"She is the landscape architect and horticulturist and I'm the gardener and mother,\" said Myra. \"I bring a little bit of experience into the business along with the love of doing it.\"</p><p>Along with a wealth of FireSmart friendly gardening/landscaping advice, the mother/daughter duo share the view that \"clear-cutting\" around the house is not the best approach.</p><p>\"What we're working on is the complete opposite of that kind of idea, it's working with plants and with nature instead of against\u2026,\" said Heather. \"One thing we're trying to say is that it doesn't take away the beauty of your garden, it doesn't take away the joy, it's just about changing your focus, your selection of plants.\"</p><p>Some FireSmart landscaping suggestions from Meadow Brae: transition from bark mulch to living mulch, with ground cover plants such as snow-in-summer or creeping thyme.</p><p>\"Low creeping plants that fill that space and quash the weeds, that kind of has the same effect as the mulch but doesn't have the same ignition point,\" said Heather.</p><p>Myra noted drought-tolerant plants still require initial watering, stressing they only become drought tolerant once they're established.</p><p>\"Once you plant them, that doesn't mean they're water tolerant and we don't need to water them,\" said Myra. \"They do need to establish and the way people water things helps with that. You want to encourage the roots to go deeper, so watering them every day is really counterproductive. You want to almost stress the plant a little bit before you start watering again \u2013 not quite, there's a fine line between that. But you do want them to search for deeper water and then when you do water, you want to water really thoroughly.\"</p><p>Like Stevenson, Heather and Myra have seen a growing interest in growing FireSmart, and the two strongly recommend having an assessment done.</p><p>\"I think the biggest message that I'd like people to have is do an assessment \u2013 don't be afraid of it,\" said Myra, noting an assessment was done on their farm property. \"It's actually a relief. I was one of those people that was afraid \u2013 we have 150-year old cedar trees and coniferous trees around here and I thought they're going ot tell me to cut all of that down immediately and that's not the case.\"</p><p>Heather said they've put in about 100 hours of FireSmart work in at the farm, adding it's not something that is expected to happen overnight.</p><p>\"It's something where you can nip away at the more important aspects,\" said Heather. \"It's important to have these things done. maybe not annually, maybe bi-annually, just to make sure that you are going in the right direction. Most people come in and think, 'oh, he's going to tell me about this tree,' but it's actually the pile of wood you have next to your house that's the problem.\"</p><p>On Saturday, May 25, Meadow Brae Farms, at 1630 51st Street NE, is hosting a FireSmart information day from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The session will include guest speakers from the Salmon Arm Fire Department and landscaping program who will answer questions and provide \"relevant information and help all of us to get through the fire seasons safely every summer.\"</p><p>For more FireSmart information, visit firesmartbc.ca.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20250513PSB4723619</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FT3-V3V3-RRSG-T0D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The March 30 event will fund the branch\u2019s training and equipment.\u00a0</p><p>Like other SAR programs around the province, the Pemberton dispatch is staffed with volunteers who maintain professional certifications. And while general search-and-rescue programs are often paid for by the Justice Institute, the more specialized, complicated disciplines require funds.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge that we have is maintaining a volunteer base where all of the certifications that everybody has are professional,\u201d said PSAR president David MacKenzie. \u201cSo we have to maintain a professional slate of qualifications\u2014everything from our rope teams, to our swift water teams, to the advanced medical care that our teams have, as well as all the basics in our search techniques and communications.\u201d</p><p>PSAR has about 40 volunteer members, seven of whom are based in the Lillooet area. Together, they manage one of the largest search areas in the province, stretching 25,000 square kilometres from the ocean, halfway to Kamloops on the north side, to the head of Harrison Lake on the east side, down to Whistler. And because Whistler doesn\u2019t have a swift water rescue team, the Pemberton SAR also covers any water-related calls around the resort municipality.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have a massive territory to cover, and the complexity of the types of calls that we're getting\u2026 everything from your mountain bikers, hikers, people getting lost, to vehicles going off the highway over embankments,\" said MacKenzie. \u201cThere's a myriad of different types of calls that we get.\"</p><p>At its peak, MacKenzie said PSAR was receiving between 70 and 80 calls, annually. Those calls have dropped off, MacKenzie suggests, due to lower snowfall, making conditions less dangerous for backcountry skiers and hikers, as well as forest fire season making folks want to stay indoors. Public education, particularly around Joffre Lakes Provincial Park, also plays a role in mitigating emergencies. Still, there\u2019s plenty of work for PSAR.</p><p>In addition to having plenty of calls to respond to, PSAR's equipment gets above-average wear and tear on it, due to the team's constant training for action.</p><p>\u201cWe're continually doing training, So it's not like the equipment is just sitting there not being used unless we're on a call. We train constantly,\" MacKenzie said. \"So our gear is being used and worked on all the time. And a lot of different components of our equipment will time out, they have a certain shelf life.\u201d</p><p>This year marks PSAR\u2019s first Pancake Breakfast. The inaugural event will be held Sunday, March 30 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Sunstone Golf Club. In addition to fluffy pancakes, the event will feature live music by Evan Phillips. The recommended donation is $10.</p><p>           Check out the event\u2019s Facebook page for more information.         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-391d41ab39104128a07ff70ec082f073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC9-HSW3-RV7P-J05G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><timeReceived>08:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 18, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009PZU</classCode><className>CALENDARS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A3I2</classCode><className>EXTREME SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001575</classCode><className>SKIING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DHVK</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000800</classCode><className>GOLF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D8OY</classCode><className>MOUNTAIN BIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

For the sake of the turtles, fish and our lake, I hope we\u2019re smarter than in 2003.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20250410PTDA0004695715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ2-T0H3-RS39-93KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Instead, a good start would be arranging with the Salmon Arm Fire Department to have a free FireSmart assessment done on your property.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There are trees allowed within the FireSmart model,\" said Salmon Arm firefighter Tyler Stevenson, who looks after public education and training.</p><p>With trees, the FireSmart Landscaping Guide advises looking after ladder fuels, which includes pruning all lower tree branches two metres from the ground. Plant trees and shrubs should be away from buildings to ensure branches do not touch or hang over roofs. Also, said Stevenson, trees on a property should be three metres apart, measured from the outskirts of their branches.</p><p>Stevenson has seen a growing interest in FireSmart landscaping in Salmon Arm since the destructive 2023 wildfire in the North Shuswap. However, he said FireSmart assessments tend to get homeowners thinking not about drastic measures, such as removing trees around the property, but about things that can be done along the outside walls of the structure.</p><p>\"What I find when I go to most houses is they want to focus on the outskirts of their property, not recognizing that right up against the house is where we really need to start our focus \u2013 cleaning the gutters out, all the little alcoves where the leaves build up, cleaning up the wood debris piles that are stacked up against the house where you get firewood from, all those things \u2013 getting those flammable products away from the home.</p><p>\"It's not the forest fire that tends to take structures inside a community, especially a community like Salmon Arm, it's usually the ember storm that comes ahead of those fires. Those are the ignitions that FireSmart is essentially trying to prevent.\"</p><p>A key FireSmart goal is to keep combustible materials \u2013 from cedar hedges to cedar much \u2013 out of the \"immediate zone,\" a 1.5 metre (five foot) buffer area around the home/structure's periphery.</p><p>Stevenson noted the FireSmart Landscaping Guide offers plenty of options to keep your home's immediate zone, and the overall landscape, green. However, if you'd prefer to learn more about those options from a person, Stevenson said there are two plant/gardening stores in Salmon Arm that are part of what's called the FireSmart Plant Program. They include Buckerfield's and Meadow Brae Farms.</p><p>\"We basically bring in what is in the FireSmart book \u2013 we ordered all of our perennials based on FireSmart,\" said Myra Graham of Meadow Brae's garden centre. \"Our criteria is FireSmart, native and as drought resistant or as drought tolerant as possible. Obviously there are some exceptions in those categories and some cross-overs\u2026\"</p><p>Graham and daughter Heather Conti own and operate Meadow Brae.</p><p>\"She is the landscape architect and horticulturist and I'm the gardener and mother,\" said Graham. \"I bring a little bit of experience into the business along with the love of doing it.\"</p><p>Along with a wealth of FireSmart friendly gardening/landscaping advice, the mother/daughter duo share the view that \"clear-cutting\" around the house is not the best approach.</p><p>\"What we're working on is the complete opposite of that kind of idea, it's working with plants and with nature instead of against\u2026,\" said Conti. \"One thing we're trying to say is that it doesn't take away the beauty of your garden, it doesn't take away the joy, it's just about changing your focus, your selection of plants.\"</p><p>Some FireSmart landscaping suggestions from Meadow Brae: transition from bark mulch to living mulch, with ground cover plants such as snow-in-summer or creeping thyme.</p><p>\"Low creeping plants that fill that space and quash the weeds, that kind of has the same effect as the mulch but doesn't have the same ignition point,\" said Conti.</p><p>Graham noted drought-tolerant plants still require initial watering, stressing they only become drought tolerant once they're established.</p><p>\"Once you plant them, that doesn't mean they're water tolerant and we don't need to water them,\" said Graham. \"They do need to establish and the way people water things helps with that. You want to encourage the roots to go deeper, so watering them every day is really counterproductive. You want to almost stress the plant a little bit before you start watering again \u2013 not quite, there's a fine line between that. But you do want them to search for deeper water and then when you do water, you want to water really thoroughly.\"</p><p>Like Stevenson, Conti and Graham have seen a growing interest in growing FireSmart, and the two strongly recommend having an assessment done.</p><p>\"I think the biggest message that I'd like people to have is do an assessment \u2013 don't be afraid of it,\" said Graham, noting an assessment was done on their farm property. \"It's actually a relief. I was one of those people that was afraid \u2013 we have 150-year old cedar trees and coniferous trees around here and I thought they're going ot tell me to cut all of that down immediately and that's not the case.\"</p><p>Conti said they've put in about 100 hours of FireSmart work in at the farm, adding it's not something that is expected to happen overnight.</p><p>\"It's something where you can nip away at the more important aspects,\" said Conti. \"It's important to have these things done. maybe not annually, maybe bi-annually, just to make sure that you are going in the right direction. Most people come in and think, 'oh, he's going to tell me about this tree,' but it's actually the pile of wood you have next to your house that's the problem.\"</p><p>On Saturday, May 25, Meadow Brae Farms, at 1630 51st Street NE, is hosting a FireSmart information day from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The session will include guest speakers from the Salmon Arm Fire Department and landscaping program who will answer questions and provide \"relevant information and help all of us to get through the fire seasons safely every summer.\"</p><p>For more FireSmart information, visit firesmartbc.ca.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20250509PSB4723619</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FSB-M6M3-RWBW-20C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Three documented MODS mineral showings occur on the Property; 1) Antimony Ridge Showing; 2) Golden Grit Showing; and 3) Southeast Brook Silver Showing. Most of the work (trenching and sampling) has focused on the Golden Grit Showing. However, none of these 3 showings have ever been drilled. Furthermore, an Sb mineralized boulder trains has been outlined. Exploration planning is underway to locate the bedrock source.</p><p>Antimony and Gold Markets Commentary</p><p>Reuters reported on June 17th, 20253 that China severely restricted antimony exports, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $60,000 per metric tonne, having more than quadrupled over the past year. As a critical metal, antimony's market dynamics are influenced by its applications in various industries and geopolitical factors. China's recent antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal. Approximately 70% of antimony is produced or refined in China.</p><p>Spot gold prices have traded as high as US$3,500 per ounce, likely driven by heightened global uncertainties and increased demand from institutional and retail investors. Central banks have continued their robust gold purchasing in 2025, adding 244 tonnes to their global reserves in Q1 and maintaining a strong pace into Q2, putting them on track for approximately 1,000 tonnes of purchases for the year. This sustained buying action underscores gold's role as a strategic asset amid economic instability and inflation concerns. Retail investors and family offices have also increased their gold holdings, seeking to hedge against market volatility. In Q1 2025, gold ETF inflows surged by 1,114% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 226.5 tonnes. Despite some outflows in May, year-to-date ETF inflows remain strong at over 322 tonnes, reflecting a continued revival in retail appetite for gold.</p><p>The convergence of these factors highlights the strategic importance of antimony and gold antimony on the current global economic landscape.</p><p>3 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/\">https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/</url></p><p>NAM's Strategic Sb-Au Land Position</p><p>NAM's properties in Newfoundland amount to approximately 19,800 hectares in 11 non-contiguous properties.

The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>About NAM's Lithium Division</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB.This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities.Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and mid-tier mining companies through to production.</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for its River Valley Palladium Project and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are welcome to visit the New Age Metals website at ./../../../01.%20MyWork/NAM/Marketing/01.%20Press%20Releases/2025/2025-07-07/02.%20MyReview/<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

The community and its leaders now recognize how critical this work is after many years of hard lessons and public education.</p><p>In 2003, as homes around Kelowna burned, I was an initial attack firefighter for the province and I remember conversations in fire fighting circles about how the fire started in an area slated for prescribed burning to reduce fuel loading, but public concerns about impacts to air quality meant the political pressure not to burn left those fuels in place.</p><p>In 2010, as an initial attack crew leader, I remember the feeling in the pit of my stomach listening to a briefing about the potential for evacuating homes as a large forest fire threatened to cross the Fraser River near the Rudy Johnson bridge. It felt terrifying and frustrating both in equal measure.</p><p>How had we let things get this bad and why weren't we putting into practice the things we knew would make a difference? Fire experts and forest ecologists were calling for us to address the unhealthy balance in our forests caused by years of removing fire from the landscape. The Interior Douglas fir forests in the Cariboo Chilcotin are particularly adapted to fire.</p><p>By 2017, I was no longer a firefighter and wasn't living in Williams Lake, but I still felt frustration knowing in the seven years since 2010, we seemed no further ahead. This time, the evacuation happened, and the town had to face the very real threat fires pose in an unbalanced ecosystem.</p><p>Fast forward to now, and it is heartening to see the real progress being made, out on the trails, there are so many visible improvements to reduce fuel loading, following the recommendations of researchers based on science and experience.</p><p>Working to restore ecosystems in ways which allow us to live more in concert with our environment than in opposition will ensure we can continue to enjoy the benefits of having nature at our doorstep.</p><p>Leaders are finally listening to the advice of experts and believing the research in regards to Fire Smart and ecosystem restoration, so my question is, why not when it comes to the ecology of the lake?</p><p>The scientists and research shows the lake harvester is a band aid option which could even contribute to stimulating vegetation growth.</p><p>The only thing which will actually lead to a reduction in algal and vegetation growth in Williams Lake would be to address the input of nutrients, which includes from vast lawns and the removal of riparian vegetation.</p><p>The small areas of the swimming beach and boat launches named as safety concerns could be addressed through manual removal at a much more reasonable cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>But given our very human slow learning process, it makes one wonder if an ecological collapse of our lake is what it will take for leaders and staff to really listen.</p><p>Algal growth will not be stopped by removing the vegetation from the water, neither will warming temperatures impacting fish caused by the removal of riparian shade throughout the watershed.</p><p>The removal of plant growth using a large, expensive machine will not address the loss of oxygen in the deep layers of the lake as all of the organic materials break down. This oxygen depletion can kill fish.</p><p>Sigh. Will it take over 20 years for our community to begin to address the real issues, which are the human impacts on our watershed and nutrient input in the lake, or will we learn a little sooner this time? For the sake of the turtles, fish and our lake, I hope we're smarter than in 2003.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Williams Lake Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20250408PWL4712916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHM-V863-RS2G-7013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The group is inviting locals of all ages to submit art in any medium related to climate change, endangered species, or nature.</p><p>The chapter has been gathering on roughly a monthly basis since last fall, and has enjoyed the participation of a dedicated, diverse group of residents, Seniors for Climate organizer Nancy Taylor told The Goat.</p><p>With Earth Day coming up on April 22nd, the group thought it would be a good opportunity to educate locals about climate change and the environment, Taylor said. They settled on a week-long art show in McBride and Valemount as a way to include people of all ages in the activity, and because it\u2019s a positive way to get involved in climate change advocacy, she said.</p><p>\u201cPeople can submit whatever they like: a forest, or an animal. It doesn\u2019t have to be a forest fire or flood like mine was going to be,\u201d Taylor laughed. \u201cAnd we\u2019re encouraging people to include a short statement on what they\u2019ve chosen to submit.\u201d</p><p>Members of the group have circulated the callout for art to local schools, and school principals have been enthusiastic about the project, according to Taylor. Those interested can drop off their submissions at the Valley Museum and Archives in McBride, or at Infinity in Valemount, by April 11th.</p><p>The art show will open at the Valley Museum and Archives in McBride on April 22nd and then at the Valemount Museum on April 29th, though the group has not yet set an exact time for these openings. The openings will take place alongside a screening of \u201cLater is Too Late,\u201d a documentary about Seniors for Climate chapters across the country which features interviews from two members of the Robson Valley chapter, according to Taylor.</p><p>Aside from the art show, Taylor also looks forward to an \u201cElder/Youngster Nature Walk,\u201d to be held at the Dunster Schoolhouse on Saturday, April 26th. Led by Laurel Berg-Khoo \u2013 who recently received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from UNBC \u2013 the guided walk will show participants how to recognize the effects of climate change on the plants and ecosystem around them.</p><p>This emphasis on intergenerational communication is at the heart of many Seniors for Climate initiatives, Taylor said.</p><p>\u201cOur big priorities in this [are] two things: starting and having conversations about climate change, and number two is building community, getting together,\u201d Taylor said. She added that communicating with younger people is especially important since seniors have witnessed firsthand the way climate change has affected the Robson Valley.</p><p>The extensive lineup of Earth Week activities is ambitious, Taylor said, but she\u2019s optimistic that they will have a good reception. In any case, she says the Seniors for Climate group will continue meeting year-round and organizing similar events.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been really inspired by the fact that each person has a skill or a strength,\u201d Taylor added. We\u2019ve lived big lives \u2013 when you\u2019re in your 70s or 80s, you\u2019ve done so much and have a lot to contribute.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-196a38550aa841779ece50b35b33346f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDK-BR93-RVVX-H1CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"540\"/><timeReceived>06:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 24, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A093</classCode><className>EARTH DAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000613</classCode><className>ENDANGERED SPECIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0009JYC</classCode><className>CERTIFICATES, DEGREES &amp; DIPLOMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N923110CC</classCode><className>EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0009P1L</classCode><className>SCHOOL PRINCIPALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N610000CC</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
