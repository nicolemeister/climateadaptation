When thunderstorms caused by daytime heating move through the area, they can spark fires in the following day or two. On August 19, after one such storm cell tracked across the area from Nakusp to Golden, detectors recorded more than 1,000 lighting strikes within the Southeast Fire Centre.  Within three days, six new fires were burning just north of Trout Lake, and four in the high country near Nakusp. Dozens more burned around Revelstoke. </p><p>BCWS says its crews have prioritized these latest fires and are tackling them in order of importance. </p><p>Busy in the Southeast </p><p>The Southeast Fire Centre has been the province\u2019s literal \u2018hot spot\u2019 for forest fires this summer, with more than double the number of fires burning as the next busiest region, Kamloops. As the Valley Voice went to press Monday, 14 fires were burning in our readership area, and 72 in the Southeast Fire Centre as a whole. About 100 new fires have started in the SEFC in the last two weeks. </p><p>Few of the West Kootenay fires seem to have grown very quickly, however, as the cool, wet weather from earlier this spring has kept high-elevation forest fire fuel harder to burn. Fire crews on the ground and in the air have put down most of the fires soon after they were detected, with only a few local fires growing larger than a hectare or two. </p><p>Briggs Creek fire </p><p>The evacuation alert for the community of South Fork, issued August 1 because of the Briggs Creek fire, was rescinded August 22. Located about 11 kilometres west of Kaslo, this \u2018fire of note\u2019 is now listed at 2,160 hectares in size. </p><p>On Monday, 29 firefighters and one helicopter were working to establish and maintain a containment line to prevent the fire\u2019s spread. Most of the fire is in high, difficult terrain, making it impossible to action directly. BCWS says the fire behaviour is now consistently Rank 3 and 4 (moderate to highly vigorous surface fire), with crown fire being noted more commonly at higher elevations.  </p><p>\u201cDespite the increase in fire behaviour, it remains primarily at high elevation and well within control lines,\u201d says the firefighting agency.  </p><p>Mulvey Creek fire </p><p>The 18-hectare fire burning to the south and west of the Village of Slocan has remained stubbornly out of control for BCWS for more than a week. On Monday it was finally listed as \u2018being held.\u2019 </p><p>Slocan Bluffs fire </p><p>A 9.5-hectare fire near the highway just north of the village of Slocan was listed as \u2018under control\u2019 on Monday. At one point there was concern the fire could prompt the closure of Hwy 6, but water bombers and helicopters have kept the persistent fire down. </p><p>Besides Briggs Creek, four other \u2018fires of note\u2019 were burning in the SEFC on August 22, including ones near Invermere, Sparwood, Cranbrook and Radium Hot Springs. None of the fires, however, were threatening homes and structures. </p><p>The fires have prompted intermittent air quality warnings in the region.  </p><p>Just one other fire of note is listed by the BCWS \u2013 the Keremeos fire in the Kamloops fire district. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-df7af1fcf71e49558a569979ce317500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667P-TSV1-JBVR-312D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><timeReceived>06:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 25, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I recall stepping out of the office onto the parking lot and feeling the heat on the surface of my eyeballs.</p><p>This year we got the opposite. Instead of heat, we\u2019ve got below-average temps. Instead of crops literally cooking on the vine, we\u2019re worried it\u2019s too cold and damp for much to grow.</p><p>A powerful La Nina system is dumping cool and wet weather on us.</p><p>But this is closer to \u201cnormal\u201d weather for the coast than what we\u2019ve experienced for the last 20 years.</p><p>Go back to the late 19th and early 20th century and things really were cooler. According to provincial data, B.C. is up about 1.4 C per century since 1900. Winters in particular are milder, rising 2.2 C on average, with variations across the province.</p><p>Meanwhile, the region that includes the Lower Mainland has seen a 14 per cent increase in precipitation.</p><p>And that data is a few years old.</p><p>After the roller coaster of the past two years, with its record-breaking heat, cold and rain coming on each other\u2019s heels, they might have to update the charts a bit.</p><p>We\u2019re seeing more extremes in B.C. , it seems. When it\u2019s dry and hot, it\u2019s going to set off forest fires and heat alerts; when it\u2019s cold and wet, it\u2019s going to soak and chill us even more.</p><p>Yet I can\u2019t help but notice that the weather this year isn\u2019t all bad.</p><p>Sure, not great for a lot of berry crops, awful for orchards, probably pretty crummy for potatoes.</p><p>But mild temperatures and plenty of rain are pretty good for a lot of native plants. The weather we\u2019ve had this year is closer to the what was normal for this area before humans started burning coal and oil on a massive scale a century and a half ago.</p><p>But there is no normal anymore.</p><p>This year might be followed by one that\u2019s stifling and dry. Or cool and dry, or hot with sudden storms. Maybe we\u2019ll get a typhoon next, or another tornado like the waterspout last year that touched down just off of UBC.</p><p>If we knew what was normal, we might be able to better plan for the future, for our forest fire prevention needs, for agriculture, for flood prevention and disaster response.</p><p>But we broke normal. Climate change isn\u2019t some abstract thing that\u2019s going to happen in the future, it\u2019s here now.</p><p>The weather we grew up with wasn\u2019t quite normal. Our future weather will be even less so.</p><p>Matthew Claxton is a reporter with the Langley Advance Times, sister paper to the North Delta Reporter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NDREP-news20220714PRBA0002835723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NDREP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65XM-18D1-F0HF-84TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459604</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

And instead of basking in the July sun, people with respiratory and heart conditions have been advised to retreat indoors. To put it in a greater context, Toronto was named the fourth worst place for air quality earlier this week - in the entire world. Communities in and around the GTA have experienced poor air quality, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While on other occasions the fingers of blame would be pointed at the exhaust-belching cars, SUVs and trucks we drive, the main source of this dangerous pollution is the 170 forest fires now burning across Northern Ontario. And in case you didn't know, far from being an inevitable natural phenomenon, these fires can to a large degree be linked to humans.</p><p>To grasp the seriousness of the situation, consider its scope. There have been 3,925 wildfires recorded across Canada so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's well above the 10-year average. In Northern Ontario, the number and size of wildfires is already substantially higher than average and has forced thousands of people to flee their First Nations communities.</p><p>Across Canada, the area burned by wildfires each year has gradually doubled since the early 1970s, says Mike Flannigan, research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops. And modelling, he adds, suggests that area could again double - or even increase up to 11 times - by the end of this century. Forest-fire seasons have grown longer, too.</p><p>At this point, many readers will attribute these frightening trends to human-created climate change. And a large body of science indicates this is indeed a big factor. The rising temperatures and prolonged droughts associated with climate change dry forest debris into a kindling that can be ignited by a single lightning bolt. These are the conditions being experienced where wildfires are burning in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.</p><p>If Canadians needed another reason to step up their fight against global warming, this summer's wildfires and the lung-choking air pollution they have generated should provide an irrefutable one. But the wildfire smoke, with its particles and gases that contain chemicals harmful to human health, should lead to other action - in Canada's forests.</p><p>The ways we manage and mismanage this country's vast forested lands have made wildfires more, not less, likely. Ironically, when humans suppress fires they allow a buildup of underbrush and deadfall on forest floors. Researchers in British Columbia believe that in earlier centuries, naturally occurring forest fires of small- to-moderate size would consume much of that debris but leave large trees standing. So while it seems counterintuitive, such fires actually contributed to the overall health of a forest - protecting it from the larger wildfires we're witnessing this summer.</p><p>This explains why American President Joe Biden plans to double the work being done in the United States each year to protect forests by cleaning out deadfall and employing prescribed burns. These are planned, small-scale fires that mimic the former natural cycle. Such proactive measures should become more commonplace in this country.</p><p>Even if that happens, the accelerating impacts of climate change suggest no quick fix lies on our smoggy horizons. For now, those most vulnerable to polluted air, especially the very young, very old and people with serious medical conditions, will have to change their behaviour when faraway forests burn. But long-term, Canadians simply can't let this become our \"new normal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-news20210729THSW395c1ec7f99340fc8fbb297abb03c78f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6380-56N1-JDV5-F1F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Current projections indicate that this may continue to be a significantly challenging summer for wildfires in parts of the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most recent projections indicate a continued potential for higher-than-normal fire activity across most of the country throughout the 2023 Wildland fire season. This is due to long-range forecasts for warm temperatures and ongoing drought, which are affecting parts of all provinces and territories and intensifying in some regions. For July, warm and dry conditions will increase wildfire risk from British Columbia and Yukon through to western Labrador. During August, the area at risk will stretch from British Columbia through western Quebec.</p><p>Following a technical briefing on the updated July wildfire modelling, the Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness; the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Health; and Julie Dzerowicz, Member of Parliament for Davenport; and Dr. Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, provided an update on the current wildfire situation and on the actions that the Government of Canada is taking to support communities and prepare them for future seasons. The government has already taken key steps to respond to the 2023 wildfire season, such as making additional investments to train more firefighters and provide support to provinces and territories on equipment and deploying Canadian Armed Forces personnel and capabilities. Today, Ministers announced two new steps to strengthen Canada's response. This includes the upgrading of a National Fire Equipment Cache in Banff National Park to act as a central equipment repository for Parks Canada and augment local equipment reserves in national parks across the country.The Ministers also highlighted the announcement of the Canada Portugal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Wildland firefighting cooperation, which will help strengthen resources sharing between the two countries. Minister Duclos and Dr. Tam also spoke about ways that Canadians can keep themselves safe, including from wildfire smoke, over the course of the summer.</p><p>Keeping Canadians safe and healthy is the first priority of the Government of Canada. We are working with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and our international allies to continue to fight these wildfires while protecting homes, livelihoods and lives.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"In the face of the worst wildfire season on record, Canadians can be certain that their government will be there to support them. While current forecasts show that the remaining months of the 2023 wildfire season will continue to be challenging, the federal government is working with all our partners   provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and our international allies   to keep Canadians safe and healthy. Coupled with long-term investments in wildfire fighting as well as climate mitigation and adaptation, Canada will continue to protect homes, livelihoods and communities while also addressing the root cause of these intensified fires: climate change.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Natural Resources </p><p>\"From personal losses and evacuation orders to poor air quality   Canadians right across the country have felt the impacts of this challenging wildfire season. The federal government is working closely with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners to ensure they have the supports and resources needed to manage the fires and mitigate their effect on our communities. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre is coordinating international deployments, and we are grateful for the assistance Canada has received from around the world and for the tireless efforts of our Canadian firefighters and emergency management teams. From response to recovery, the Government of Canada will be there as we navigate the remainder of the season.\"</p><p>The Honourable Bill BlairPresident of the King's Privy Council and Minister of Emergency Preparedness</p><p>\"With 45 First Nation communities having already been affected, most recently in Ontario, this wildfire season has been more intense, severe and devastating than any other. As the impact of wildfires continues, Indigenous Services Canada will continue to support affected First Nations with evacuation efforts including paying 100 percent of eligible costs for wildfire evacuations. We will be there for as long as it takes to support affected communities and to help with the rebuilding effort. I give my sincerest thanks to the firefighters and first responders who are supporting people at this challenging time.\"</p><p>The Honourable Patty HajduMinister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"With this year being the worst wildfire season on record, Canada is facing unprecedented impacts from forest fires. From evacuations to poor air quality and extreme heat warnings, we are experiencing the reality of climate change effects. We are working closely with provinces and territories to reduce the risks posed by these events, including by sending air quality monitors and N95 masks to partners and communities across the country. To protect our health and well-being, we should all pay attention to the Air Quality Health Index and special air quality statements, reduce our exposure to wildfire smoke as much as possible, and stay hydrated and cool during heat waves.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jean-Yves DuclosMinister of Health</p><p>\"Wildfires are a threat that too many Canadians have felt the impact of. By coordinating with international partners, we are ensuring that Canada and its allies can rely on mutual assistance and resource sharing when needed most. This arrangement with the Portuguese Republic underscores our effective cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic and will advance our joint efforts to protect livelihoods and communities from intense wildfires. We are deeply grateful to the Portuguese Government for stepping up and supporting us during this difficult time.\"</p><p>Julie Dzerowicz Member of Parliament for Davenport</p><p> Quick FactsSeasonal wildfire forecasts use the most recent fire weather indexes and consider drought conditions and temperature and precipitation forecasts derived from two climate model ensembles known as the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS, operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada).Current information on national fire conditions is available publicly at all times through NRCan's Canadian Wildland Fire Information System.

As this year's unprecedented wildfire season continues in many provinces and territories, the Government of Canada is continuing to support Canadians now while strengthening the country's ability to adapt to a changing climate.</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, along with the Honourable Harjit Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada; the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence; the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services; the Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages; the Honourable Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs and Minister Responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and Prairies Economic Development Canada; and Michael McLeod, Member of Parliament for the Northwest Territories, today announced that more than $65 million in federal funding has been committed so far through for six agreements through the $256-million Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate - Equipment Fund. Single and multi-year agreements with Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories and Yukon will support the efforts of provinces and territories to strengthen capacities and capabilities in fire management across Canada by procuring specialized wildland firefighting equipment such as fire crew trucks and personal protective equipment.</p><p>The Ministers also announced that both British Columbia and the Northwest Territories recently signed agreements with the federal government to access the maximum available funding under this program. This will see federal contributions of over $28.5 million for the Northwest Territories and $32 million for British Columbia over five years. With funding already flowing this year, these newly expanded agreements will provide consistent support for British Columbia and the Northwest Territories to secure lifesaving equipment and personnel. The Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program provides $256 million over five years, starting 2022 2023, to support provinces and territories. The six agreements detailed today are the first of many that will further strengthen fire management capacities and capabilities across the country by facilitating the purchase of wildland firefighting equipment to increase capacity to respond and prepare for wildland fires.</p><p>These agreements build on important actions to date, including through the first phase of the Wildland Firefighter Training Fund that will train up to 630 firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians and pilot Responding to the Interface training for structural firefighters in partnership with the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). The Government of Canada has also announced a long-term investment in the one-of-a-kind WildFireSat satellite mission. Additionally, as outlined in the National Adaptation Strategy, the Government of Canada has committed to improving resilience strategies and preparedness efforts to reduce disaster risks.</p><p>Ministers Wilkinson,Sajjan, Hajdu, Boissonnault and Vandal and MP McLeod also provided an update on the actions that the Government of Canada has taken so far to support communities impacted and threatened by wildfires and how it will continue to support Canadians through this year's fire season and future seasons.</p><p>Also today, Government of Canada officials provided an updated forecast for the remainder of the 2023 wildfire season. Canada has leveraged its significant resources from coast to coast to coast this wildland fire season to respond to the considerable challenges Canadians are facing. Current forecasts indicate the possibility for increased wildland fire activity in central Canada during September, from eastern Alberta through to central Ontario. Fall is typically when new wildland fire occurrence begins to taper off due to cooler night temperatures and decreases in lightning activity. However, predictions for ongoing warm and dry weather may contribute to new fire starts, and there remains a likelihood that some existing large fires may continue to be active through September and possibly later into fall or winter.</p><p>By working together with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and our international allies, the federal government is supporting the fight against wildfires and combating the effects of climate change, while ensuring public safety and protecting homes, livelihoods and lives.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Throughout Canada's worst wildfire season, the federal government has been determined to support Canadians and at-risk communities. As wildfires continue to burn across Canada, we are providing over $65 million in funding to our territorial and provincial counterparts for life-saving equipment and important contracting. This means more resources and more boots on the ground in our fight against these intense and dangerous wildfires.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"Communities across the country are seeing their daily lives affected by an unprecedented wildfire season. Our government has stood by them and will continue to support them through these difficult times. Today's announcement will provide key support to provinces and territories, firefighters and the entire emergency management community who have been valiantly protecting the health and safety of Canadians since the beginning of this forest fire season.\"</p><p>The Honourable Harjit SajjanPresident of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada</p><p>\"In British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and across the country, Indigenous communities have been disproportionately impacted by a historically long and severe wildfire season, intensified by climate change. Today, we announced additional funding for firefighting efforts including to buy equipment to continue to fight wildfires. The federal government will be with First Nations every step of the way. We will continue to work with leaders and cover 100 percent of eligible costs for transportation, accommodation, food and mental wellness supports for evacuees. And as the hard work of rebuilding begins, we will be there to support that too.\"</p><p>The Honourable Patty HajduMinister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"This year's wildfire season has been unprecedented and devastating for communities across the country. Evacuations have disrupted the lives of tens of thousands of Canadians, including in many Indigenous communities. In spite of this, Canadians are responding as they always have, by coming together and supporting each other. That's who we are, and that's what we will continue to do.\"</p><p>The Honourable RandyBoissonnaultMinister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages</p><p>\"Northerners are resilient, and our government will continue to support them as they continue to face the harsh effects of climate change. This announcement will ensure the Northwest Territories has the resources it needs to fight the wildfires and protect their communities.\"</p><p>The Honourable Dan VandalMinister of Northern Affairs and Minister Responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and Prairies Economic Development Canada</p><p>\"This fire season has been incredibly challenging to residents of the Northwest Territories. The support provided by the Government of Canada has helped local efforts to keep our residents and communities safe. As many evacuated residents are beginning to return to their homes, it is critical that all levels of government work together to help the Northwest Territories rebuild and recover.\"</p><p>Michael McLeodMember of Parliament for the Northwest Territories</p><p>\"The Government of the Northwest Territories is incredibly grateful to be able to access its full notional allocation under the Government of Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate - Equipment Fund. This unprecedented wildfire season has impacted our land, our communities and our residents unlike ever before, and it is still very much ongoing. Our government is humbled by the amount of support it has received from the Government of Canada as well as from provincial, territorial and international partners this season. This generous support has increased our capacity to respond to and prepare for wildfires during the most challenging season in our territory's history.\"</p><p>The Honourable Shane ThompsonNorthwest Territories' Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, Minister Responsible for Youth </p><p>\"Too many people in British Columbia have had their lives upended by wildfire this year   one of our most devastating seasons ever. Some have lost their homes and livelihoods, and impacted communities will be rebuilding for many years to come. In recent years, we made the largest investment in British Columbia's history in wildfire prevention and our firefighting capacity, expanding the BC Wildfire Service's year-round operations and equipment. As we work to prepare for future fire seasons, we are grateful for additional support from the Government of Canada for much-needed equipment and supplies. These investments will be used to upgrade BC Wildfire Service fire camp infrastructure, equipment and mass water delivery systems, helping to ensure the organization is well equipped for future wildfire and natural hazard responses.\"</p><p>The Honourable Bruce RalstonBritish Columbia's Minister of Forests</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> Seasonal wildfire forecasts use the most recent fire weather indexes and consider drought conditions and temperature and precipitation forecasts derived from two climate model ensembles known as the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS), operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada).Current information on national fire conditions is available publicly at all times through Natural Resource Canada's Canadian Wildland Fire Information System.

Beyond the free barbecue, the day was filled with activities such as fire truck tours, firehose demonstrations, and children's activities.</p><p>\"One of our primary goals for this was simply to work with (Sc'ianew First Nation) and enjoy working together on a project. FireSmart has been that project we have been working on together to make both of our communities safer from wildfires and urban interface fires,\" said Metchosin Fire Chief Stephanie Dunlop. \"This is the second community barbecue, we did one in (Sc'ianew First Nation) last fall.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Metchosin fire chief shines a light on others</p><p>The FireSmart program is designed to help residents understand the steps they can take with their properties to reduce the chances of wildfires burning their homes and spreading even further.</p><p>One of the main things property owners should do is ensure there is a 1.5-metre non-combustible surface surrounding their home, which can be as simple as clearing vegetation down to the soil, or placing gravel, bricks, or other stones, said Dunlop. Woody shrubs, trees, and tree branches should be kept out of this area.</p><p>The materials used on the roof and siding of a home also play a major role in making a property as safe as possible, and the department had a handy prop setup at the barbecue to make it easy to visualize the best practices.</p><p>\"The prop demonstrates the ideal house, with the non-combustible metre and a half around it, having Hardie board planking on the side, non-combustible shingles, covers on the chimney, things like that,\" said Dunlop. \"The other parts of it show cedar shingles on the roof as being not as safe, and then the dirty roof covered in moss is the least safe.\"</p><p>Another key message the Metchosin Fire Department is hoping to spread with the event is that there are several programs being offered to property owners through the FireSmart program.</p><p>Home assessments are available for free, which see a FireSmart coordinator visit and tour your property to provide tips and suggestions on what can be improved, a rebate of up to 50 per cent or $500 for landscaping or home improvements which make the property safer is also available. Reflective address signs to make a property easier for firefighters to find at night are also available for $25, among other resources and programs.</p><p>For more information on Metchosin's FireSmart program, visit metchosinfire.ca or check out the Metchosin FireSmart Facebook page.</p><p>READ MORE: FireSmart home assessments a timely resource for Metchosin</p><p>@JSamanski</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:justin.samanski-langille@goldstreamgazette.com\">justin.samanski-langille@goldstreamgazette.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Goldstream News Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLDNWS-news20220618PGO4335978</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLDNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65R2-PWP1-JD2C-J05F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438289</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

(CSE:RFR) (OTC:RFHRF) (FSE:9RR) (\"Renforth\" or the \"Company\") would like to update shareholders on results from the Company's March/April 2023 drilling on our ~20km Victoria mineralized structure at Surimeau. The main finding of this drill program is an increase in the frequency and thickness of mineralized graphitic mudstone layers, like the mineralization seen in the very first holes drilled at Surimeau, approximately 6km to the east. The mineralized graphitic mudstone is also exposed on surface, south of the previously drilled 2.2 km of Victoria strike. Victoria's geological setting includes graphitic shale, mafic and ultramafic rock, a setting similar to the Outokumpu district in eastern Finland.</p><p>Outokumpu District encompassed 3 major deposits mined between 1913-88, resulting in production of ~50Mt of ore consisting of 2.8 wt.% Cu, 1 wt.% Zn, 0.2 wt.% Co and minor amounts of Ni and Au</p><p>Terrafame's low carbon Talvivaara Mine, located just north of the Outokumpu District, boasts reserves of 1 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.22% nickel, 0.13% copper, 0.5% zinc and 0.02% cobalt containing 2.2 million tonnes of nickel, 1.3 million tonnes of copper, 5 million tonnes of zinc and 0.2 million tonnes of cobalt.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/ff2ebc65a28df9ae1d5af96880c6c7ad.pngClick\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/ff2ebc65a28df9ae1d5af96880c6c7ad.pngClick</url> Image To View Full Size</p><p>Importance of Mineralized Graphitic Mudstones</p><p>Zinc-rich graphitic mudstones are notable at Surimeau, and are a characteristic of a VMS environment, some of which may host economic VMS mineralization. At Surimeau, graphitic mudstone is in direct structural contact with the surrounding ultramafic bodies. Alteration of the ultramafics to calc-silicates along this contact is at times significant with widths of up to several meters. The calc-silicate-rich rock adjacent to the graphitic mudstones often host Zn and Ni occurring as a significantly wider mineralized horizon in localized zones along strike. These wider mineralized areas are priority targets for ongoing exploration at Surimeau. Renforth looks to two specific examples of similar mineralization as models to guide our interpretation and exploration planning at Surimeau, as follows:</p><p>1) \"Outokumpu Model\" as designated by our technical advisor, Dr. James Franklin FRSC P. Geo, based upon our initial 2020 drilling, which intersected significant mineralized graphitic mudstone in 2 of the 3 holes drilled, and our follow-up 2021 drilling. The results of the most recent drilling support this model. Outokumpu is notable as it is a unique mining district in eastern Finland, where various mines have operated since 1913, with the deposits being polygenetic, formed by structural juxtaposition of two types of mineralization, magmatic NI-Cu-PGM and stratabound, syngenetic Zn-Cu VMS types. Additionally, in the Outokumpu mines, black graphitic schist hosts the deposits.</p><p>2) Talvivaara Mine, Finland, currently in operation north of the arctic circle, is also in eastern Finland, north of the Outokumpu district. Talvivaara does not currently appear to be a direct analogue to Surimeau, which has characteristics of both Outokumpu and Talvivaara -settings. Taken from \"The Talvivaara Black Shale Hosted Ni-Zn-Cu-Co Deposit in Eastern Finland\" published by Mineral Deposits of Finland in 2015, the following summarizes the importance of black shales (mudstones, shales, siltstones) and the difficulty differentiating Outokumpu from Talvivaara settings. \"Because of their often-large extent, ancient black shale strata represent one of the most significant crustal reservoirs of organic carbon and sulfur, and potential resources of many metals, including so-called critical metals. In some cases, the metal concentrations of black shales can reach sufficiently high levels, generating an ore deposit. Characteristically, these deposits are polymetallic, such as the Paleoproterozoic Talvivaara Ni-Zn-Cu-Co deposit in Finland...a clear distinction between black shale-hosted deposits and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag-Au, sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) Pb-Zn-Ag, or sediment-hosted epigenetic (Kupferschiefer, Katanga) Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag deposits cannot always be drawn, as the host rocks of these deposits may contain black shales influenced by migrating hydrothermal fluids (Coveney, 2003).\"#ftn1 Renforth looks to Talvivaara in part because it may eventually be a relevant model, but more so because the operation of the mine and mineral processing is of inspiration. Talvivaara operates as a heap leach mine, with production from two small open pits, that produces battery chemicals (nickel and cobalt sulphates) as the primary products. Terrafame, the operating company, puts the environment first in their mine, stating \"The main factor behind the small carbon footprint is our bioleaching method, which consumes considerably less energy than conventional methods. The ore does not need to be crushed nor grinded as fine as in the traditional process, and high temperature metallurgical processes are not used in further processing\"#ftn2. Renforth looks to this operation as inspiration for Surimeau's future and an example of how mining can be done better. Of course, at this time Surimeau is not a mine, a deposit nor does it have proven economic value; however, the aforementioned deposit-type examples (Outokumpu and the possibly related Talvivaara deposit) provide models for our ongoing efforts to achieve this goal.</p><p>Currently, Renforth is proceeding with several desktop-based exercises for Surimeau as we are now not able to be active in the field as planned due to forest-fire conditions. Our previously announced (see press release May 31, 2023) pegmatite focused field operations are expected to commence mid-July, south of the Victoria mineralized structure. In addition to this we have completed additional targeting which will be the subject of a separate press release. Our current database has been updated and access granted to Dr. Franklin in order for him to update our VMS exploration efforts. In addition to this Renforth has commenced modelling the central Victoria area, where we have completed the most work, in order to determine whether an initial resource can be calculated over this limited area. Our various efforts are ongoing and will now incorporate the mineralized graphitic mudstone as an exploration target, along with the mineralized ultramafic and shear zone settings.</p><p>Technical disclosure in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Francis R.

Offering exposure to gold, zinc, nickel, copper, cobalt and more, including lithium, Renforth's land position encompasses several areas of interest. In the more than 300 square kilometres Renforth holds, there are both resources and mineralized ground undergoing exploration to extend zones and define the amount of metal in structures.</p><p>Renforth's position is unique in that the ground is road accessible, has hydro power in place and is in an established and secure mining jurisdiction which regularly ranks as Top 10 (as determined by the Fraser Institute) in the world.</p><p>The CLLF, which extends from west of Kirkland Lake in Ontario to east of Val d'Or in Quebec is a regional first order fault which hosts numerous mines along its extent, including one of Canada's most lucrative gold mines, the know historic O'Brien Mine which formed the Cadillac Mining Camp, and Renforth's Parbec gold deposit near Malartic. Now, immediately north of Renforth's landholdings is one of the few instances of the CLLF being mined on its north side with North America's deepest single stage shaft, the Penna shaft, at Agnico Eagle's LaRonde Mine. Renforth holds the dominant land position in the Cadillac Camp south of the fault, and a good portion of the land position in the Malartic camp as well, contiguous to one of the few mines operating on the south side of the Cadillac Break, the Canadian Malartic Mine. Renforth's landholdings in the area host gold and silver as well as a host of future facing, or battery, metals such as nickel, copper, zinc, cobalt, and lithium.</p><p>No securities regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the contents of this news release.</p><p>Forward Looking Statements</p><p>This news release contains forward-looking statements and information under applicable securities laws.

Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy is partnering with the district of Vanderhoof to deploy a group of air quality sensors around the community to identify air quality 'hotspots' and 'coldspots.'</p><p>Ben Weinstein and Vickie Irish, air quality meteorologists with the ministry were in Vanderhoof on Monday (April 25) to install the sensors.</p><p>Currently air quality measurements are taken at the courthouse in downtown Vanderhoof. The new sensors will cover a wider area including one at the Airport.</p><p>Weinstein said Vanderhoof is similar to other communities in northern B.C. looking for ways to deal with a mix of pollutants that hurt air quality. \"The ministry of environment is implementing these kinds of programs in communities that need it,\" Weinstein said.</p><p>He said Vanderhoof is a \"red-zone community\" from the perspective of the Canadian ambient air quality standards for particulate matter harmful to human health.</p><p>The Purple Air small citizen science air quality sensors measure extremely small particles (under 2.5 micrometers) in the air caused mostly from combustion sources that go deep into your lungs when you breathe. There will be 14 sensors in the Vanderhoof network.</p><p>\"The ministry of environment has done this in a number of communities including recently in Smithers. That was a network I worked on developing. Based on the success of that I felt good about rolling it out to other communities across northern B.C., Highway 16,\" Weinstein said.</p><p>\"The idea is to gain information and then use that to target actions on improving air quality in the areas where we need to.\"</p><p>He said the Smithers sensors are already bringing home a wealth of data that the municipality can use to address air quality.</p><p>\"We're seeing areas that have higher levels of particulate matter and areas that don't and that's the intent of the network. It's very informative. You can go in real time and particulate matter levels within the community and you can identify little sources,\" Weinstein said.</p><p>\"Sometimes they are residential wood stoves, sometimes it's industrial sources and sometimes when there's a forest fire you can see everything light up at the same time.</p><p>\"Vanderhoof is like many communities that struggle with how to deal with, find solutions and come to terms with the different kinds of sources they have.\"</p><p>Sensors will also be installed to measure air quality around Houston and surrounding areas.</p><p>READ MORE: Vanderhoof wood pellet plant to double emissions with new expansion</p><p>READ MORE: Southern B.C.

Duthie based the installation on the global temperature map from June 29, 2021, the date when Canada surpassed all temperature records by hitting 49.6 degrees Celsius in Lytton, B.C. As many will remember, Lytton burnt to the ground as a result of a forest fire the very day after setting the record.</p><p>Duthie, who has been working in textile arts her entire adult life, may represent the Platonic ideal for artists in that she boasts a rigorous intellect and strong conceptual basis, which is met by her equally strong execution and artistry. She often uses texture and layers as metaphors to create a narrative with her pieces, whether they are architectural garments or abstract wall pieces.</p><p>When first installed last Friday, the layout of the Chromatic Navigation tiles precisely followed B.C's temperature mapping in waves of orange and red with cooler zones of purple, blue and green at the outer edges. As Duthie noted, using the weather map \"was the perfect avenue for working with so much colour, but also for telling a story.\"</p><p>While the collection as a whole is impressive, each tile is also a unique artwork on its own. Duthie has incorporated material from the Lytton disaster into the artwork:many of the tiles are embellished by a strip of charred wood she collected from trees in the area and treated with sumi ink she made from the charcoal. Other embellishments include small pieces of ceramic \u2014 which have undergone a firing process of their own.</p><p>Despite the deep engagement with such an overwhelming topic as climate emergency, however, the installation is ultimately positive in nature and actually fun. Viewers are encouraged to move the individual tiles around to transform the overall pattern, a process that is happening throughout the exhibition month.</p><p>\"The viewers become the vehicle of change, altering the visual pathways to set a different course of navigation,\"Duthie explained, adding this process will hopefully open ways of thinking about the small things we can do in the \"real world\"and how these small steps can in fact lead to impactful change.</p><p>Visitors to Artcraft may find Duthie in attendance at the gallery in the coming weeks, as she hopes to encourage people to engage with the interactive work and to document how the installation changes overtime.</p><p>The show continues daily at Mahon Hall through July 4. Artcraft is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p><p>ARTCRAFT MANAGER</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20220615PGWA0002755717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:677F-XV51-JD2C-J0MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Over the past 20 years, there\u2019s been less and less snow every summer, sometimes disappearing by the end of spring.</p><p>It\u2019s a personal marker of climate change for me.</p><p>Of course, this year, the snow held on a lot longer than has been usual of late.</p><p>By this time last year, we had already been through months of above-average temperatures, and were hammered with the heat dome that would kill hundreds of people. I recall stepping out of the office onto the parking lot and feeling the heat on the surface of my eyeballs.</p><p>This year, we got the opposite. Instead of heat, we\u2019ve got below-average temps. Instead of crops literally cooking on the vine, we\u2019re worried it\u2019s too cold and damp for much to grow.</p><p>A powerful La Nina system is dumping cool and wet weather on us.</p><p>But this is closer to \u201cnormal\u201d weather for the coast than what we\u2019ve experienced for the last 20 years.</p><p>Go back to the late 19th and early 20th century, and things really were cooler. According to provincial data, B.C. is up about 1.4\u00b0C per century since 1900. Winters in particular are milder, rising 2.2\u00b0C on average, with variations across the province.</p><p>Meanwhile, the region that includes the Lower Mainland has seen a 14 per cent increase in precipitation.</p><p>That data is a few years old. After the roller-coaster of the past two years, with its record-breaking heat, cold, and rain coming on each other\u2019s heels, they might have to update the charts a bit.</p><p>We\u2019re seeing more extremes in B.C. , it seems. When it\u2019s dry and hot, it\u2019s going to set off forest fires and heat alerts, when it\u2019s cold and wet, it\u2019s going to soak and chill us even more.</p><p>Yet I can\u2019t help but notice that the weather this year isn\u2019t all bad.</p><p>Not great for a lot of berry crops, sure, awful for orchards, probably pretty crummy for potatoes.</p><p>But mild temperatures and plenty of rain are pretty good for a lot of native plants. The weather we\u2019ve had this year is closer to the what was normal for this area before humans started burning coal and oil on a massive scale a century and a half ago.</p><p>But there is no normal anymore.</p><p>This year might be followed by one that\u2019s hot and dry. Or cool and dry, or hot with sudden storms. Maybe we\u2019ll get a typhoon next, or another tornado like the waterspout last year that touched down just off of UBC.</p><p>If we knew what was normal, we might be able to better plan for the future, for our forest fire prevention needs, for agriculture, for flood prevention and disaster response.</p><p>But we broke normal. Climate change isn\u2019t some abstract thing that\u2019s going to happen in the future, it\u2019s here now.</p><p>The weather we grew up with wasn\u2019t quite normal. Our future weather will be even less so.</p><p>Matthew Claxton is a reporter with the Langley Advance Times, sister paper to the Peace Arch News.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PEANWS-news20220707PRPA0002819018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PEANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65W6-88W1-JD2C-J3SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

It doesn't dance around what's at stake with the environmental emergencies we face.</p><p>COP26 will take place in Glasgow next month, and still, after 26 years of these climate-change related meetings, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.</p><p>It is audacious that anyone expects us to give up a liveable future for the sake of corporate profits. Let's figure out how to change course together.</p><p>How can we stop blaming each other and unite for a better future despite our difference? We can't let our occupation, political beliefs, age, identity, opinions or anything else divide us.</p><p>We need to do address this existential threat together.</p><p>I believe the best place to start is where we live. It's where we fully grasp the issues, know the players and have responsibility as citizens. In B.C., here are some places we could start: Support land defenders and honour the spirit of UNDRIP; stop clearcutting old growth and adopt regenerative forestry; stop fracking and pipelines, and invest in clean energy and a just transition instead; get fish farms out of our waters and restore salmon that so many depend upon; cancel Site C and restore the wildlife habitat and agricultural land in the region.</p><p>Doing these things would solve many problems and set an example for other jurisdictions.</p><p>Living lightly doesn't reduce emissions much, but demonstrates what life can be like in a healed world.</p><p>The future is non-negotiable.

The alert could be escalated to an evacuation order if the fire directly threatens residents and visitors.</p><p>The alert includes a five-kilometre radius around Stewart Crossing, 12 kilometres southeast to Ethel Lake Road and east to include residences around Ethel Lake.</p><p>People living and visiting in the affected area must be ready to leave within two hours of being notified.</p><p>Local residents and visitors are being asked to avoid visiting properties in the affected area and to proactively relocate before the fire becomes a direct problem.</p><p>A wildfire over the weekend has also prompted an emergency evacuation ordered July 2 at 6 p.m. for the Ethel Lake campground and surrounding area. An online update indicates Wildland Fire crews had been working with RCMP, department of Energy, Mines and Resources staff and volunteer firefighters to advise people and coordinate the evacuation.</p><p>Multiple highways closed</p><p>Yukon 511 has alerted the public about fires forcing road closures including the Klondike Highway, Robert Campbell Highway, Nahanni Range Road and McQuesten Road.</p><p>In an online update July 3, fire information officer Haley Ritchie of Wildland Fire said thick, intense smoke from the Crystal Creek fire, which is more than 1,500 hectares, is making the Klondike Highway impassable from Pelly Crossing to Stewart Crossing.</p><p>In Wildland Fire's latest online update, the Klondike Highway remains closed as of 11 a.m. on July 4. A solution is being worked on to let limited movement of vehicles with assistance of pilot cars. No timeline for reopening is available, although the closure is temporary.</p><p>Protective Services has also posted several updates to social media and its website.</p><p>A forest fire on Highway 4 has shut down the road from kilometre zero to the 354 mark, according to Protective Services.</p><p>Nahanni Range Road north of Watson Lake has been closed due to a fire burning around kilometre 76 to 78. In a tweet, Protective Services said the Northern Tungsten mine is located far from the fire and is not being threatened.</p><p>A July 3 report on wildfires states the Yukon has been hit with 6,000 lightning strikes a day. More lightning-caused fires are expected in the area on July 4, according to the report.</p><p>As of the latest July 4 report, 93 active fires had been burning in the territory, with 21 new fires in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Wildland Fire said July 4 there are a number of concerning fires burning in the Silver Trail area, including around Mayo and Keno City.</p><p>Crews are working on the Frances lake fire, which has grown to 1,500 hectares.</p><p>The Snag Creek fire burning approximately 15 kilometres north of Beaver Creek is 900 hectares and Wildland Fire is setting up advanced sprinkler systems as a precaution to protect the community.</p><p>The 240-hectare Rancheria Mountain fire is burning six kilometres south of the Alaska Highway but is not currently moving towards the road.</p><p>A level two fire ban remains in place across the Yukon.</p><p>READ MORE: Yukon brings in burning ban</p><p>Contact Dana Hatherly at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com\">dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2022 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20220704IYN4342637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65VG-85H1-JD2C-J08X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Emergency Health Services have moved ahead with an expansion of personnel and services, including hiring 65 dispatchers, 20 of whom have completed training. The remaining dispatchers are expected to begin work starting in January 2022.</p><p>B.C.'s ambulance service and dispatchers have been struggling to keep up with calls in the past year, with drug overdoses, forest fire and extreme weather events and an increase in calls from people who avoided seeking medical care in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>RELATED: Parents drive child to hospital after long ambulance wait</p><p>RELATED: Dispatchers putting 9-1-1 callers on hold as calls surge</p><p>There are 22 additional ambulances being prepared for service, with nine of them already operational, Dix said.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, July 27, 2023, 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: JUNE, 5, 2023) Atwater Avenue between Cawthra Road and Alexandra Avenue in Ward 1<br/><br/> Cherry Post Drive, between Camilla Road and Corsair Road in Ward 7.

The Esperanza Gold Project is located within the Tetlama community and forming this strategic alliance establishing Tetlama's support to advance the development of this project is an incredibly important milestone.\"</p><p>Previously,the Company's subsidiary, Esperanza Silver de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and the Tetlama Community entered into a temporary occupancy agreement, which formed the basis for a strong relationship between the parties. The Company is focused on creating economic opportunity for all stakeholders within the local community while operating in accordance with best practices related to ESG standards.</p><p>The different projects of these three axes of community relations previously undertaken include a medical support program; scholarship programs for middle and high school students; backyard garden program; support in the conditioning and repair of infrastructure of drinking water supply facilities; visual and dental health campaigns; support for the community forest fire fighting brigade; training and development program for community entrepreneurs; support for community celebrations and cultural events; support for improvement of school infrastructure. During the hardest stage of COVID, the community was supported with sanitary material and equipment and food pantries.</p><p>As the Esperanza Gold Project continues to move forward within Tetlama (where 100% of the deposit and key infrastructure is located), the Company will broaden its social and community programs to include other communities in the region that are located outside of the Esperanza Gold Project.</p><p> Qualified Person</p><p>The contents of this news release have been reviewed and approved by Chris Wilson, B.Sc.

I feel we are being treated like sheep and are being forced down one particular path.</p><p>I don't like the process. I don't think it is the Salt Spring way to hire a PR firm (paid for by our tax dollars) to tout the building of any project. The project should speak for itself and I am skeptical when a project hires a PR firm to tout its justification.</p><p>Also I don't like how we have been over-taxed $0.6 million per year, resulting in a $3-million \"slush fund.\"Despite the \"no increase in taxes\"spin, we are deciding how to spend $0.6 million per year of our precious tax dollars for the next 15 years or more. The only option being presented is a new fire hall. This will be the most costly public structure on the island. Will this new fire hall make our island more fire-safe? Is this proposal addressing the most pressing need here in our island community? I don't think a $13.7-million fire hall will improve fire service or fix any of the limitations of our fire protection. Expensive fire truck housing will not add to our fire safety.</p><p>Since insufficient water is one limitation, perhaps investing in creating lake and salt-water access points around the island with pumps and tankers capable of utilizing both fresh and salt-water for fighting structure or forest fires is more important than a new building two times more expensive than the last proposal. I'm particularly concerned about the potential for a large forest fire. Given our limited ferry capacity, we may not all easily escape the island if such a catastrophe were to occur.</p><p>Another important consideration is decreasing response time. Will spending $13.7 million to relocate fire trucks to the new site reduce the response time if your house was on fire? The fire department should have a general idea of the response time for every structure on Salt Spring. What is the time between notification of a fire and the fire department sprinkling 1,000 gallons of water onto your structure?

I recall stepping out of the office onto the parking lot and feeling the heat on the surface of my eyeballs.</p><p>This year, we got the opposite. Instead of heat, we\u2019ve got below-average temps.

(QNI or the Company) is pleased to report drill assay results from the Ducros Sill target at its Ducros Ni-Co-Cu-PGE project, located 85 kilometers northeast of Val-dOr, Qubec.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights: //st * Hole QDG-23-503 was terminated at 450 metres depth in nickel + cobalt-bearing dunite, the last 118.30 metres of which returned 0.21% Ni + 117 ppm Co; * Hole QDG-23-505 returned 293 metres at 0.19% Ni + 106 ppm Co, including a higher-grade subinterval of 152 metres @ 0.21% Ni + 114 ppm Co; * Confirmation that the Ducros Sill is mineralized with nickel and cobalt across its entire ~300 metre width; the geophysical expression of the ultramafic body extends for seven kilometers along strike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ducros Sill Target</p><p>The Ducros Sill target lies at the southern half of the two-kilometer wide by fifteen-kilometer long Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex (DUSC), in the south-central portion of QNIs Ducros claims (Figure 1). Historically, four widely spaced holes were drilled in the immediate area by Abitibi Resources Ltd. (Abitibi) in 1987 (Figure 3, 4). Assessment report drill logs for the Abitibi holes describe variably serpentinized and magnetic dunitic +/- pyroxenitic rocks with occurrences of trace amounts of native copper and brucite throughout their entire drilled lengths (Quebec Government report GM 47268). Notable results include hole 87-6 which returned greater than 0.22% nickel and 120 ppm cobalt over the last 20 metres of the 106.7 metre long BQ diameter hole.</p><p>As previously announced, the Company completed a series of holes this winter along an east-west fence approximately 100 metres north of the historical Abitibi hole 87-06 (see April 19,2023 news release). The fence of holes was designed to cut across the entire 600-metre-wide magnetic high feature (Figure 2, 3). In addition to drilling this fence of holes, the Company also completed a hole approximately one kilometer north of the drill fence to test the continuity of the Ducros Sill magnetic high anomaly, hole QDG-23-506, at the very end of the winter exploration program (Figure 2, 3). All four holes completed at Ducros Sill by the Company this winter intersected long core lengths of serpentinized ultramafic rocks, including dunite, peridotite and pyroxenite units (see April 19, 2023 News Release for additional information).</p><p>Current Drilling Results</p><p>Hole QDG-23-503 was collared on the west side of the targeted magnetic high and was drilled eastward at a dip of -45, towards the centre of the ultramafic intrusion (Figure 2). The hole encountered a package of intercalated mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks, including gabbro, pyroxenite, peridotite and dunite, from 23.00 to 308.00 metres downhole depth before cutting a 142-metre-long interval of serpentinized dunite, believed to be the same unit encountered in Abitibi hole 87-6. The hole was terminated in this lower dunite unit until the planned end of hole of 450 metres depth. Assay results returned 0.19% Ni + 111 ppm Co over the last 217 metres of the hole (233.00-450.00 m depth) including a higher-grade subinterval of 118.30 metres @ 0.21% Ni + 117 ppm Co (308.20-426.50 m depth).</p><p>Hole QDG-23-505 was collared approximately 210 metres east of QDG-23-503 and drilled towards the east at a -45 dip to the planned end of hole depth of 402 metres (Figure 2, 3). The hole collared in variably serpentinized dunite at 21.00 metres hole depth and remained in the altered ultramafic unit until 314.00 metres, a 293-metre-long intersection, where it encountered metasedimentary footwall rocks.</p><p>Assay results for this hole returned a 293-metre-long intersection of 0.19% Ni + 106 ppm Co (21.00- 314.00 m) including a higher-grade subinterval of 0.21% Ni + 114 ppm Co over 152 metres (79.50-231.50 m).</p><p>Hole QDG-23-504 was collared approximately 210 metres east of QDG-23-505 and was also drilled towards the east at a -45 dip to a depth of 243 metres (Figure 2, 3). This hole collared in variably serpentinized dunite until 117.00 metres downhole, after which it entered the package of metasedimentary footwall rocks.</p><p>Assay results from this hole returned 109.50 metres @ 0.16% Ni + 90 ppm Co (21.00-130.50 m) including a higher-grade subinterval of 0.20% Ni + 105 ppm Co over 29 metres near surface (21.00-50.00 m hole depth).</p><p>A drill section summarizing the results from these three holes can be found as Figure 2. A summary of the assay results is found in Table 1.</p><p>Hole QDG-23-506 was collared approximately one kilometer north of the three-hole fence noted above to test the interpreted strike extension of the Ducros Sill ultramafic intrusion. This interpretation is based on the continuity of the airborne magnetic high feature identified by the 2022 VTEM survey as well as the lone historical hole completed by Abitibi in the immediate area (hole 87-1, Figure 3). After passing through overburden, hole QDG-23-506 collared in variably serpentinized dunite at 30.00 metres hole depth and finished in the same dunite unit at 366.00 metres. The hole was terminated earlier than planned due to the onset of spring breakup. Assays are pending for this hole, but the results are expected to be in line with those returned from QDG-23-503 through QDG-23-505.</p><p>Given these results, this part of the Ducros Sill where hole QDG-23-506 was completed is now referred to as Ducros Sill North whereas the area which includes the recently completed three-hole drill fence is referred to as Ducros Sill South as shown in Figures 3 and 4. //st Hole ID From (m) To (m) Length (m) Ni (%) Co (ppm) QDG-23-503 233.00 450.00 217.00 0.19 111 including 308.20 426.50 118.30 0.21 117 QDG-23-504 21.00 130.50 109.50 0.16 90 including 21.00 50.00 29.00 0.20 105 QDG-23-505 21.00 314.00 293.00 0.19 106 including 79.50 231.50 152.00 0.21 114 QDG-23-506 Assays pending</p><p>Table 1. Summary of assay results for holes QDG-23-503 through QDG-23-505. Reported results are sample length weighted.</p><p>Extents of the Ducros Sill Intrusion</p><p>The digital Qubec government geology for QNIs Ducros Project claims, as sourced from the SIGEOM database, combined with these recent results indicates the Ducros Sill ultramafic intrusion now spans two kilometres north of QNIs most recent drilling, as confirmed by hole QDG-23-506, to approximately five kilometers to the south-southeast (Figure 1, 4). There is no evidence of this magnetic high feature being exposed at surface or drilled beyond the recent work conducted by QNI and Abitibi Resources Ltd. in 1987. Should this seven-kilometer-long magnetic anomaly be the geophysical expression of the Ducros Sill intrusion, as is currently hypothesized, its overall dimensions would rival the size of other high-profile large tonnage nickel-cobalt projects currently being advanced in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt.</p><p>Fortin Sill Zone Work Update</p><p>During the first part of the year, exploration drilling focused exclusively on testing targets that require winter conditions to access, such as at the Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex and Ducros Gabbro targets (Figure 1). The Company intends to resume exploration at the Fortin Sill Zone, where local ground conditions allow for year-round access, once the forest fire-related work restrictions are lifted. Drilling at the Fortin Sill Zone this summer and fall will follow up on some of the exceptional results returned in 2022, including from hole QDG-22-29, which drilled an 11.80 metre interval containing 1.44% Ni, 1.49% Cu, 461 ppm Co and 2.79 g/t Pt-Pd-Au that includes a higher-grade subinterval assaying 1.85% Ni, 1.65% Cu (3.50% Ni + Cu), 576 ppm Co and 3.27 g/t Pt-Pd-Au over 8.43 metres (see August 30, 2022 News Release for reference).</p><p>Core Processing &amp;QAQC</p><p>Qubec Nickel has implemented a quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) program for its drilling programs to ensure best practices for logging, sampling and analysis of its drill core as well as for the collection and analyses of rock samples. This includes the regular insertion of geochemical blanks, sample duplicates and multiple Ni-Cu-PGE-Au certified reference material standards (CRMs) into the sample stream.</p><p>Drill core is collected by Ducros Project personnel daily from the drill rigs and transported in secured core boxes to QNIs core logging facilities in Lebel-sur-Quvillon. Logging is completed on laptops and data are captured using fit-for-purpose computer software.</p><p>Core destined for geochemical analyses is identified and labeled by core logging geologists and is then sawed in half by a diamond blade. One half of the NQ-diameter core sample is placed in a labeled and secured sample bag. The remaining half of the core sample is returned to its core box for archiving. All core samples are transported from QNIs logging facilities to AGAT Laboratories and/or SGS Canadas sample preparation facilities in Val-dOr in secured and numbered rice bags by Project personnel.</p><p>AGAT Laboratories and SGS operate under a Quality Management System that complies with the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard. Analysis for precious metals (gold, platinum, and palladium) is completed by Fire Assay with an ICP-OES finish while analyses for nickel, copper and 41 other elements are performed using AGATs and SGSs 4 Acid Digest Metals Packages, with an ICP-OES finish.</p><p>QUALIFIED PERSON</p><p>Gary DeSchutter, M.Sc., P.Geo., Vice-President of Exploration for Qubec Nickel Corp., and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined under National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), has reviewed, and approved the scientific and technical content of this press release.</p><p>ABOUT QUEBEC NICKEL CORP.</p><p>Qubec Nickel Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on acquiring, exploring, and developing critical metals (Ni-Cu-Co-PGE) projects in Qubec, Canada.

The two principals did not know each other well, Democrats repeatedly insisted on not negotiating on the nation\u2019s borrowing obligations while Republicans demanded spending cuts that the White House did not want.

JOHN'S, NL, Nov. 24, 2023 /CNW/ -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I. Building a more prosperous, secure, and sustainable future</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. We, the leaders of Canada and the European Union (EU), met today in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador to reaffirm our strategic partnership, advance our cooperation to seize the opportunities of our time and respond to pressing challenges. In a more complex, competitive and unpredictable world, working together to promote our shared values of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the rules based international order and to pursue our common interests is more important than ever. We stand firmly together in the pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity in the world including in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p><p>2. Our steadily deepening partnership makes us stronger and more resilient, delivering clear benefits to our people by generating sustainable economic growth and creating jobs. Cooperation between Canada and the European Union can help make life more affordable and create good jobs   on both sides of the Atlantic. Our common values and principles are why we are positioned to grow circular, nature positive and climate-neutral economies across Canada and Europe that are competitive, inclusive and provide equal opportunities for all, and why we are able to work together to fight the triple crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to protect people from its worst impacts. We are putting people first as we do this   making sure households are better off as we build a prosperous climate neutral economy.</p><p>3. We emphasize the fundamental role that the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA)and the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) have played in strengthening our relationship in the seven years since they were signed. We remain strongly committed to ensuring their full and effective implementation and their ratification, and commit to further expanding our cooperation under these agreements.</p><p>4. Today we are pleased to announce significant new areas of cooperation. The establishment of a Green Alliance will deepen our already close cooperation on climate action and shared work to grow sustainable, competitive economies with good jobs. A Digital Partnership will strengthen our engagement on digital transformation and governance in a rapidly changing world. Substantive negotiations of an agreement on Canada's participation inthe EU's Horizon Europe programme are now completed, and both sides are working towards its prompt signature and implementation. The agreement will further strengthen the cooperation of our science communities in addressing global challenges.</p><p> II. Global Priorities</p><p>5. Our support to Ukraine is steadfast. We share an unequivocal condemnation of Russia's ongoing war of aggression and our unwavering commitment to Ukraine including a just and sustainable peace based on international law, Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. We will continue our intensified diplomatic outreach efforts and cooperation with Ukraine and other countries to ensure the widest possible international support for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace and the key principles and objectives of Ukraine's Peace Formula, with a view to a Global Peace Summit being held. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, will work to address Ukraine's immediate military and defence needs and ensure Ukraine has the long-term security commitments needed, while it pursues its Euro-Atlantic integration. We will do so in full respect of the security and defence policy of certain EU Member States and taking into account the security and defence interests of all EU Member States, the EU and Canada. We will work together to support Ukraine's sustainable security, and will continue providing military, humanitarian, economic and financial support, and facilitate trade, private investment, and will prioritize recovery and reconstruction. We welcome the informal coordination between Canada and the EU's training missions, Operations UNIFIER and EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), conducting critical training of the Ukrainian military. Canada and the EU alongside other G7 Members, will continue to work through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform on ensuring a robust response to Ukraine's reconstruction needs. To further strengthen this collaboration, Canada intends to deploy a secondee to the Platform's Secretariat in the near future. We acknowledge Ukraine's commitment and substantial efforts to meet the required conditions in its EU accession process. We encourage Ukraine to continue on its path of reforms. We will continue to work together to support Ukraine's security, defence and resilience on one hand, and reconstruction and reforms on the other, thus creating conditions to mobilise private investment. The EU and Canada will continue cooperating to deliver concrete solutions in support of Ukraine's agriculture and agri-food sector which could include facilitating exports of grain and agricultural products from Ukraine to third countries including those most in need. We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and in reform efforts on its European path.</p><p>6. Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine. We are united in our determination to ensure full accountability. The EU and Canada call for work to continue, including in the Core Group, on efforts to establish a tribunal for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine that would enjoy the broadest cross-regional support and legitimacy, and towards the establishment of a future compensation mechanism. Canada and the EU recognise that decisive progress is needed, in coordination with partners, on how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction, consistent with applicable contractual obligations, and in accordance with EU and international law.</p><p>7. We recognize the value and the growing importance of our cooperation on restrictive measures. In particular, we will continue to impose extensive sanctions targeting Russia, as well as stringent export control restrictions and prohibitions. Moreover, we are committed to further strengthening our cooperation and coordination on broader sanctions actions, including disrupting circumvention, in support of our policy objectives.</p><p>8. We unequivocally condemn Hamas for its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel on October 7. We support Israel's right to defend itself, in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and welcome the recent agreement to liberate hostages and to allow for an extended humanitarian pause to permit the delivery of essential supplies. We underscore that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations.</p><p>9. We are gravely concerned about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and welcome the adoption of resolution 2712 by the United Nations (UN) Security Council, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip. We reaffirm the imperative to protect civilians and ensure full compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law. We strongly reiterate the importance of urgent and unimpeded access for life saving humanitarian aid flowing to Gaza through all necessary measures, including humanitarian corridors and pauses. We have contributed significant funding for humanitarian assistance and remain committed to addressing urgent humanitarian needs.</p><p>10.We remain committed to the goal of comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East, and re-iterate our belief in the renewed importance of progress towards a two-state solutionon the basis of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions through reinvigorated efforts in the peace process. We stand ready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the two-state solution, with the State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous, sovereign, and viable Palestinian State, living side-by-side in peace and security and mutual recognition. We remain opposed to any forced displacement of Palestinians. We condemn all forms of intolerance and discrimination, on the basis of religion, belief or origin and remain firmly committed to combatting all forms of hatred.</p><p>11.We express deep concerns with Iran's nuclear escalation and its refusal to meaningfully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and its persistent failure to implement Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) commitments. We wholly support the IAEA's mission of continued verification and monitoring in Iran. A diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue remains the best way to address international concerns. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon.</p><p>12. We are prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, including through cooperation on global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, debt sustainability, global health and pandemic preparedness. China is an important trade and economic partner and we will seek to ensure a level playing field and a balanced, reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship. We will continue to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in its supply chains, and will de-risk and diversify where necessary and appropriate. We do not intend to decouple or to turn inwards. The East and South China Seas are of strategic importance for regional and global prosperity and security. We remain seriously concerned about growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in Canada's or the European Union's One China policy. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang.With respect to Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.</p><p>13. We recognize the critical challenges faced by our countries and by our global partners, from climate impacts and food insecurity to ensuring a just transition, good governance, rule of law, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will work together with partners from around the world to address these challenges, including in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. In the Pacific Islands, we will reinforce our support, including to advance their priorities in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms. We agree on the importance of a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic.</p><p>14. We reaffirm our commitment to coordinate our actions in the Sahel region, alongside international and regional organizations. We support L'Acad\u00e9mie Internationale de Lutte Contre le Terrorisme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in responding to evolving terrorist threats and violent extremism. We will work together in supporting the people of Haiti in their efforts to build a more resilient and equitable future, including by fighting impunity and corruption, restoring security and stability and creating the necessary conditions for holding democratic elections.</p><p> III. Sustainable economic growth for all</p><p>15.The Canada-EU economic relationship, underpinned by CETA, has contributed to delivering prosperity for our economies during a period of global uncertainty. Now in the seventh yearof provisional application, CETA's benefits to workers, exporters and our economies are clear: in 2022, bilateral trade in goods was significantly higher than pre-CETA levels in 2016.Through a single set of high standard rules, businesses and workers in Canada and the EU are benefitting from a more predictable, transparent and accessible business environment. Canada and the EU will continue to use the mechanisms established by CETA to cooperate towards building resilient and diversified supply chains. We will continue work to ensure the full implementation of CETA, and to sustainably strengthen Canada-EU trade, including for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs. Canada and the EU acknowledge the important role CETA can play in driving sustainable development and moving towards a climate neutral economy. We welcome related investments and will work together for transparency and against zero-sum competition in our path toward climate neutrality.</p><p>16.Canada and the EU intend to focus on the negotiations toward a renewed competition cooperation agreement that would drive deeper cooperation and coordination possibilities between our respective competition agencies, providing a legal framework to coordinate enforcement activities and share information obtained through investigative powers in full respect of data privacy guarantees.</p><p>17.Canada is well-positioned to contribute to Europe's energy security and energy transition. The Canada-EU High Level Energy Dialogue will continue facilitating action on all energy-related matters, including proceeding with the EU becoming a member of the Equal by 30 Campaign, led by Canada, which is working towards equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women in the energy sector by 2030 and launching a new European Commission   Canada Roadmap on Methane Emissions. We are laying the foundation for reliable hydrogen supply chains and common approaches to standards and certification, which will accelerate commercialization and increase transatlantic trade.</p><p>18.To secure reliable and sustainable supply chains and competitive economic growth, Canada and the EU continue to advance shared work on critical minerals, including through the Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials. Critical minerals are essential for the transition towards climate-neutrality of our economies, and we will continue to support integrated, secure and diversified supply chain development, science, technology and innovation cooperation, and enhance global environmental, social and governance criteria and standards. This will include joint efforts to engage and connect our respective businesses to accelerate two-way trade and investment that can help develop new supply sources for critical minerals. Canada and the EU agree that secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials enabling the green and digital transition is emerging as a shared challenge for the global community and will continue discussing how participation in the EU-proposed Critical Raw Materials Club would complement and strengthen ongoing initiatives to jointly address that challenge.</p><p>19.Economic security is a growing concern for governments around the world, and cooperation with partners and engagement with stakeholders will assist with better policy-making. To support this, Canada and the EU will launch a Canada-EU dialogue on economic security to exchange information on trends and risks of mutual concern which could affect our economic security and developments with regards to possible policy responses. </p><p> IV. Combatting climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution</p><p>20.With today's establishment of a Canada-EU Green Alliance, Canada and the EU continue to deepen our partnership on fighting climate change, protecting the environment and ocean, halting and reversing biodiversity loss and growing a strong, prosperous future. Recognising the key role of both Canada and the EU in leading global efforts to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to foster a circular nature-positive and global climate neutral economy by 2050, the Alliance is a testament to the depth and breadth of our shared ambition. Building on our extensive existing cooperation, the Alliance aims to take our partnership to the next level by further intensifying our political, technical, economic and scientific cooperation on climate action, environmental and ocean protection, energy transition, green industrial transformation, regulatory and business cooperation, research and innovation, climate finance, sustainable finance and biodiversity finance and cooperation at the multilateral level and supporting the climate-neutral transitions of third countries.</p><p>21.Recent natural disasters and extreme weather events have devastated communities in Canada and Europe alike. Canada is grateful for the support provided through the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism during the most significant forest fire season on record in Canada. We welcome the signature of an administrative arrangement to improve the sharing of information and best practices on how to respond to emergencies. Canada is pleased to facilitate the exportof Canadian-built fire-fighting aircraft to bolster the EU's and Member States' fleets.</p><p>22.We recognize that evenmore ambitious action is required to mitigate and build resilience to climate change, underpinned by an unwavering commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and ensuring a credible path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the upcoming 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), we will work together to promote decisive global action to tackle the climate crisis and to set the direction for future global climate efforts on the basis of the Global Stock Take recommendations. We will work together to accelerate the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels no later than 2050 and end the construction of new coal-fired power generation in a manner consistent with the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Recognizing the importance of increasing energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy, we will work towards the full and effective implementation of the Global Energy Pledge to collectively double the rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030 and to triple the world's installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 to 11 Terawatts, while respecting each country's national energy mix. We will also work to support the most vulnerable countries, including by delivering on climate finance commitments, calling on contributors to raise their ambition, and establishing funding arrangements on loss and damage. We will continue to convene the Ministerial on Climate Action with China, and will continue to lead global action on short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, under the Global Methane Pledge, the Global Methane Initiative, the International Methane Emissions Observatory and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.</p><p>23.We will lead the wayto mobilise partners around the world for the signature, ratification and effective implementation of the High Seas Treaty and for the swift and full implementation of the historic Kunming-Montr\u00e9al Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF), agreed to in Montreal. To this end, we will work together to develop ambitious nature-positive policies, mainstreaming biodiversity into all sectors.We share the objective to prevent global deforestation, and we intend to work together and with others to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, including as they relate to global supply chains, while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation.We will also cooperate towards substantially and progressively increasing the mobilisation of financial resources to support international biodiversity objectives, in line with the goals and the targets of the KMGBF.</p><p>24.We recognize that carbon pricing is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to spur related investment and innovation in the interest of the people's health and well-being.In that regard, Canada and the EU reaffirm their support for the Call to Action for Paris Aligned Carbon Markets, launched at the Paris Summitfor a New Global Financing Pact. Canada welcomes the EU as the most recent Partner to join the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge to expand the use of carbon pricing globally by strengthening existing systems and supporting emerging ones. Canada and the EU commit to continue exchanges on their carbon pricing systems and working closely on measures to address carbon leakage risks in a non-discriminatory manner including on next steps for cooperation on the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We will also address emissions intensity of the steel and aluminium manufacturing industries and advance manufacturing, re-manufacturing and recycling of steel and aluminium, both at home and abroad, and will continue cooperating closely in bilateral and multilateral fora.</p><p>25. We are committed to ending plastic pollution by 2040 and will work together, including through the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee and High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, to develop a dedicated ambitious and effective international legally binding instrument.</p><p>26.Through the Canada-EU Ocean Partnership, we are increasing cooperation on ocean governance, conservation, science, and sustainable use. In this context, we welcome the first Ocean Partnership Forum that took place in October 2022, and look forward to the next Forum planned for 2025. We will work together to achieve an ambitious Our Ocean Conference in Greece in 2024 and UN Ocean Conference in Nice in 2025.</p><p> V. Research and innovation cooperation and responsible digital innovation</p><p>27. We reaffirm our support for collaborative partnerships between our science research communities. Today, we are pleased to announce the completion of substantive negotiations on Canada's association to Pillar II of Horizon Europe, which once signed and implemented will provide new opportunities for international science partnerships on global challenges.</p><p>28.As strategic partners in emerging technologies and cutting-edge research, we will contribute solutions to global challenges and provide new economic opportunities. We are launching the Canada-EU Digital Partnership, which will allow us to deepen our engagement on areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), online platform governance and accountability, and quantum technologies, secure international connectivity and cyber security, digital skills and digital credentials and digital identities.</p><p>29.Canada and the EU share an interest in fostering safer, more inclusive digital environments. To this end, the Canada-EU Digital Partnership will be an important forum to collaborate on efforts to advance the accountability of online platforms such as social media and online marketplaces   in a way that enhances the respect for all human rights online. We are committed to holding online platforms accountable to mitigate the negative effects of content on their services on systemic societal risks, including gender-based violence, notably by giving their users tools and resources to protect themselves, and by mandating significantly more transparency for our societies over online content moderation.</p><p>30. Canada and the EU have a longstanding collaboration in advancing responsible design, development and use of AI, including through key multilateral forums like the G7, through the Hiroshima AI Process, and the Global Partnership on AI, where both are founding members. Canada and the EU are also among the most advanced jurisdictions in the world regarding the regulation of AI technologies. We are committed to working together on the global governance of digital and other emerging technologies, like AI, rooted in a risk-based approach, the protection of safety and respect for human rights and the rules-based international order, supported by appropriate accountability mechanisms. In support of this, we will collaborate to ensure applicable regulatory measures. As we continue our respective work on AI governance and regulatory frameworks, we commit to work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to share information and strive for solutions to facilitate the interoperability of our domestic approaches, helping to ensure AI actors in Canada and Europe have the greatest possible access to international markets to advance the safe, secure and trustworthy commercialization of this technology.</p><p>31. We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. To this end, we will cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards levels to protect consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyber incidents. We will also strengthen collaboration in upholding international norms of responsible state behaviour in cyber space, notably through the UN with the establishment of a Program of Action for cybersecurity and joint diplomatic responses to counter malicious behaviour. We will also seek opportunities to enhance cooperation and coordination on cyber capacity building efforts and exchange information on regulatory measures.</p><p>32.Further to the G7 Action Plan for Building a Secure and Resilient Digital Infrastructure, Canada and the EU intend to support secure international connectivity and explore possible new routes of international communication infrastructure to strengthen network resilience.</p><p>33.We recognize the transformative role of digital technologies in enhancing economic growth and sustainability, and the need to ensure that they respect human rights and democracy. We aim to ensure Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) in compliance with relevant rules in the respective jurisdictions, including data protection rules. We also welcome the EU   Canada close cooperation on the EU's adequacy decision to ensure its continuity.</p><p> VI. Advancing international peace and security</p><p>34.We welcome increased Canada-EU cooperation on security and defence, including the upcoming administrative arrangement which confirms Canada's participation in the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation Project on network of logistics hubs. We will seek to further deepen our cooperation through enhancing our security and defence dialogue, identifying opportunities for joint naval activities and strengthened collaboration on cyber security and the climate security nexus. We reaffirm the importance of further strengthening and deepening the mutually reinforcing and beneficial EU-NATO partnership, while fully respecting the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity, transparency and decision-making autonomy. We will advance the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and meaningful participation of women and youth in prevention, mediation and resolution, in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.</p><p>35. In support of our joint efforts in combatting terrorism and serious transnational crime, we welcome the finalisation of the negotiations that pave the way for the conclusion of a new Canada-EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data Agreement. This Agreement will provide a solid basis for the transfer and use of PNR data and ensure the capacity to effectively and efficiently prevent and fight terrorism and serious transnational crime while upholding privacy protections and protecting human rights.</p><p> VII. Promoting Shared Values and the Rules-Based International Order</p><p>36.Democracy, human rights, gender equality and the rule of law remain universal principles that guide international action for both Canada and the EU. We are concerned with the ongoing backlash against gender equality and the rights of women, girls and LGBTI persons, including increased incidents of gender-based violence, including gender-based violence that is amplified by the use of technology.We will continue to call for respect for the rights of all women and girls, not only in Afghanistan and Iran, but around the world. We reaffirm our commitment to take concerted and collective action against arbitrary detention and to work closely to anchor its principles in the international legal and normative framework, as well as to promote the biennial UN General Assembly Resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty. In 2023, Canadian observers have participated in EU election observation missions in Guatemala, Liberia, Maldives, Paraguay, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, and Canada will continue to work alongside the EU in electoral observation and the support of democratic principles and values.</p><p>37.We will continue to strengthen our collaboration to counter foreign threats to democracy, including through platforms like the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. We will continue to work together to protect information integrity   grounded in inclusion, human rights and the rule of law   with the objective of defending against and increasing citizen and societal resilience to information manipulation and disinformation both online and offline, including through working on the development of international norms and principles, such as those in the Global Declaration on Information Integrity Online. We call on all foreign actors to cease and to refrain from interference activities, aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and processes and our economic prosperity. We will continue to work together on digital justice, and, in this context, welcome the first EU-Canada informal senior-level dialogue on justice issues, held in May 2022.</p><p>38.The EU and Canada will make resolute efforts to uphold the rules-based international order with the UN at its core. We will strive for a well-functioning, reformed multilateral system, with an effective and sustainably funded UN. We will endeavour to work towards an effective, inclusive and networked multilateral system that is capable of facing new global realities and remain true to the rules and principles of the UN Charter. We are committed to working together with all partners to reinforce and reform global governance in line with 'Our Common Agenda'. We are determined to seize the opportunities represented by the 2024 Summit of the Future and the 2025 World Social Summit to develop a system that is resilient and as relevant today as when it was created.</p><p>39.We are committed to cooperate to reform the WTO so that it is better equipped to tackle modern day imperatives. We will work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024, including with respect to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system.</p><p>40.Canada and the EU agree to explore the possibility of establishing a new dialogue on humanitarian issues under the SPA. We will work to address priorities of the global community, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)   both at home and abroad, including mobilising finances to close the SDG financing gap. In particular, we will also focus on delivering better, bigger and more effective Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximize development impact. We will also sustain our support to the necessary reforms to the multilateral system and its development banks, and financing for global public goods such as climate, biodiversity, or pandemic prevention, while preserving the focus on poverty eradication and shared prosperity, in line with the SDGs. We will also seek to prevent fragmentation through the transformation of the governance of the international financial architecture to make it more effective, transparent and accountable. We will contribute to strengthening global health security to better prevent, prepare and respond to current and future health emergencies, including by jointly promoting shared priorities for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of an effective, ambitious and legally binding new pandemic agreement, and the targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations, by May 2024. We also support the Pandemic Fund. We welcome plans for the first Canada-EU Health Policy Dialogue under the SPA, scheduled for early 2024. Global hunger has been rising since 2015 and has been intensified by rising food and energy insecurity.We stand ready to continue contributing to the global fertilizers production and value chains in order to ensure food security, decreasing dependency on Russian and Belarusian production.</p><p>41.We have also agreed to deepen our partnership in support of high-quality global infrastructure development, in line with the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment and EU Global Gateway initiative's common objectives.</p><p>42.We recognize the importance of sustainable, resilient andquality infrastructure throughout the world. We are committed to working together towards the joint G7 aim of mobilizing $600 billion in financing through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the EU Global Gateway initiative. Under these initiatives, we welcome our collaboration in support of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships with South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal, including under the Great Green Wall initiative. We will continue our close cooperation on the Kiwa Initiative, a multi-donor program that aims to strengthen climate change resilience in the Pacific Islands through nature-based solutions. FinDev Canada will continue to partner with EU-based development finance institutions to advance sustainable infrastructure solutions in support of positive development, climate and nature outcomes.</p><p> VIII.

In addition to the urgent need for full transparency about what has happened with those funds the protesters should be delivering most of it to the Pacheedaht leadership and community who have continually and respectfully asked for these outsiders to leave their ancestral lands.</p><p>With Trump-like misinformation about B.C.'s forestry practices the year-long Fairy Creek campaign has continued even though major logging deferrals were agreed to by the Pacheedaht, Teal Jones and the B.C. government months ago.</p><p>Lawlessness is escalating at Fairy Creek with illegal tree falling, continued civil disobedience, attacks on the hardworking RCMP enforcing a legal injunction, littering and vandalism including defacing road safety signs. Protester presence adds to already high forest fire risks in the area and there are significant human waste issues there.</p><p>All taxpayers are being burdened by paying the huge costs of policing and protecting the public and the Pacheedaht people.</p><p>The protesters and others supporting them are acting in a paternal and colonial manner by demanding the Pacheedaht people adhere to the protesters' views of logging and resource development and promoting conflict in the Pacheedaht community.

In BC specifically, in 2017, we emitted 68 million tonnes of CO2 or so we claimed.</p><p>The problem is that this number did not include the 176 million tonnes of CO2 that BC forest fires contributed.</p><p>We are leaving the pollution created from burning forests out of this number so we can meet our targets, but it does not accurately reflect the amount of CO2 entering our atmosphere.</p><p>The urgency of the climate crisis is being hidden by false information and therefore our leaders can make decisions disregarding our dying ecosystems rather than saving them, without any contradiction.</p><p>You are probably wondering what you can do to help fight this atrocious problem.</p><p>First, don't forget about the wildfire crisis as soon as the season has passed.

Buried lines weren\u2019t feasible, the challenges of the rocky terrain being the primary complication.  </p><p>Each new pole measured up to 19 metres tall, and together, they dotted the connection along a winding 45-kilometre pathway from the park\u2019s east gate to a new substation at the former power plant site, sharing the major corridors provided by Highway 16, Snaring Road and the Trans Mountain pipeline. </p><p>Those wooden poles, however, opened up the possibility of direct and negative impacts on several wetland areas and bird species. </p><p>Representatives from the Jasper Environmental Association (JEA) were there during the public hearings. </p><p>\u201cThe JEA was encouraged to send in an intervenor statement as we really had some concerns about it,\u201d said Jill Seaton, former president of the environmental group. </p><p>But there was another risk factor: if ever there was a forest fire, the power poles would be vulnerable. As much as they may be treated to weather the ravages of time and even resist fire, the fact remains that they are still made from trees. </p><p>That liability was on the JEA\u2019s mind as well. </p><p>\u201cWe also pointed out a concern for forest fires. We sent a letter to the mayor and council on our concerns,\u201d she said, citing how a number of the poles located on the west side of the Athabasca River were destroyed by the wildfire in September. </p><p>Mayor Richard Ireland recalled the issue as it was debated in the months and years leading up to the Jasper Interconnection project.  </p><p>\u201cOur primary concern was exactly what we ran into: that is, what is the redundancy? With a line basically from Hinton to Jasper\u2026 that's lots of exposed ground out there. Lots of trees,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWe were concerned from a municipal perspective about backup, recognizing that now if you've just added 40 or 45 kilometers of overhead line, things can go wrong like forest fires, for example. We suggested at the time that maybe at least the primary generator that was already here be resurfaced and upgraded and maintained as potential backup capacity. We raised the issue. At the end of the day, the decisions made outside the community came to the conclusion that Jasper was \u2018appropriately served\u2019\u2026 by the connection to the grid.\u201d </p><p>That connection, he added, also put Jasper at the end of the line. Any disruption in service to the east of town could not be fixed with any transmission from the west. If Jasper still had a power plant, the concerns related to the power lines would have disappeared. </p><p>But power plants are not invincible structures. Mayor Ireland recalled an industrial fire caused by a faulty fuel hose that totally destroyed the town\u2019s generating station one frigid February morning in 1974.  </p><p>If Jasper still had its own power plant, and a wildfire raged right into it, the town would have lost electricity just as easily as it did with the transmission lines going down during the Chetamon Wildfire. It could perhaps have even been in a more profound predicament: it\u2019s one thing to replace power poles burned down but another thing entirely to rebuild a power plant. </p><p>ATCO, for its part, conducted a feasibility study followed by public and Indigenous engagement and then prepared a Detailed Impact Assessment to consider not only the then-proposed Interconnection Project\u2019s impact on plants and animals but also other environmental considerations. The energy provider still stands by its decision to satisfy Jasper\u2019s electricity demands via transmission lines, a decision that was reinforced by the Alberta Utilities Commission. </p><p>The Palisades Power Plant was at the end of its service life, and ATCO needed to develop a suitable replacement based on many factors.  </p><p>\u201cOur perspective on the project has not changed,\u201d ATCO told the Fitzhugh via email. \u201cWe still believe the construction of the transmission line was the best option.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1637f9e3aff9482a9102169156571678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66KY-F0W1-DY9S-T311-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>02:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 12, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Winters in particular are milder, rising 2.2\u00b0C on average, with variations across the province.</p><p>Meanwhile, the region that includes the Lower Mainland has seen a 14 per cent increase in precipitation.</p><p>That data is a few years old. After the roller-coaster of the past two years, with its record-breaking heat, cold, and rain coming on each other\u2019s heels, they might have to update the charts a bit.</p><p>We\u2019re seeing more extremes in B.C. , it seems. When it\u2019s dry and hot, it\u2019s going to set off forest fires and heat alerts, when it\u2019s cold and wet, it\u2019s going to soak and chill us even more.</p><p>Yet I can\u2019t help but notice that the weather this year isn\u2019t all bad.</p><p>Not great for a lot of berry crops, sure, awful for orchards, probably pretty crummy for potatoes.</p><p>But mild temperatures and plenty of rain are pretty good for a lot of native plants. The weather we\u2019ve had this year is closer to the what was normal for this area before humans started burning coal and oil on a massive scale a century and a half ago.</p><p>But there is no normal, not anymore.</p><p>This year might be followed by one that\u2019s hot and dry. Or cool and dry, or hot with sudden storms. Maybe we\u2019ll get a typhoon next, or another tornado like the waterspout last year that touched down just off of UBC.</p><p>If we knew what was normal, we might be able to better plan for the future, for our forest fire prevention needs, for agriculture, for flood prevention and disaster response.</p><p>But we broke normal. Climate change isn\u2019t some abstract thing that\u2019s going to happen in the future, it\u2019s here now.</p><p>The weather we grew up with wasn\u2019t quite normal. Our future weather will be even less so.</p><p>TRUTH Painful</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LANTIM-news20220623PQTA0002783539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LANTIM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65S4-KX91-JD2C-J4PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Wednesday, July 19, 2023, 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: JUNE, 5, 2023) Atwater Avenue between Cawthra Road and Alexandra Avenue in Ward 1<br/><br/> Cherry Post Drive, between Camilla Road and Corsair Road in Ward 7.

General Store, and Morgan David, employee of the Revelstoke Lumber Co., made the first known ascent of Mount Mackenzie. The trip took them 48 hours, and they marveled at the abundant alpine wildflowers and the stunning views.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">120 years ago: Revelstoke Herald, Aug. 10, 1901</p><p>Dr. McLean came back from Ferguson last night bringing with him J. McTaggart, a miner, who was injured by the premature explosion of a shot at the Metropolitan claim last Wednesday. Owing to some misunderstanding, the shot was fired before he left the lower workings of the mine and blew him completely off the face of the mountain, rolling him down some 300ft.</p><p>110 years ago: Mail-Herald, Aug. 9, 1911</p><p>The Vernon Hotel on Douglas Street was been taken over by Mrs. Hanbury and was to be changed into a first class rooming and apartment house. The entire building was being thoroughly renovated and refurnished, including the installation of steam heat in every room.</p><p>100 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 11, 1921</p><p>The new automobile ambulance for the Queen Victoria Hospital was finished and was to be in readiness for calls by the end of the week. The ambulance was mostly built in Revelstoke by locals. It was put together at the Revelstoke Garage and the body was built on a Ford chassis.</p><p>90 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 14, 1931</p><p>According to Arthur O. Wheeler, honorary president of the Alpine Club of Canada and Canadian representative of the International Commission on glaciers, general retreat of the ice fields of the Rocky Mountains is ample evidence that Canadian winters are becoming milder. Mr. Wheeler declared that the Robson glacier has retreated 790 feet since he made initial observations in 1911. His investigations in the past week have shown a remarkable change.</p><p>80 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 14, 1941</p><p>Four cars of ice were brought to Revelstoke the week before last, when the hot weather of recent weeks depleted the stock of the local plant of Inland Ice and Cold Storage Co. At the peak of the heat wave, the local plant dispensed 100 tons a day to the CPR for air conditioning and refrigeration purposes.</p><p>70 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 9, 1951</p><p>According to federal surveyors, the Big Bend section of the Trans-Canada Highway between Revelstoke and Golden may be re-routed as the area could be utilized as a water storage basin for the production of paper. It is believed that it would result in a considerably shorter highway being built between the two municipalities if the survey shows promising results.</p><p>60 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 10, 1961</p><p>The heavy pull of grey-blue smoke hanging over the city and area Sunday afternoon and evening was the result of a forest fire in the Lytton district. Smoke drifting for hundreds of miles following a forest fire is not unusual.</p><p>50 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 12, 1971</p><p>Kel Collins, mine superintendent for Mount Copeland Mine, spoke at a Rotary meeting, and told the members that the min had recovered 1.23 million pounds of molybdenum metal in fourteen months of production. The mine, located high on Mount Copeland, was then the highest mine in the world.</p><p>40 years ago: Revelstoke Review, Aug. 12, 1981</p><p>Clara Lim retired from Vancouver General Hospital after 30 years of service as a nurse, rising to the position of Director of Nursing at the hospital. Clara Lim was born and raised in Revelstoke, and was one of ten children of early residents Wong Kwong and Yee Von Kwong, who ran a laundry where the Senior Citizens Centre is now located.</p><p>30 years ago: Revelstoke Times, Aug. 14, 1991</p><p>Canadian musician Bryan Adams performed in Centennial Park at Revelstoke to a crowd of about 11,000 people. The performance was part of Music 91, a province-wide celebration of music. Adams was chosen as the performer for the Revelstoke concert, with Chrissy Steele appearing as the opening act.</p><p>Sign up for the Revelstoke Review's daily newsletter.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>@RevelstokeRevue <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@revelstoketimesreview.comLike\">editor@revelstoketimesreview.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REVTME-4199712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REVTME2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-W5T1-F103-312M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438270</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Revelstoke Review</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 15, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0004SZ2</classCode><className>COLD STORAGE CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS493120 REFRIGERATED WAREHOUSING &amp;
