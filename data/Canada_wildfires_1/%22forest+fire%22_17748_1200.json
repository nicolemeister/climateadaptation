JOHN'S, N.L. - An out-of-control wildfire forced officials to order residents to flee their homes in the central Labrador community of Churchill Falls on Wednesday evening.</p><p>Local officials issued an alert asking everyone in the town to be out by 8:15 p.m. local time, \"due to changing conditions of the fire around the community.\"</p><p>The notice asked residents to head east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, which is a three-hour drive along a remote, two-lane highway.</p><p>\"I am in touch with officials and we will be there to help in any way we can,\" Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey said in a social media post sharing the alert. \"Please be safe and check on friends and neighbours at this time.\"</p><p>Churchill Falls is home to about 700 people, and the town sits along the Trans-Labrador Highway, which cuts across Labrador's vast, wooded interior. The Churchill Falls generating station is about four kilometres east of the town's centre, and it supplies power to Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>The eastern Canadian province's online wildfire dashboard showed two fires burning near the community on Wednesday night. The closest was about 15 kilometres southwest of the town, encompassing an area of about seven square kilometres.</p><p>Officials advised anyone in Churchill Falls needing a ride to Happy Valley-Goose Bay to head to the town centre or the bus area at the generating station's staff housing facilities. Those arriving in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, which is Labrador's largest community, were advised to check in at the YMCA.</p><p>There were seven wildfires burning in Labrador on Wednesday, four of which were out of control. Three fires listed as \"being held,\" which means they were no longer spreading, were in the western part of the region. The four fires still spreading \u2014 including the blaze that forced the evacuation of Churchill Falls \u2014 were in central Labrador.</p><p>Five helicopters, four waterbombers and 38 ground crew members were all working to douse the flames, Newfoundland and Labrador forest fire duty officer Bryan Oke said earlier on Wednesday.</p><p>Oke said he and his crews were keeping a close eye on conditions near Churchill Falls. Temperatures there hit 32 C earlier in the day, and he said winds were stronger than anticipated. As of about 3 p.m. on Wednesday, officials said the fire risk in the area was \"extreme.\"</p><p>Forest fires are not uncommon in Labrador, especially at the beginning of the summer when thunder and lightning storms are common as temperatures rise, Oke said. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 19, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7bf40d97ed3d4d97b6f6af27eb4f001c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C99-FTS1-JBVR-30BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><timeReceived>08:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 19, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It grew from six square kilometres to about 100 on Friday, advancing 21 kilometres toward the town in just four hours, he said.</p><p>\"We hope that the winds change later this evening, and we are praying for rain,\" Furey told reporters during a video conference call from Labrador. </p><p>Labrador City is in the western part of Labrador, and it's home to about 7,450 people. They were told to pack up and leave at around 5:30 p.m. local time on Friday. Municipal officials asked them to head east to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, a six-hour drive along the remote, two-lane Trans-Labrador Highway, which cuts through the wilderness in the southern part of the region.</p><p>There were more than 1,000 cars on the road, Furey said. Pictures on social media showed lineups of hundreds of cars waiting to get into Churchill Falls, in central Labrador, which is the only spot along the way to refuel.</p><p>Cindy Michelin, co-owner of Strickland's Auto and Gas in Churchill Falls, said they stayed open all night to serve all those people. Her staff pulled all-nighters working the tills and the pumps, and volunteers were outside all night directing traffic in and out of the gas bar, she said in an interview.</p><p>Churchill Falls was evacuated because of fires last month, and Michelin said people there were happy to help since they knew all too well what everyone from Labrador City was going through.</p><p>Meanwhile, officials in the town of Wabush, which is about seven kilometres southwest of Labrador City, issued a notice to its residence asking them to be prepared to evacuate. A similar alert went out to residents of Fermont, Que., about 30 kilometres south of Labrador City, on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Furey said there were three water bombers from Newfoundland and Labrador in the air trying to douse the flames near Labrador City. A fourth was working on a fire near Happy Valley-Goose Bay. The province has requested help from the federal government and from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, the premier said.</p><p>Wildfires have already devoured twice as much land in Newfoundland and Labrador this summer than in typical years, said Blair Adams with the province's Foresty Department.</p><p>\"And of course, the extreme (evacuation) events that we've had are absolutely unusual,\" Adams added.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 13, 2024.</p><p>\u2014 Written by Sarah Smellie in St. John's, N.L.</p><p>Note to readers: This is a corrected version of the story. A previous version attributed a paraphrased quote about the amount of land burned this summer to Jamie Chippett. In fact, it was Blair Adams who provided the information.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b286fc854d2d49fc9c12f62cd0b0e50f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CGD-T9B1-JBVR-30BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><timeReceived>03:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 13, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Labrador City, N.L.</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Atlantic</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001794</classCode><className>VEHICLE TRAFFIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000CP14</classCode><className>CONFERENCE CALLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS171</classCode><className>NEWFOUNDLAND &amp; LABRADOR, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He was born and raised in Southend and co-owns Bird's Confectionary, the only gas station in town.\u00a0</p><p>Bird is staying behind with his family to keep the fuel station running for those leaving the community.</p><p>\"We are people of the north ... and we're wired a little differently than the folks up in the big cities,\" he said.</p><p>\"We will give a good battle before we run.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation issued an evacuation order for Southend. It's the second\u00a0of the nine communities that make up Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation to have a\u00a0full evacuation order\u00a0issued in August because of northern wildfires.\u00a0</p><p>Another of its\u00a0communities,\u00a0Sandy Bay, has been under an evacuation order for the past 12 days, said Peter Ballantyne\u00a0Chief Peter Beatty.</p><p>Dozens of members were evacuated from a third, Deschambault Lake,\u00a0due to the effects of\u00a0heavy smoke.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.saskpublicsafety.ca/emergencies-and-response/active-incidents\">According to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency,</url> the Merkley fire, approaching Southend, has grown to about 30,506 hectares (or about 305 square kilometres, spanning wider than Saskatoon).\u00a0</p><p>Bird is concerned the fire could cut off access to Highway 102, the only southern access road from the community. That would mean no ground transportation for food or gas.</p><p>On Thursday evening, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://hotline.gov.sk.ca/\">Saskatchewan Highway Hotline</url> showed the road was affected by fire, but not cut off.</p><p>By Thursday morning, more than 400 evacuees took that road\u00a0to the Jonas Roberts Memorial Community Centre in La Ronge for soup, sandwiches and snacks on their longer journey south.</p><p>Kevin Roberts, the community centre's director of sports and recreation, said he was called about the evacuation Wednesday and got the staff together to prepare food for the evacuees.</p><p>\"We're accustomed to dealing with situations like this. We always come together to lend a hand for our northern neighbours,\" he said.</p><p/><p>The vice-president of operations for the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency said the Southend evacuation was triggered because the Merkely fire was pushed northwest by a \"not normal\" weather system for the province.</p><p>\"That finger of fire actually approached Highway 102. It did not cross at that time, but it came relatively close,\" said Steve Roberts.</p><p>The fire was within 20 kilometres\u00a0of Southend at that point, he said.</p><p>\"Our crews are on that fire. They've been holding that fire at the road, [and the] road has not been closed permanently.\"</p><p>There have been \"intermittent closures\" as crews worked in the area, or because smoke limited visibility, he said.</p><p>There's been no infrastructure loss, including power and telecommunication lines along that highway, said Roberts.</p><p>More resources needed to fight fires: chief</p><p>Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation held a virtual press conference late Thursday afternoon to provide updates on the three communities affected by the wildfires.</p><p>\"We called for an evacuation and then the next morning, at 6 a.m., we went to discuss the logistics of getting those people out, as we had a very small window of opportunity,\" said\u00a0Chief\u00a0Beatty.</p><p>A mixture of coach buses and three school buses sent from La Ronge helped evacuate people\u00a0to Prince Albert, Saskatoon and Regina.</p><p/><p>The chief also called on the provincial government to listen to First Nations more on wildfire response.</p><p>\"These fires are not being given the resources that are needed to extinguish the fires, let alone manage them,\" he said.</p><p>\"For the most part, these individuals that are trying to manage these fires, are using back burning, which is using a fire against fire, because they don't have the resources to put out the fire.\"</p><p>When contacted by CBC\u00a0for a response, the\u00a0Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency said it could not\u00a0immediately provide a comment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wildfires in west</emphasis></p><p>In Saskatchewan's northwest, Birch Narrows Dene Nation had previously been under an evacuation order, though its residents returned home after several days, according to Daryl Wright, emergency response plan co-ordinator for the Meadow Lake Tribal Council.</p><p>Now, English River First Nation - another\u00a0Meadow Lake Tribal Council community, with its main offices in Patuanak, about 425 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon,\u00a0is within range of another fire.\u00a0</p><p>Wright said the wildfire is about eight to 10\u00a0kilometres from the community, and it appears that several homes east of Patuanak, as well as a trapping business, have been damaged.</p><p>The public safety agency could not confirm that structures had been damaged.</p><p>\"The community is definitely concerned,\" Wright said.

If implemented, it seems to us that this would leave a relatively small acreage riddled with trails and looking more like a clear-cut logging operation than a healthy forest containing a few hiking paths.</p><p>Having said that, we are also deeply concerned about the proposal to build yet another expensive access to the new area, starting from the cul de sac at the end of Wright Road. This is not a well thought out idea, for several seemingly obvious reasons. Wright Road is already used to capacity by local residents, and a massive increase in traffic would affect our safe access to our homes. There is absolutely no room to park horse trailers, pickups and cars in the existing cul de sac, particularly since there is one residential driveway in place, which further reduces the parking area, and more importantly will make it impossible for emergency vehicles to deal with the inevitable risk of human-caused forest fire in already existing drought conditions. This would not only threaten our vibrant farming community in the Cranberry Valley, but would also threaten the Maxwell Lake watershed. What's more important, folks, Disneyland or drinking water? Any increase in fire risk is simply unacceptable in our present parched environment, and we find it alarming that parks and rec personnel have not taken this issue into account when they suggest opening our neighbourhood to unlimited public access! By way of a positive suggestion, there is already a road up to Mount Maxwell Provincial Park and it would be more practical, saferand a lot easier on the taxpayer to build a properly designed parking lot at a designated location within hiking (or horseriding, or biking) distance that would serve both parks, and would also help to avoid introducing a threat to our farming community.</p><p>CAROLINE AND ANDY HICKMAN, GANDERS HATCH FARM, WRIGHT ROAD</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20240529PGWA0004403635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4X-0JP1-JD2C-J517-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

It\u2019s the day that 72 twelfth-graders donned cap and gown to receive their long-awaited high school diploma. </p><p>The school\u2019s gymnasium hummed with anticipation as family, friends, and teachers came together to celebrate the achievements of their graduates. </p><p>The convocation was followed by a banquet and safe grad party at the Niverville Heritage Centre. </p><p>Three days prior, these graduates paraded through the streets of the community to much fanfare in an autocade that has become a standing tradition for Niverville graduates since COVID-19. </p><p>Principal Kimberley Funk opened Wednesday\u2019s convocation with an address to the graduates. She focused on the relevant message held within a children\u2019s picture book entitled The Courage of the Little Hummingbird. </p><p>This story revolves around a seemingly insignificant bird who is the only animal brave enough to take action in the face of a great forest fire. Scooping water into its tiny beak from a nearby stream, it works tirelessly to snuff out the massive flames, undaunted by the enormity of the task at hand. </p><p>\u201cThe book emphasizes things like bravery, resilience, and the importance of individual contributions in the face of overwhelming challenges,\u201d Funk told the students. \u201cWith its beautiful illustrations, the story of the little hummingbird encourages children to take action, no matter how small, and to believe in their capacity to make a difference in the world. It\u2019s the perfect story for a time like this.\u201d </p><p>Funk encouraged the group to go into the world with courage, taking brave action where required and counting on their efforts to make a powerful difference. </p><p>\u201cYour generation is uniquely positioned to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time,\u201d Funk said. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s advocating for social justice, protecting the environment, or contributing to your community, you have the potential to be a force for good.\u201d </p><p>This year\u2019s valedictorian, selected by his peers, was Jack Grantham. Grantham was also awarded this year\u2019s Governor General\u2019s bronze medal for earning the highest academic average throughout Grades 11 and 12. </p><p>From the podium, Grantham shared an anecdote his father had likewise shared with him: \u201cNever do just enough. Always do more than enough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat is the beauty of all the people on this stage with me,\u201d Grantham told his peers. \u201cYou all strive for more and strive to do more than just enough. After all, doing more than just enough is where you can find the best parts of life\u2026 Contrary to popular opinion, the greatest accomplishment in life is not discovering what you want to be. The true accomplishment is finding out who you want to be. That is doing more than just enough.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-b773261de073454da0be515c5729c4bb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBT-8841-DY9S-T0YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><timeReceived>11:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 26, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JZH</classCode><className>HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JYC</classCode><className>CERTIFICATES, DEGREES &amp; DIPLOMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009P0G</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DE9L</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION GRADUATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009OZR</classCode><className>PRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009U8Y</classCode><className>CHILDREN'S LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JZH</classCode><className>HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

While certain diagnoses for urban firefighters are presumed to be work related, forest firefighters don't have automatic recognition for WSIB. Instead, they must jump through hoops to prove a strong causal link between their exposure and diagnosis   all while managing a serious illness. It's shameful,\" said OPSEU/SEFPO President JP Hornick.</p><p>\"The Ontario Government treats forest firefighters' health as it does climate change, with a willful ignorance for scientific evidence,\" added Noah Freedman, eight-year veteran forest firefighter and Vice-President of OPSEU/SEFPO Local 703. \"The Health and Safety document we filed with the government, and their response, is proof that they have been willfully ignorant and negligent for years, expecting that no one was paying attention. Some of us are still here, we are all dying, and we will no longer be silenced.\"</p><p>Last year's wildfire season was record-breaking. Even those who weren't close to an active fire felt the impacts. Forest firefighters spend 16-hour days, week after week, inhaling carcinogenic emissions to keep Ontario residents and communities safe.</p><p>Unfortunately, forest firefighters don't receive proper health and safety training on the toxic conditions they are exposed to on the frontlines, despite repeated recommendations to the government, including from the Ministry of Natural Resources' joint health and safety committee. Shockingly, forest firefighters are still advised to cover their mouths with dry cloths like bandanas   a method that was proven to be ineffective in the 1990s.</p><p>The Ford government has the power to fix this crisis and protect forest fire workers before the 2024 forest fire season starts. Forest firefighters risk it all for Ontarians and the Ford government must recognize them for the crucial work they do, and ensure they have all the protections they need.</p><p>\"The government has had many opportunities to change the classification of forest firefighters so that they receive the same presumptive cancer coverage as other firefighters. Adding insult to the injuries that long-term forest firefighters are abandoned to live with, the MNRF makes workers pay out-of-pocket for training. But then refuses to train workers properly to protect themselves from inhaling carcinogens,\" said NDP MPP for Thunder Bay   Superior North, Lise Vaugeois. \"The contracts are short, poorly paid and guarantee that Ontario is not building the expertise needed to fight the ever-growing fires coming because of the climate crisis and this year's very dry winter.\"</p><p>SOURCE  Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU/SEFPO)</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2024/26/c8094.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2024/26/c8094.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20240226C8094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BDT-BBX1-JC8H-P0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 26, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

R. Martin, but alas, it is not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, the moniker belongs to an upcoming art exhibition by Yukon-based artist Nicole Bauberger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Set to be displayed at Whitehorse's Northern Front Studio from Jan. 2 to 26, \"Fish and Fire\" features several installations crafted from repurposed bicycle reflectors, glass and other materials.</p><p>As the exhibition's title implies, guests to Northern Front Studio can view Bauberger's bike reflector fish and a central piece that utilizes white and orange reflectors to abstractly recreate the likeness of a forest fire, among other installations.</p><p>The inception of \"Fire and Fish\" was in 2022, when Bauberger's partner, who runs a local bike shop, noted that too many bike reflectors are shipped with new bikes. He asked her if there was anything she could use them for, and she asked him to start collecting them for her.</p><p>She ultimately decided to start making fish from the reflectors, an idea she credits in part to Nakai Theatre, who commissioned her and other artists in the spring of 2022 to create fish puppets to use in parades.</p><p>\"You know, a big thing of orange bike reflectors is beautiful. Like there's something that's really beautiful about it, and its beauty reminded me \u2014 kind of \u2014 of goldfish. And if you look at bike reflectors, they already have sort of a scaly pattern on them,\" Bauberger told the News.</p><p>The reflector fish are small and, according to Bauberger, relatively quick to produce. Each fish's body is made with a trapezoid-shaped bike tire reflector, while the fins are made from clear tape.</p><p>Bauberger's forest fire of reflectors is variously described by the artist as a \"kind of a painting, kind of a sculpture, and kind of a textile.\" It's made of white and orange bicycle reflectors and stands roughly six feet tall, with a width of about 40 inches.</p><p>\"I took a bunch of the bike reflectors, and if you imagine, drilling holes at the top and the bottom of the two sides, then tying them together in a kind of a grid. They come in white and orange, and so I was working with the idea of it being a depiction of a fire,\" Bauberger said.</p><p>\"Of course, the possibility of forest fire has been something that, you know, we're getting a little reprieve from thinking about it all the time right now because it's winter, but it was certainly something that was on all of our minds a lot this summer.\"</p><p>Prior to the upcoming exhibition, Bauberger's fish were displayed at the Dalton Trail Gallery, an outdoor trail near her home in Hillcrest where Bauberger began installing work during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, where they were hung in the trees and danced in the wind. They were also incorporated into the event Theatre in the Bush, along with the bike reflector fire display.</p><p>Speaking about what she hopes people take away from the exhibit, she says, \"People are invited to come to a show with their imaginations\" and that \"the radical freedom of the audience to make their interpretation is one of the core values of art\" for her. That said, she notes that \"Fish and Fire\" reflects some of her concerns about our \"collective material culture\" and the waste it generates.</p><p>Those interested can join Bauberger at Northern Front Studio for the exhibition's closing party on Jan. 26 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</p><p>Contact Matthew Bossons at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:matthew.bossons@yukon-news.com\">matthew.bossons@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2024 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20240102IYN4555410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B16-H331-JD2C-J0PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

We did get the six medical detox. We are still working with the City of Campbell River to take a look at another facility up closer to Peterson that will be social detox and second-stage housing, but we are very happy to work with the Wei Wai Kai First Nation on the Tsakwa'lutan\u00a0Lodge project that is going to be looking at a full culturally safe treatment centre over there as there.</p><p>I'm really excited to start heading engagements with the community about what our involuntary care looks like because we do\u00a0know that we have people who have multiple challenges, whether it be synthetic opioid addictions, brain injuries, or mental health issues that are really struggling to take care of themselves and are not safe out in our community either. It's being preyed on by some pretty relentless criminals, so I'm looking forward to that. I think we have made really great progress in Campbell River over the last four years, and I'm looking forward to continuing to do that.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province, and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive for in helping the province and Island hit those goals?</p><p>That's exactly right.</p><p>We're not only seeing forest fires but heat domes and other emergency weather events like floods coming at a rapid pace\u2014a lot faster than we thought they were going to. So we have taken a really good stand with our Clean BC, and we're actually watching carbon emissions go down five percent in the last little while. We have a way to go, but we are certainly on the right path.</p><p>I talk to people on Cortes about this all the time, and they are trying very hard to decrease their carbon footprint, but it's not something we can individually do. It's something we have to do as a society as a whole.</p><p>We are working with industry. We are looking at sustainable industry to be able to move our North Island forward in an economically way, so looking at all of those alternative energy projects, I think we are very well positioned for on the north end of Vancouver Island.</p><p>While areas of the North Island are growing in rental housing, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock in the riding?</p><p>We have heard John Rustad say he doesn't believe that the government should be involved in affordable housing, and we've had some really good examples in Campbell River of making that happen. But we still struggle in our rural\u00a0and remote\u00a0communities just because it's so expensive to do that. I believe the government needs to be at the table to help move forward with affordable housing, and we also need to make sure that we've got our developers feeling that they are supported enough that they can do that. So he (Eby) is committed to 300,000 homes over the next 10 years, and that's not just in the bigger centres, that's all over British Columbia and our rural and remote communities need it just as much as our urban and metropolitan areas as well.</p><p>School divisions in the North Island have policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit the school division\u2019s abilities to use these policies and resources?</p><p>Absolutely not. I believe that inclusion and diversity in our school systems is absolutely one of the most important.</p><p>Right now, we just watched Mr. Eby talk about enhancing our school systems by hiring 5700 new teachers into the province, making sure every school has a mental health officer, and making sure every K (kindergarten) to Grade 3 classroom\u00a0has a dedicated EA (education assistant) inside of it. We have also committed to 10,000 new before and aftercare child care spaces, which is fantastic.</p><p>You know, these are our kids and these are kids who are\u00a0going to be our future, so we need to make sure we set them up on their learning path in a successful way, and we are doing that by investing in infrastructure. We have 125 new builds or builds that are almost completed in this province. When Mr. Rustad was there, he cut all those budgets and currently just said he is going to increase class sizes by 20 per cent. We're going to see that in Surrey first but teachers, EAs, and administrators in our public school systems have been bargaining and fighting for classroom and composition size for years. I think it goes back to the 1970s, and they are finally in a position where that can happen, and we are finally in a position where we are going to see the lowest class sizes in a very long time, and he's going to reverse that and he's going to gut that system. I am very concerned about it.</p><p>The resource industry is very important in Campbell River and the North Island. What will the BC NDP do to help ensure job security in this sector?</p><p>It's no surprise to anybody that we are going through a transition in forestry, and we are doing that in collaboration with our rural, remote and Indigenous communities to make sure that everybody is on board.</p><p>We watched Mr. Rustad tank 30,000 forestry jobs under his leadership, and 20 mills in B.C. went down with absolutely no support for those communities, no support for those workers, no support for the Made in BC brand, and no support for communities and they lost millions of dollars in their tax base.</p><p>We have the job manufacturing\u00a0plan that we have been putting money back in to make sure those forestry workers have good, meaningful jobs while we're going through this transition. But at the end of the day, we want to grow a forestry industry that our kids and grandkids can actually work in. If we don't do it correctly\u00a0in a sustainable way, then we are going to end up losing it. I am very happy that we are doing this, yes, I know that it's hard on people, and I know that we are having\u00a0trouble getting fibre out of the bush, but we just saw the BC NDP platform committing to take a look at stumpage because I know that has been an issue, taking a look at getting the permits out faster, which I know has been an issue and also to take a look at BC TS which is the BC timber sales that help get those going. I've heard that, we've listened to anywhere from the Truck Loggers Association to Western Forest Products, to communities in between, and we are starting to come out the other side, and I was really happy to see that reflected in the platform.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Campbell River Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20241009PCB4653062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D52-4FK1-F0HF-802K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

The Goat interviewed each of the three MLA candidates running in the Prince George-Valemount riding about how they plan to advocate for Robson Valley residents. This is our interview with Conservative candidate Rosalyn Bird. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents can register to vote at elections.bc.ca/register until 11:59 p.m. on October 7th. </p><p>Advance voting is taking place from Thursday, October 10th, through Wednesday, October 16th (advance voting places will be closed for Thanksgiving on Monday the 14th). Advance voting is taking place at Elks Hall, 172 Holdway Street, in McBride and the Valemount Community Hall, 101 Gorse Street, in Valemount. </p><p>Rosalyn Bird has not previously held office. Prior to her bid for MLA, she served in the Canadian Forces for 22 years. During that time, she worked as a boatswain before working her way up to become a Naval Logistics Officer. Since her medical release in 2012, she has volunteered with the Legion. </p><p>\u201cI believe my unique blend of military and life expertise, leadership, and a deep commitment to public service \u2026 will benefit my constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cI am committed to making a difference, and am prepared to be a powerful advocate for the Prince George-Valemount riding.\u201d </p><p>Housing costs and economic concerns have been top of mind for the residents Bird has spoken with, she said. She hopes to bolster the tourism sector across the Robson Valley to support the rest of the economy. </p><p>\u201cWe have tremendous outdoor resources here in B.C., and we need to be highlighting those,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to find mechanisms for that to bring a stronger economy to smaller communities like McBride and Valemount.\u201d </p><p>If elected along with a Conservative government, Bird\u2019s first 100 days will largely be focused on supporting party leaders as they determine what the government\u2019s priorities are, she said. However, she raised agricultural land use policies as one of her priorities: she believes the current provincial government has not taken the needs of rural communities and the agriculture sector into account when developing zoning and land use policies. </p><p>\u201cI think there should be more authority at the local government level to address issues specific to their community, whether it be housing, education, or land use issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfect example in the Robson Valley where we have a number of pieces of land that have been purchased by a foreign owner in the past few years that aren\u2019t being farmed. Those are the types of things where we need to be much more cognizant of how they\u2019re going to impact our communities for future generations.\u201d </p><p>Bird has heard concerns from Robson Valley residents about inequity between rural and urban schools, and says she believes these inequities exist throughout the province. She hopes to explore possibilities such as employing more education assistants, offering alternative learning methods like online classes, or using different funding models to correct these inequities. </p><p>\u201cThe enrollment numbers in [rural] schools do not equate to having teachers that cover the vast range of subjects you would need for anything from the trades to medical school,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to find creative solutions to bring those opportunities to high school students so they can actually obtain the prerequisites they need to get into specialized post secondary institutions.\u201d </p><p>Bird wants to review and revise the Province\u2019s forestry policies while consulting stakeholders such as Canfor, Carrier Lumber, Dunkley Lumber, and First Nations, among others.. </p><p>\u201cI think the forestry industry can be revitalized, but it\u2019s going to take some creativity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to start looking at the forest as more than just trees and see what we\u2019re taking out of that ecosystem as a whole. It\u2019s not just about timber products \u2013 it\u2019s about wildlife, backcountry tourism, fishing, forest fire management, all of those things. We need to make sure that resource is going to be sustainable, productive and economic for generations to come.\u201d </p><p>Bird says climate change can\u2019t be addressed with a one-size-fits-all solution, and the varying needs of different communities need to be taken into account while making policy decisions. </p><p>\u201cAs far as looking at how we as a province and as communities are going to reduce climate change, we need to be willing to have a variety of options,\u201d she said. \u201cthis is an extremely diverse province in regards to geography and environmental conditions, and we need to be realistic on that.\u201d </p><p>She also applies this line of thinking to industry regulations. </p><p>\u201cWe need to make sure that for whatever industry, whether it\u2019s mining, forestry, or oil and gas, there are rules and regulations in place to make sure the beauty of our province remains intact while remaining economically viable.\u201d </p><p>Bird supports the Conservatives\u2019 advocacy to eliminate the carbon tax, a move she believes would help small businesses by lowering operating costs. She\u2019d also like the provincial government to work in tandem with regional districts and municipal governments to develop permit and zoning bylaws that complement the community plans developed by local governments. </p><p>Conservative leader John Rustad is hoping to make the Conservatives into a big tent party, Bird said, which she hopes will appeal to would-be BC United supporters.  She points to the Conservatives\u2019 dissatisfaction with the NDP policies on mental health care and addiction as a point of common ground with BC United. </p><p>\u201cI think the decision for the [BC United] party to fold and for us to accept some of their candidates benefits all B.C. residents,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re comparing different policies from the two parties and saying, \u2018How do we find the best solution moving forward?\u2019 We\u2019re gathering and accepting more information.\u201d </p><p>Bird says she will be making several visits to the Robson Valley throughout the election period, and wants to talk with voters about their concerns. </p><p>\u201cCommunication, relationships, and transparent, accountable and honest governance are all very important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI would encourage anyone with concerns and feedback, positive or negative, to reach out. This is supposed to be collaborative governance, and we need to bring that back.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ebc0abf87e3e48f8a3e6b8b534ba0642</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D2M-JCK1-JBVR-34WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1058\"/><timeReceived>01:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 27, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

So that's why we have the fire ban in place.

Almost two-thirds of the burned area is in British Columbia.</p><p>Comparatively, fire activity in 2024 is a fraction of what happened during the worst fire season on record last year. By this time in 2023, nearly 2,500 fires had burned more than 46,000 square kilometres of land.

R. Martin, but alas, it is not. Instead, the moniker belongs to an upcoming art exhibition by Yukonbased artist Nicole Bauberger. Set to be displayed at Whitehorse\u2019s Northern Front Studio from Jan. 2 to 26, \u201cFish and Fire\u201d features several installations crafted from repurposed bicycle reflectors, glass and other materials. </p><p>As the exhibition\u2019s title implies, guests to Northern Front Studio can view Bauberger\u2019s bike reflector fish and a central piece that utilizes white and orange reflectors to abstractly recreate the likeness of a forest fire, among other installations. The inception of \u201cFire and Fish\u201d was in 2022, when Bauberger\u2019s partner, who runs a local bike shop, noted that too many bike reflectors are shipped with new bikes. He asked her if there was anything she could use them for, and she asked him to start collecting them for her. She ultimately decided to start making fish from the reflectors, an idea she credits in part to Nakai Theatre, who commissioned her and other artists in the spring of 2022 to create fish puppets to use in parades. \u201cYou know, a big thing of orange bike reflectors is beautiful. Like there\u2019s something that\u2019s really beautiful about it, and its beauty reminded me \u2014 kind of \u2014 of goldfish. And if you look at bike reflectors, they already have sort of a scaly pattern on them,\u201d Bauberger told the News. The reflector fish are small and, according to Bauberger, relatively quick to produce. Each fish\u2019s body is made with a trapezoid-shaped bike tire reflector, while the fins are made from clear tape. Bauberger\u2019s forest fire of reflectors is variously described by the artist as a \u201ckind of a painting, kind of a sculpture, and kind of a textile.\u201d It\u2019s made of white and orange bicycle reflectors and stands roughly six feet tall, with a width of about 40 inches. \u201cI took a bunch of the bike reflectors, and if you imagine, drilling holes at the top and the bottom of the two sides, then tying them together in a kind of a grid. They come in white and orange, and so I was working with the idea of it being a depiction of a fire,\u201d Bauberger said. \u201cOf course, the possibility of forest fire has been something that, you know, we\u2019re getting a little reprieve from thinking about it all the time right now because it\u2019s winter, but it was certainly something that was on all of our minds a lot this summer.\u201d Prior to the upcoming exhibition, Bauberger\u2019s fish were displayed at the Dalton Trail Gallery, an outdoor trail near her home in Hillcrest where Bauberger began installing work during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, where they were hung in the trees and danced in the wind. They were also incorporated into the event Theatre in the Bush, along with the bike reflector fire display. Speaking about what she hopes people take away from the exhibit, she says, \u201cPeople are invited to come to a show with their imaginations\u201d and that \u201cthe radical freedom of the audience to make their interpretation is one of the core values of art\u201d for her. That said, she notes that \u201cFish and Fire\u201d reflects some of her concerns about our \u201ccollective material culture\u201d and the waste it generates. Those interested can join Bauberger at Northern Front Studio for the exhibition\u2019s closing party on Jan. 26 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Contact Matthew Bossons at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:matthew.bossons@yukon-news.com\">matthew.bossons@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>News Reporter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20231229PTEA0004111043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B0D-7V71-F0HF-815C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

June and July of this year were the hottest months ever recorded in Greece, which also recorded its warmest winter ever.</p><p>Authorities were faced with \u201can exceptionally dangerous fire, which we have been fighting for more than 20 hours under dramatic circumstances,\u201d Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said mid-morning Monday. The fire was burning mainly on two separate fronts, with some parts in particularly difficult to reach areas on a mountain northeast of Athens, Kikilias said.</p><p>The fire department said 670 firefighters, backed by 27 teams specially trained to tackle wildfires and including more than 80 armed forces personnel, were battling the flames. More than 180 vehicles were deployed, while 17 water-dropping planes and 15 helicopters were providing aerial support.</p><p>A children\u2019s hospital, a military hospital, two monasteries and a children's home were evacuated early Monday, while evacuation orders, sent by push alerts to mobile phones starting Sunday and continuing throughout the night into Monday, were issued for more than a dozen areas, including Marathon and several Athens suburbs. Three Athens hospitals were put on heightened alert to treat any potential injuries.</p><p>Local media reported two firefighters were slightly injured, while several civilians were treated in hospitals for smoke inhalation. Several homes were burned, although the exact number was not immediately clear.</p><p>Greece's coast guard ordered all ferries going to and from the nearby port of Rafina, which serves mainly the Cycladic islands and Crete, to be diverted to the port of Lavrion due to the fire. </p><p>Authorities in nearby suburbs opened at least one sports hall and were providing rooms in hotels for evacuees, while yet more suburbs were put on standby for potential evacuation.</p><p>The police department said 380 police officers with 77 vehicles, 36 motorcycles, three buses and four vans were assisting in the evacuations, and by mid-morning had helped move more than 250 people away from the path of the flames. It posted a video on its social media channels showing police officers carrying elderly people in their arms out of houses and to waiting vehicles, against a backdrop of a night sky turned red from the flames and smoke.</p><p>The fire was burning in a wide arc on the capital's northeastern fringes, sending a blanket of smoke over central Athens on Sunday, darkening the sky. It began Sunday afternoon about 35 kilometers (22 miles) from Athens and was fanned by strong winds that quickly drove it out of control. Authorities said flames at times towered more than 25 meters (80 feet) in height.</p><p>Meteorologists and government officials have warned of the heightened danger of wildfires because of weather conditions from Sunday until Thursday, with half of the country placed under a \u201cred alert\u201d for wildfire hazard.</p><p>The fire department appealed to residents to follow evacuation orders issued by civil protection, with authorities noting that some people who had refused to leave their homes later became trapped and required rescuing, endangering the lives of firefighters.</p><p>\u201cDuring the night, the wind remained strong, creating dangerous situations,\u201d said Col. Vassileios Vathrakogiannis, the fire department\u2019s spokesman. \u201cUnfortunately their intensity is expected to increase in the coming hours,\" he added, appealing to residents to follow authorities' directions and evacuate when told to do so.</p><p>Wildfires are frequent in Greece during its hot, dry summers, but authorities have said climate change is fueling bigger and more frequent blazes. In 2018, a massive fire swept through the seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, trapping people in their homes and on roads as they tried to flee in their cars. More than 100 people died, including some who drowned trying to swim away from the flames.</p><p>Last year, wildfires in Greece killed more than 20 people, including 18 migrants who became trapped by the flames as they trekked through a forest in northeastern Greece and were caught by a massive fire that burned for more than two weeks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4d6a07dc7e0fa61d2e1bb2d6549f8974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPK-X7T1-JBVR-3023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><timeReceived>06:49 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 12, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The paper offered the opportunity for all three North Island candidates to be interviewed with the same questions. B.C. Conservative candidate Anna Kindy declined the interview and Green Party of B.C. candidate Nic Dedeluk\u2019s interview was featured in the Oct. 9 edition of the Mirror.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With a lack of public addiction treatment beds \u2013 only six in Campbell River to serve the North Island north of Nanaimo \u2013 what will your party do to address the lack of capacity? So this a priority for us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You just have to look at our downtown core, and you can see that we have people that are really in need of some help. We did get the six medical detox. We are still working with the City of Campbell River to take a look at another facility up closer to Peterson that will be social detox and second-stage housing, but we are very happy to work with the Wei Wai Kai First Nation on the Tsakwa\u2019lutan Lodge project that is going to be looking at a full culturally safe treatment centre over there as there.</p><p>I\u2019m really excited to start heading engagements with the community about what our involuntary care looks like because we do know that we have people who have multiple challenges, whether it be synthetic opioid addictions, brain injuries, or mental health issues that are really struggling to take care of themselves and are not safe out in our community either. It\u2019s being preyed on by some pretty relentless criminals, so I\u2019m looking forward to that. I think we have made really great progress in Campbell River over the last four years, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to do that.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province, and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what goals will you aim to strive for in helping the province and Island hit those goals? That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re not only seeing forest fires but heat domes and other emergency weather events like floods coming at a rapid pace\u2014a lot faster than we thought they were going to. So we have taken a really good stand with our Clean BC, and we\u2019re actually watching carbon emissions go down five percent in the last little while. We have a way to go, but we are certainly on the right path.</p><p>I talk to people on Cortes about this all the time, and they are trying very hard to decrease their carbon footprint, but it\u2019s not something we can individually do. It\u2019s something we have to do as a society as a whole.</p><p>We are working with industry. We are looking at sustainable industry to be able to move our North Island forward in an economically way, so looking at all of those alternative energy projects, I think we are very well positioned for on the north end of Vancouver Island.</p><p>While areas of the North Island are growing in rental housing, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock in the riding? We have heard John Rustad say he doesn\u2019t believe that the government should be involved in affordable housing, and we\u2019ve had some really good examples in Campbell River of making that happen. But we still struggle in our rural and remote communities just because it\u2019s so expensive to do that. I believe the government needs to be at the table to help move forward with affordable housing, and we also need to make sure that we\u2019ve got our developers feeling that they are supported enough that they can do that. So he (Eby) is committed to 300,000 homes over the next 10 years, and that\u2019s not just in the bigger centres, that\u2019s all over British Columbia and our rural and remote communities need it just as much as our urban and metropolitan areas as well.</p><p>School divisions in the North Island have policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit the school division\u2019s abilities to use these policies and resources? Absolutely not. I believe that inclusion and diversity in our school systems is absolutely one of the most important.</p><p>Right now, we just watched Mr. Eby talk about enhancing our school systems by hiring 5700 new teachers into the province, making sure every school has a mental health officer, and making sure every K (kindergarten) to Grade 3 classroom has a dedicated EA (education assistant) inside of it. We have also committed to 10,000 new before and aftercare child care spaces, which is fantastic.</p><p>You know, these are our kids and these are kids who are going to be our future, so we need to make sure we set them up on their learning path in a successful way, and we are doing that by investing in infrastructure. We have 125 new builds or builds that are almost completed in this province. When Mr. Rustad was there, he cut all those budgets and currently just said he is going to increase class sizes by 20 per cent. We\u2019re going to see that in Surrey first but teachers, EAs, and administrators in our public school systems have been bargaining and fighting for classroom and composition size for years. I think it goes back to the 1970s, and they are finally in a position where that can happen, and we are finally in a position where we are going to see the lowest class sizes in a very long time, and he\u2019s going to reverse that and he\u2019s going to gut that system. I am very concerned about it.</p><p>The resource industry is very important in Campbell River and the North Island. What will the BC NDP do to help ensure job security in this sector? It\u2019s no surprise to anybody that we are going through a transition in forestry, and we are doing that in collaboration with our rural, remote and Indigenous communities to make sure that everybody is on board.</p><p>We watched Mr. Rustad tank 30,000 forestry jobs under his leadership, and 20 mills in B.C. went down with absolutely no support for those communities, no support for those workers, no support for the Made in BC brand, and no support for communities and they lost millions of dollars in their tax base.</p><p>We have the job manufacturing plan that we have been putting money back in to make sure those forestry workers have good, meaningful jobs while we\u2019re going through this transition. But at the end of the day, we want to grow a forestry industry that our kids and grandkids can actually work in. If we don\u2019t do it correctly in a sustainable way, then we are going to end up losing it. I am very happy that we are doing this, yes, I know that it\u2019s hard on people, and I know that we are having trouble getting fibre out of the bush, but we just saw the BC NDP platform committing to take a look at stumpage because I know that has been an issue, taking a look at getting the permits out faster, which I know has been an issue and also to take a look at BC TS which is the BC timber sales that help get those going. I\u2019ve heard that, we\u2019ve listened to anywhere from the Truck Loggers Association to Western Forest Products, to communities in between, and we are starting to come out the other side, and I was really happy to see that reflected in the platform.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPRIV-news20241016PPPA0004647720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPRIV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D6H-XHX1-F0HF-8412-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1198\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>The city's most recent report shows 82,000 speeding tickets were issued through the ASE program between July 5, 2021 and March 31, 2024.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8</p><p>\\x95

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>The city's most recent report shows 82,000 speeding tickets were issued through the ASE program between July 5, 2021 and March 31,

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>The city's most recent report shows 82,000 speeding tickets were issued through the ASE program between July 5, 2021 and March 31,

Now we\u2019re under-standing that positive thinking is triggered by environments that make it possible for us to believe in ourselves, so we\u2019ve got the balance of the two,\u201d said Ungar after his presentation on nurturing young people\u2019s capacity to cope with extreme adversity at the Transforming Practices:Breaking Silence conference held at Gary W. Harris Canada Games on Tuesday.</p><p>He said a child\u2019s environments, like school, home, and community, should provide opportunities for them to feel powerful, access supportive relationships, show their talents and feel connected. They need a sense of control over their lives, just like community residents who have been evacuated due to a wildfire.</p><p>\u201cWe know to recover from a forest fire that getting your insurance claims settled very quickly is as, or more important, than seeing a psychologist. Most people need a banker, an insurance adjuster and a builder. These are going to be just as important in terms of cushioning them against a trauma of a displacement,\u201d said Ungar, who is also the Canada Research Chair in Child, Family and Community Resilience.</p><p>The Central Alberta Child Advocacy Centre and Red Deer Polytechnic teamed up to host the two-day conference.</p><p>Advocacy centre CEO Mark Jones said he is aware of the struggles front-line workers face on a daily basis and sharing best practices is important to assist clients as well as staff.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for coming here to be a part of this. We need to rally around each other and support each other to do the work and be the collective because as a collective we are so powerful,\u201d Jones said.</p><p>The conference continues Wednesday at RDP.

Vince Rutter, owner of Rutter Urban Forestry, said Thunder Bay sits in the middle of a forest and climate change is causing forests to react differently. \"Forest fires are a higher risk,\" he said. </p><p>\"Spruce budworm is here and will annihilate hundreds of thousands of balsam fir trees over the next three years, which will make forest fire conditions more intense and we don't have a plan or good economic solutions to deal with that. Biomass for energy is a big part of how we solve that. But we're behind on making that accessible immediately.\" Biomass is a forest byproduct of renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. Rutter says more than half of what comes out of the forest during harvests is low-grade, low-value fibre made up of bark, chips, tree tops and limbs. He said if it isn't used, it's left on the landscape to turn back into carbon, creating forest-fire problems. \"We're burning natural gas to make electricity to heat our buildings when we could be using that low value, easily accessible, low-cost fibre instead,\" he said, adding there isn't an economic driver to convert buildings from natural gas to biomass heat. Although it's done for heat pumps, he said those pumps are problematic for large-scale use. \"We need to look for solutions to build smaller-scale heating plants in our city and in the region,\" Rutter said. \"While we look to governments to make the economic situation more favourable to develop them, we can look to local companies that can design and build wood heating systems and companies like logging contractors that can produce heating fuel (biomass) for smaller plants.\" He pointed out that the fibre supply exists along with the contractors to deliver it and everything is in place already to move forward, but the economic triggers need some adjustment to increase viability. Rutter noted that Thunder Bay is unique in Ontario to spearhead these projects because of its strong forest sector. His company, which removes trees and generates a great quantity of woodchips, provides that woodchip biomass to Confederation College, which is used to heat the Shuniah building. Rutter was the recipient of $245,000 in provincial funding earlier this year to support his renewable energy production and deliver clean and cost-efficient heat generation with the purchase of a mobile forest biomass chipper and tractor to produce heating chips. Rutter said the importing of fossil fuels for energy from outside of Ontario needs to stop and Thunder Bay needs to start producing its own energy here. \"That means solar and wind and more biomass for heating and electricity generation,\" he said. \"I see a full conversion to biomass energy over the next 50 years. Over the next five years, I see some small but significant successes and those would be an eye-opener to the rest of us.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ac2909f81c4642d98dfb8c78423ad308</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BBN-8XW1-DY9S-T1DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><timeReceived>12:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 15, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In those days, the activities for youth were a-plenty, he said. He was even able to attend the long-running Camp Sunrise in Gibsons.</p><p>\u201cThat was the first holiday I ever had,\u201d he said, and kicked off a lifetime of travelling around Canada to serve with the Salvation Army. In fact, he was travelling on a train as an officer in the 1960s when he met Margaret, a fellow Salvation Army officer. He lived in Chilliwack and she lived in Kelowna, so they struck up a relationship writing letters to each other.</p><p>\u201cMy brother says I was struck right from the get-go,\u201d he said, of his love for her.</p><p>It took some time for the rest of the Bailey family to start going to church with the two boys.</p><p>\u201cOther people picked us up and took us there,\u201d he said, even though the family lived about 10 kilometres from the church.</p><p>He felt a calling to the church and to God from very early on, he explains, and his lifelong work with the Salvation Army has been the perfect way to serve.</p><p>\u201cI always felt that God wanted me and he wanted me to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be happy doing it in any other place, in any other way.</p><p>He and Margaret have been doing the work together for the last 40 years. Now that he\u2019s re-tired, he will sometimes preach at church. But he sees his role now as providing support to the people doing the front-line work, and encouraging them. He also likes supporting young people as they come into the church, as he felt so cared for as a child and teenager himself.</p><p>As a Christian, he adds, that the \u201cchuch is the genesis of all that we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly do feel hopeful,\u201d he adds. \u201cI believe that with the right support, the future should look even better. I think young people are better and more spiritually equipped than I was at that age.\u201d</p><p>His sentiments are echoed by other long-time volunteers that have served Chilliwack through the decades, includ-ing Joan Friesen.</p><p>She was \u201cborn into\u201d the church, with her family having a long history of service that goes back to the 1920s. Her grandfather, Wesly Cartmell, heard the Salvation Army band playing during an outside meeting. That was all he needed to join the Salvation Army. Her parents followed suit, with her dad playing trombone in the band. Her mother, Doris Cartmell, was part of the League of Mercy, visiting people in nursing homes.</p><p>Joan was dedicated as an infant in 1960 in the Salvation Army.</p><p>\u201cAs a child, I remember standing beside my dad at Remembrance Day services as well as Christmas carolling on street corners,\u201d she said. \u201cMy favourite times were going with my dad and brother, Ron to the Easter Sunrise services at Chilliwack Cemeteries when the sun was just starting to rise over Mt. Cheam.\u201d</p><p>She has worked in nearly every ministry within the church, including as a Young People Sargent Major, as leader of the Worship Team, and even on the Emergency Disasters Service food truck.</p><p>\u201cWhether we are at the Burns Bog near Delta feeding firefighters, or in Kamloops serving fire disaster refugees or at Merritt, feeding the flood victims, it is a joy for me to serve on behalf of the Salvation Army,\u201d she said. \u201cI see tears, smiles and appreciation of the recipients. I trust that people will see my Christian faith in action as well as a person who genuinely cares for them.\u201d</p><p>And most people in the community will have heard the names Don and Brenda Armstrong. The couple has been heavily involved in the Chilliwack Salvation Army, with Don often serving as the spokesperson for the organization.</p><p>He was \u201cborn and raised in the Salvation Army\u201d Don said, and the same goes for Brenda. They moved here in 1984 and he started as a truck driver for the church, and she started working in the thrift store.</p><p>\u201cThe focus of The Salvation Army is to show the love of Christ to others, especially those in need,\u201d Don said. \u201cSoup, Soap and Salvation was one of the older mottos and I believe we still meet that need.\u201d</p><p>He is currently the Food Bank and Emergency Disaster Services Co-Ordinator, while Brenda, who has been the Family Service Co-Ordinator, is now in the beginning of retirement.</p><p>\u201cWe both feel that working for The Salvation Army is a ministry and an honour where we can show the love of Christ through actively meeting the needs of others in our community,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cOne of my best memories is getting calls at two or three in the morning from the fire department to feed the fireman working either a home fire or forest fire,\u201d he added. \u201cBeing able to bring a warm meal and a cup of coffee to first responders and feeling I\u2019m making a small difference in the community. Working behind the scenes, hopefully showing you care, warms my heart and soul.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20240913PPUA0004592523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CYG-WHT1-JD2C-J1F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

The United States also had air quality advisories for smoke from fires burning in Canada that drifted across the border.</p><p>The document, a briefing note to the minister, singles out B.C. as one of the hardest-hit provinces. Tourism \u201csuffered immensely\u201d after two unprecedented fire events in the Okanagan and Mid-Island to Pacific Rim regions of B.C. , when fires caused, respectively, a travel ban and highway closure.</p><p>\u201cLast year is a year I was trying my best to forget,\u201d said Charles Mc-Diarmid, Maitre de Maison of the internationally renowned Wickaninnish Inn in Tofino, B.C. In June of last year, Highway 4, the only road connecting the towns of Port Alberni, Ucluelet and Tofino to the rest of Vancouver Island, was closed for more than two weeks due to a wildfire at Cameron Lake.</p><p>Hotel occupancy rates plummeted in the tourism economy-driven town from 83 per cent in June 2022, to just 48 per cent in June 2023, according to the report from ISED. The Wickaninnish Inn was expecting to be 73 per cent full that month, and ended up running at just over half capacity.</p><p>The effects of the road closure for the hotel carried into September \u2014 but for other tourism businesses, some of the impact is still being felt today, especially for adventure operators who McDiarmid says took the biggest hit during the highway closure.</p><p>A few days into the closure, a forest service road detour was established for supply delivery trucks and adventurous travelers \u2014 about a four hour drive from Lake Cowichan to Port Alberni.</p><p>But the damage for the season was already done, with many weddings and travel plans scrapped.</p><p>Businesses in the affected towns suffered. McDiarmid grew up in Tofino and has been an active part of the tourism industry in the town for 28 years.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a normal year since 2019,\u201d McDiarmid said. \u201cWe\u2019re just happy to have a normal year this year.\u201d</p><p>By September 2023, the combined area of burnt forest in Canada was larger than Greece and cost $3 billion, according to the report.</p><p>Last year, the Okanagan had travel restrictions issued in August. During that time, accommodation businesses were only permitted to host wildfire evacuees in the area. Okanagan businesses are still recovering from the financial loss during their busiest season, where hotel occupancy rates dropped eight percentage points in August compared to the previous year.</p><p>Businesses rely on the summer months to carry them through the rest of the year, says Vinil Sood, executive director of the North Okanagan Hotel Association and manager of the Quality Inn and Suites in Vernon, B.C. for the past 11 years.</p><p>\u201cI still remember it almost looked like an Armageddon over here, and it really had an impact on our community,\u201d Sood said.</p><p>\u201cWe have over a million people coming into Vernon every single year. Majority of them come in the summertime. So having all of the smoke and fires that are going on either around Vernon or around the Okanagan, or even in B.C. in general, it definitely deters people from entering our area.\u201d</p><p>Lower occupancy is driving margins down, too. Booking prices in 2024 are down 15 per cent from last year, says Sood, who also notes that vacationers are more hesitant to book in advance for fear of extreme weather disrupting their plans. Instead, travelers are booking just weeks in advance, making budgeting and planning more difficult for the industry.</p><p>This was echoed by McDiarmid and Walt Judas, CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of B.C. \u201cPeople have become accustomed to seeing wildfires over the years, and they\u2019re taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the advance bookings are quite soft in the Okanagan. People, in many respects, have chosen to go elsewhere rather than risk if there\u2019s going to be a fire,\u201d Judas said.</p><p>In the briefing note, ISED describes a letter sent to the Canada Revenue Agency in 2023 from national business and tourism associations seeking support for small business owners due to increased costs and revenue loss from last year\u2019s wildfires across the country. It says the government doesn\u2019t yet fully know the full effects of fires on the tourism industry.</p><p>McDiarmid is confident his small island town will make a complete recovery, and it is already well on the way.</p><p>\u201cTofino is a very resilient town. Our nickname isn\u2019t `tuff city\u2019 for nothing. And having grown up here we\u2019re pretty resilient, and we\u2019re used to dealing with occasional bouts of adversity and coming out the other end always positive,\u201d McDiarmid said.</p><p>\u201cLast year is a year I was trying my best to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u2013 Charles McDiarmid</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOFUWN-news20240828PTCA0004561085</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOFUWN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CV1-1R91-JD2C-J00Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438260</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

He lived in Chilliwack and she lived in Kelowna, so they struck up a relationship writing letters to each other.</p><p>\"My brother says I was struck right from the get-go,\" he said, of his love for her.</p><p>It took some time for the rest of the Bailey family to start going to church with the two boys.</p><p>\"Other people picked us up and took us there,\" he said, even though the family lived about 10 kilometres from the church.</p><p>He felt a calling to the church and to God from very early on, he explains, and his lifelong work with the Salvation Army has been the perfect way to serve.</p><p>\"I always felt that God wanted me and he wanted me to do this,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't be happy doing it in any other place, in any other way.</p><p>He and Margaret have been doing the work together for the last 40 years. Now that he's retired, he will sometimes preach at church. But he sees his role now as providing support to the people doing the front-line work, and encouraging them. He also likes supporting young people as they come into the church, as he felt so cared for as a child and teenager himself.</p><p>As a Christian, he adds, that the \"chuch is the genesis of all that we do.\"</p><p>\"I certainly do feel hopeful,\" he adds. \"I believe that with the right support, the future should look even better.\u00a0I think young people are better and more spiritually equipped than I was at that age.\"</p><p>His sentiments are echoed by other long-time volunteers that have served Chilliwack through the decades, including Joan Friesen.</p><p>She was \"born into\" the church, with her family having a long history of service that goes back to the 1920s. Her grandfather, Wesly Cartmell, heard the Salvation Army band playing during an outside meeting. That was all he needed to join the Salvation Army. Her parents followed suit, with her dad playing trombone in the band. Her mother, Doris Cartmell, was part of the League of Mercy,\u00a0visiting people in nursing homes.</p><p>Joan\u00a0was dedicated as an infant in 1960 in the Salvation Army.</p><p>\"As a child, I remember standing beside my dad at Remembrance Day services as well as Christmas carolling on street corners,\" she said. \"My favourite times were going with my dad and brother, Ron to the Easter Sunrise services at Chilliwack Cemeteries when the sun was just starting to rise over Mt.\u00a0Cheam.\"</p><p>She has worked in nearly every ministry within the church, including as a Young People Sargent Major, as leader of the Worship Team, and even on the Emergency Disasters Service food truck.</p><p>\"Whether we are at the Burns Bog near Delta feeding firefighters, or in Kamloops serving fire disaster refugees or at Merritt, feeding the flood victims, it is a joy for me to serve on behalf of the Salvation Army,\" she said.\u00a0\"I see tears, smiles and appreciation of the recipients. I trust that people will see my Christian faith in action as well as a person who genuinely cares for them.\"</p><p>And most people in the community will have heard the names Don and Brenda Armstrong. The couple has been heavily involved in the Chilliwack Salvation Army, with Don often serving as the spokesperson for the organization.</p><p>He was \"born and raised in the Salvation Army\" Don said, and the same goes for Brenda. They moved here in 1984 and he started as a truck driver for the church, and she started working in the thrift store.</p><p>\"The focus of The Salvation Army is to show the love of Christ to others, especially those in need,\" Don said. \"Soup, Soap and Salvation was one of the older mottos and I believe we still meet that need.\"</p><p>He is currently the Food Bank and Emergency Disaster Services Co-Ordinator, while Brenda, who has been the Family Service Co-Ordinator, is now in the beginning of retirement.</p><p>\"We both feel that working for The Salvation Army is a ministry and an honour where we can show the love of Christ through actively meeting the needs of others in our community,\" he added.</p><p>\"One of my best memories is getting calls at two or three in the morning from the fire department to feed the fireman working either a home fire or forest fire,\" he added. \"Being able to bring a warm meal and a cup of coffee to first responders and feeling I'm making a small difference in the community. Working behind the scenes, hopefully showing you care, warms my heart and soul.\"</p><p>Copyright 2024 Chilliwack Progress</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20240913PCL4643165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CYG-WHT1-JD2C-J18D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Hundreds of evacuees are now in the town of Happy Valley-Goose Bay. CBC's Kayla Hounsell is there with the latest developments.</p><p><br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:<br/>Just want to find out, and tell me to figure out what to do and where to go.<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>The Power's are looking for information about what comes next.<br/><br/>PAMELA POWER (EVACUEE FROM CHURCHILL FALLS):<br/>What about Bowing's?<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>They are among hundreds forced to flee their homes in Churchill Falls Wednesday. Their employer, Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro has set up here in Happy Valley-Goose Bay to help them make long-term plans because there is no end in sight.<br/><br/>SUSAN CHISLETT (EVACUEE FROM CHURCHILL FALLS):<br/>This is absolutely amazing. Our employers are making sure that we all know what's coming forward.<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>Churchill Falls is a true company town. It exists to power the massive hydroelectric plant that provides electricity to Newfoundland and Labrador and parts of Quebec.<br/><br/>GERARD DUNPHY (VP CHURCHILL FALLS AND MUSKRAT FALLS, NL HYDRO):<br/>We deal with many aspects of people's lives that are not normally addressed by an employer, and so it becomes much more of a, almost a family relationship. I've known many of these people for many, many years.<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>As for the fire, the most critical one is still burning within seven kilometres of Churchill Falls, but it has not grown and it is still on the other side of the Churchill River, a natural barrier protecting the town.<br/><br/>MARK LAWLOR (NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR FOREST FIRE DUTY OFFICER):<br/>We have no estimate of when the residents are going to be able to get back. The forecast four or five days out is, is for sunny weather.<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>In the meantime, the Power's are trying to enjoy the moment.<br/><br/>PAMELA POWER (EVACUEE FROM CHURCHILL FALLS):<br/>Thank you for answering the call because I was, I know all of few people, and you were the only one who replied. So.<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>They know they have it better than most.<br/><br/>NICOLE PARSONS (HAPPY VALLEY-GOOSE BAY RESIDENT):<br/>We take care of each other, so we take in random strangers. I've never met them before. That's what we do here in Labrador.<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>Yes, she invited random strangers into her home in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>PAMELA POWER (EVACUEE FROM CHURCHILL FALLS):<br/>There's some trust, right? Somebody who's going to be that vulnerable and take the risk of opening their home to let complete strangers in, you almost have to have the trust back, right?<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 1:<br/>Go, go, go!<br/><br/>KAYLA HOUNSELL (REPORTER):<br/>Trademark Newfoundland and Labrador hospitality, creating lifelong friendships at the most difficult of times.

This investment increases Nova Scotia's response capacity by buying and upgrading specialized firefighting equipment and training more personnel to support surge capacity needs. This investment will further enhance safety for communities and firefighters and improve wildfire resource sharing across Canada.</p><p>This funding also builds on last year's contribution of $169,292 to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) to deliver wildfire firefighter training to Indigenous participants from several Mi'kmaq communities throughout Nova Scotia. The contribution came from Natural Resource Canada's (NRCan) FMWCC   Training Fund,which provides support primarily to Indigenous communities and organizations to train firefighters and increase NRCan's understanding of the needs and barriers in this space. Staff from the CIFFC and the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and Renewables have delivered this training to 21 Mi'kmaw firefighters in 2023.</p><p>Through the RCF Program, Nova Scotia and NRCan will invest up to $3.9 million over five years aimed at preparing for wildfires, reducing risks before they occur and expanding the adoption of FireSmart principles and practices in Nova Scotia. With this funding, Nova Scotia will deliver educational and awareness activities related to wildfire prevention and community-based risk reduction. Nova Scotia is also using the funding to increase capacity to conduct wildfire risk assessments and develop tools to support wildfire prevention and mitigation. This initial investment is part of a series of joint investments aimed at supporting provincial and territorial efforts to advance FireSmart principles and practices to prevent wildfires and mitigate their impacts.</p><p>While reinforcing our country's ability to respond to wildfires when they occur is essential, proactive investment will also help reduce risks before a wildfire happens. The federal government has invested in both areas by supporting fire agencies across the country to better prepare for and respond to wildfires and by implementing community-level measures to prevent and reduce the impacts of wildfires.</p><p>Keeping Canadians safe and healthy is a top priority for the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia. By working with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities and international allies, the federal government continues to address and support the fight against wildfires to protect Canadian lives, as well as the health, safety, homes and livelihoods of our communities across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The Government of Canada is providing provinces, territories and partners with the support they need to address the challenges posed by wildfires. Today's announcement with the Government of Nova Scotia highlights our commitment to working together to mitigate and respond to wildfires through the FMWCC Program and the promotion of FireSmart Canada as a national program. Through tangible and fast-flowing funding, the Government of Canada is helping for future challenges and longer, more intense wildfire seasons.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Energy and Natural Resources</p><p>\"We had our worst wildfire season in recorded history last year, and we don't want to ever see that kind of devastation again. We know that wildfire is one of our top climate change risks, and we're taking action to both prevent and prepare for them. Through agreements with our federal partners, we're investing in equipment   including replacing our fleet of four helicopter water bombers   and we're stepping up our prevention measures to help keep our people and our communities safe.\"</p><p>The Honourable Tory Rushton Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables.</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> The FMWCC   Equipment Fund was launched in 2022 to proactively invest in and support provincial and territorial fire agencies' efforts in strengthening fire management capacities and capabilities across the country. By facilitating the purchase of firefighting equipment, such as fire crew trucks and personal protective equipment, the fund aims to increase capacity to respond to wildfires.Under Natural Resources Canada's FMWCC   Equipment Fund, provinces and territories must cost-share investments with the Government of Canada for equipment, such as vehicles, mobile units, avionics upgrades (parts), hoses, pumps and enhanced communications equipment, and for the repair of aging equipment and training.The FMWCC   Training Fund is providing $28 million over five years, starting in 2022 23, to train 1,000 firefighters and incorporate traditional knowledge in fire management. The fund includes a two-year Wildfire Training Pilot that ended in 2023 24 valued at $8.2 million, resulting in a total of 10 projects that mainly supported Indigenous organizations and communities. Over the next three years, starting in 2024 25, the Wildfire Training Fund has $16.8 million available to support successful applicants under the Call for Applications, which ended in February 2024.FireSmart Canada, a national program within the CIFFC, empowers Canadians to increase neighborhood resilience to wildfires and minimize their negative impacts. It offers resources, programs and recommendations designed to help individuals, landscape planners, forest managers and others protect homes and communities from wildfires.Visit Canada.ca/wildfires for a complete list of links to various federal supports for individuals impacted by wildfires.</p><p>Related products</p><p> The FMWCC   Equipment Fund was launched in 2022 to proactively invest in and support provincial and territorial fire agencies' efforts in strengthening fire management capacities and capabilities across the country.

In those days, the activities for youth were a-plenty, he said. He was even able to attend\u00a0the long-running Camp Sunrise in Gibsons.</p><p>\"That was the first holiday I ever had,\" he said, and kicked off a lifetime of travelling around Canada to serve with the Salvation Army. In fact, he was travelling on a train\u00a0as an officer in the 1960s when he met Margaret, a fellow Salvation Army officer. He lived in Chilliwack and she lived in Kelowna, so they struck up a relationship writing letters to each other.</p><p>\"My brother says I was struck right from the get-go,\" he said, of his love for her.</p><p>It took some time for the rest of the Bailey family to start going to church with the two boys.</p><p>\"Other people picked us up and took us there,\" he said, even though the family lived about 10 kilometres from the church.</p><p>He felt a calling to the church and to God from very early on, he explains, and his lifelong work with the Salvation Army has been the perfect way to serve.</p><p>\"I always felt that God wanted me and he wanted me to do this,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't be happy doing it in any other place, in any other way.</p><p>He and Margaret have been doing the work together for the last 40 years. Now that he's retired, he will sometimes preach at church. But he sees his role now as providing support to the people doing the front-line work, and encouraging them. He also likes supporting young people as they come into the church, as he felt so cared for as a child and teenager himself.</p><p>As a Christian, he adds, that the \"chuch is the genesis of all that we do.\"</p><p>\"I certainly do feel hopeful,\" he adds. \"I believe that with the right support, the future should look even better.\u00a0I think young people are better and more spiritually equipped than I was at that age.\"</p><p>His sentiments are echoed by other long-time volunteers that have served Chilliwack through the decades, including Joan Friesen.</p><p>She was \"born into\" the church, with her family having a long history of service that goes back to the 1920s. Her grandfather, Wesly Cartmell, heard the Salvation Army band playing during an outside meeting. That was all he needed to join the Salvation Army. Her parents followed suit, with her dad playing trombone in the band. Her mother, Doris Cartmell, was part of the League of Mercy,\u00a0visiting people in nursing homes.</p><p>Joan\u00a0was dedicated as an infant in 1960 in the Salvation Army.</p><p>\"As a child, I remember standing beside my dad at Remembrance Day services as well as Christmas carolling on street corners,\" she said. \"My favourite times were going with my dad and brother, Ron to the Easter Sunrise services at Chilliwack Cemeteries when the sun was just starting to rise over Mt.\u00a0Cheam.\"</p><p>She has worked in nearly every ministry within the church, including as a Young People Sargent Major, as leader of the Worship Team, and even on the Emergency Disasters Service food truck.</p><p>\"Whether we are at the Burns Bog near Delta feeding firefighters, or in Kamloops serving fire disaster refugees or at Merritt, feeding the flood victims, it is a joy for me to serve on behalf of the Salvation Army,\" she said.\u00a0\"I see tears, smiles and appreciation of the recipients. I trust that people will see my Christian faith in action as well as a person who genuinely cares for them.\"</p><p>And most people in the community will have heard the names Don and Brenda Armstrong. The couple has been heavily involved in the Chilliwack Salvation Army, with Don often serving as the spokesperson for the organization.</p><p>He was \"born and raised in the Salvation Army\" Don said, and the same goes for Brenda. They moved here in 1984 and he started as a truck driver for the church, and she started working in the thrift store.</p><p>\"The focus of The Salvation Army is to show the love of Christ to others, especially those in need,\" Don said. \"Soup, Soap and Salvation was one of the older mottos and I believe we still meet that need.\"</p><p>He is currently the Food Bank and Emergency Disaster Services Co-Ordinator, while Brenda, who has been the Family Service Co-Ordinator, is now in the beginning of retirement.</p><p>\"We both feel that working for The Salvation Army is a ministry and an honour where we can show the love of Christ through actively meeting the needs of others in our community,\" he added.</p><p>\"One of my best memories is getting calls at two or three in the morning from the fire department to feed the fireman working either a home fire or forest fire,\" he added. \"Being able to bring a warm meal and a cup of coffee to first responders and feeling I'm making a small difference in the community. Working behind the scenes, hopefully showing you care, warms my heart and soul.\"</p><p>Copyright 2024 Chilliwack Progress</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20240912PCL4643165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CYC-K451-JD2C-J53T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Federal officials said there was a response to try to douse the flames for about half the active fires.</p><p>About 1.3 million hectares have burned, which is close to the 10-year average for this time of year. By contrast, 1.3 million hectares had burned in B.C. alone by mid-July last year. Nationally by mid-July nearly 10 million hectares had already burned in 2023.</p><p>There are currently about 150 active wildfires across B.C. , a figure that\u2019s holding steady from Thursday following an eruption of wildfire activity this week.</p><p>An update posted by the BC Wildfire Service said a recent heat wave with little or no rain in many areas has left forests extremely dry and susceptible to new fires. It said temperatures had returned to more seasonable levels across the north, where rain was forecast for Saturday. But, it said, there was a risk of lightning in southern B.C. That heat wave extends into Alberta and Saskatchewan. Another prolonged stretch of hot, dry weather is expected to blanket much of the Prairies starting next week, raising the fire risk in those areas.</p><p>A wildfire near a stretch of the Manitoba-Saskatchewan boundary has prompted evacuation warnings in some communities.</p><p>People in Flin Flon, Man., and in Creighton and Denare Beach in Saskatchewan have been told to prepare emergency bags and be ready to leave on short notice.</p><p>The fire near Creighton is not contained, and town officials say on social media that a fresh-air centre is being set up for vulnerable people because of smoke.</p><p>Denare Beach says on its website there are concerns that people in the village may lose highway access and experience power outages.</p><p>Creighton municipal officials are asking people to conserve water, saying sprinklers have been set up for some town infrastructure as a precaution.</p><p>In northern Alberta, about 1,700 people were forced out of their homes earlier this week.

In those days, the activities for youth were a-plenty, he said. He was even able to attend\u00a0the long-running Camp Sunrise in Gibsons.</p><p>\"That was the first holiday I ever had,\" he said, and kicked off a lifetime of travelling around Canada to serve with the Salvation Army. In fact, he was travelling on a train\u00a0as an officer in the 1960s when he met Margaret, a fellow Salvation Army officer. He lived in Chilliwack and she lived in Kelowna, so they struck up a relationship writing letters to each other.</p><p>\"My brother says I was struck right from the get-go,\" he said, of his love for her.</p><p>It took some time for the rest of the Bailey family to start going to church with the two boys.</p><p>\"Other people picked us up and took us there,\" he said, even though the family lived about 10 kilometres from the church.</p><p>He felt a calling to the church and to God from very early on, he explains, and his lifelong work with the Salvation Army has been the perfect way to serve.</p><p>\"I always felt that God wanted me and he wanted me to do this,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't be happy doing it in any other place, in any other way.</p><p>He and Margaret have been doing the work together for the last 40 years. Now that he's retired, he will sometimes preach at church. But he sees his role now as providing support to the people doing the front-line work, and encouraging them. He also likes supporting young people as they come into the church, as he felt so cared for as a child and teenager himself.</p><p>As a Christian, he adds, that the \"chuch is the genesis of all that we do.\"</p><p>\"I certainly do feel hopeful,\" he adds. \"I believe that with the right support, the future should look even better.\u00a0I think young people are better and more spiritually equipped than I was at that age.\"</p><p>His sentiments are echoed by other long-time volunteers that have served Chilliwack through the decades, including Joan Friesen.</p><p>She was \"born into\" the church, with her family having a long history of service that goes back to the 1920s. Her grandfather, Wesly Cartmell, heard the Salvation Army band playing during an outside meeting. That was all he needed to join the Salvation Army. Her parents followed suit, with her dad playing trombone in the band. Her mother, Doris Cartmell, was part of the League of Mercy,\u00a0visiting people in nursing homes.</p><p>Joan\u00a0was dedicated as an infant in 1960 in the Salvation Army.</p><p>\"As a child, I remember standing beside my dad at Remembrance Day services as well as Christmas carolling on street corners,\" she said. \"My favourite times were going with my dad and brother, Ron to the Easter Sunrise services at Chilliwack Cemeteries when the sun was just starting to rise over Mt.\u00a0Cheam.\"</p><p>She has worked in nearly every ministry within the church, including as a Young People Sargent Major, as leader of the Worship Team, and even on the Emergency Disasters Service food truck.</p><p>\"Whether we are at the Burns Bog near Delta feeding firefighters, or in Kamloops serving fire disaster refugees or at Merritt, feeding the flood victims, it is a joy for me to serve on behalf of the Salvation Army,\" she said.\u00a0\"I see tears, smiles and appreciation of the recipients. I trust that people will see my Christian faith in action as well as a person who genuinely cares for them.\"</p><p>And most people in the community will have heard the names Don and Brenda Armstrong. The couple has been heavily involved in the Chilliwack Salvation Army, with Don often serving as the spokesperson for the organization.</p><p>He was \"born and raised in the Salvation Army\" Don said, and the same goes for Brenda. They moved here in 1984 and he started as a truck driver for the church, and she started working in the thrift store.</p><p>\"The focus of The Salvation Army is to show the love of Christ to others, especially those in need,\" Don said. \"Soup, Soap and Salvation was one of the older mottos and I believe we still meet that need.\"</p><p>He is currently the Food Bank and Emergency Disaster Services Co-Ordinator, while Brenda, who has been the Family Service Co-Ordinator, is now in the beginning of retirement.</p><p>\"We both feel that working for The Salvation Army is a ministry and an honour where we can show the love of Christ through actively meeting the needs of others in our community,\" he added.</p><p>\"One of my best memories is getting calls at two or three in the morning from the fire department to feed the fireman working either a home fire or forest fire,\" he added. \"Being able to bring a warm meal and a cup of coffee to first responders and feeling I'm making a small difference in the community. Working behind the scenes, hopefully showing you care, warms my heart and soul.\"</p><p>Copyright 2024 Chilliwack Progress</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLPRO-news20240911PCL4643165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLPRO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CY2-Y3S1-F0HF-803J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

The Company is pleased to report that there were no injuries to staff related to the fires, no damage to producing infrastructure and that production has resumed at all but one of the affected facilities. The Laprise Creek plant in NEBC, with net production of approximately 11,000 boepd, is currently in an evacuation zone and remains shut in. The Company is expecting to re-establish access during the next week. Tourmaline estimates that the overall net impact to Q2 2023 production from the wildfire events is in the 1.5-2.0% range. Reader Advisories</p><p>Currency</p><p>All amounts in this news release are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This news release contains forward-looking information and statements (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of any of the words \"forecast\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"objective\", \"ongoing\", \"on track\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"believe\", \"plans\", \"intends\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking information. More particularly and without limitation, this news release contains forward-looking information concerning the future payment of dividends and the timing and amount thereof which assumes the availability of free cash flow to fund such dividends and the estimated net impact to Q2 2023 productionof the fire related production disruptions. The forward-looking information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Tourmaline, including expectations and assumptions concerning the following: prevailing and future commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve volumes; operating costs, the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the benefits to be derived from acquisitions; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; ability to maintain its investment grade credit rating; and ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully. Without limitation of the foregoing, future dividend payments, if any, and the level thereof is uncertain, as the Company's dividend policy and the funds available for the payment of dividends from time to time is dependent upon, among other things, free cash flow, financial requirements for the Company's operations and the execution of its growth strategy, fluctuations in working capital and the timing and amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other factors beyond the Company's control. Further, the ability of Tourmaline to pay dividends will be subject to applicable laws (including the satisfaction of the solvency test contained in applicable corporate legislation) and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing its indebtedness, including its credit facility.</p><p>Although Tourmaline believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Tourmaline can give no assurances that it will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature it involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, production, revenues, costs and expenses; health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations; interest rate fluctuations; marketing and transportation; loss of markets; environmental risks; competition; incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions; failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions; ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources;uncertainties associated with counterparty credit risk; failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; climate change risks; inflation; supply chain risks; the impact of wars (including the war in Ukraine), hostilities, civil insurrections, pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease in Canada or worldwide; and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties and environmental regulations. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.</p><p>Additional information on these and other factors that could affect Tourmaline, or its operations or financial results, are included in the Company's most recently filed Management's Discussion and Analysis (See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" therein), Annual Information Form (See \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>) or Tourmaline's website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tourmalineoil.com\">www.tourmalineoil.com</url>).</p><p>The forward-looking information contained in this news release is made as of the date hereof and Tourmaline undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless expressly required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>About Tourmaline Oil Corp.</p><p>Tourmaline is Canada's largest and most active natural gas producer dedicated to producing the lowest-emission and lowest-cost natural gas in North America.

She didn\u2019t want any stops even as we drove by beautiful and touristy Mt. Robson.</p><p>The Welcome to Alberta sign finally came into our sight and she didn\u2019t need to get out and stand beside it.</p><p>This excited seven-year-old snapped a great photo as we drove by and on into our neighbouring province.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t only eat Mc-Donalds. I had waited to shop until I could find out what she would like to eat.</p><p>At Hinton the food prices were good and gas was low at 145.9. In Edmonton, I saw gas prices as low as 138.9 per litre.</p><p>Leaving a five-day family reunion full of cousins and aunts and uncles brought on real tears but West Edmonton Mall soothed her as she had heard all about it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t disappoint with something for everyone. Layla chose a sea lion performance and bumper cars with her papa.</p><p>Choosing just two attractions left us more time and we were off to Drumheller which proved true that a seven-year-old would love dinosaurs.</p><p>As close to opening as possible is the time to take in this exhibit. Some days there can be 6,000 people who go through, but they were coming in as we were going out.)</p><p>Google Maps is a great help and in the hands of the enthusiast beside me, I had the best navigator possible. Kids can tech! She cheered me on, \u201cGG you levelled out, 17 km to go in 17 min.\u201d</p><p>I wish I had brought a fold-up map. She was fresh out of Grade two and loved to read.</p><p>From Drumheller we went to Canmore. The next day we drove on up through Banff, Lake Louise and the Columbia Ice Fields.</p><p>We drove through the mountains early while it was cool as my motorhome has a small radiator. It was a little daunting with very little traffic and a very large highway sign that said \u2018no cell service for 238 km.\u2019</p><p>With relief, I remembered my Zoleo which picks up satellites and I can text with it as my hub.</p><p>We saw a grizzly, a black bear and a squirrel. By mid-day, the highway was pretty busy.</p><p>Layla observed, \u2018why does it say welcome to BC, we live here?\u2019 Onward, right into the town of Jasper for ice cream.</p><p>This round trip from Jasper can be done in a week and is fairly easy on the budget. We drove through the badlands of Alberta and its oil fields and saw six crossings for wildlife over Hwy 93 \u2013 which we thought was a very kind thing to have for both humans and wild animals.</p><p>There were a few sad tears from Layla , on that last day as we woke up in Canmore and drove back to Prince George.</p><p>And a few sad tears from me as she said, \u201cGG I wish this was the first day.\u201d</p><p>If you have items for this community column please call Sonja Lester 250-847-4414 or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sonja.lester.b.c@gmail.com\">sonja.lester.b.c@gmail.com</email></p><p>VALLEY CONNECTIONS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-news20240711PQLA0004486012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CFV-SHR1-F0HF-80D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

A further 25 homes in the same electoral area are under evacuation alert.</p><p>The Cook\u2019s Ferry Indian Band has issued an evacuation order for Reserves 5, 6, 8A, 19 Firstly and 22. Reserves 5A, 8, 9, 11, 11A, 18 and 20 are further under an evacuation alert. The band hasn\u2019t specified how many homes the orders cover.</p><p>\u201cThis wildfire has proven to be extremely volatile,\u201d Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness Bowinn Ma said Thursday (July 18) while providing an update on the situation.</p><p>No structures have been impacted so far in the area, as far as the B.C. Wildfire Service knows, but it said they are threatened.</p><p>Forest fuels in the area and across B.C. are at an especially high risk of ignition right now as hot, dry conditions persist.</p><p>As of Thursday morning, 25 regions remain under a heat alert, stretching from Whistler in the southwest to the north and central coasts and deep into the Interior. Environment Canada says the above normal temperatures will persist into the weekend for coastal regions and into next week for the Interior.</p><p>Cliff Chapman, director, provincial opera-tions of the B.C. Wildfire Service, said forecasts call for seven days of above-average temperatures across the southern two-thirds of B.C. with highs hitting the mid-30s and approaching the low 40s. These higher temperatures will also come with strong winds, he added.</p><p>\u201cI will be real clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on the precipice on a very challenging 72 hours. We saw lightning came through yesterday. That\u2019s now being replaced with 30-plus-degree-weather over the course of the next 24 hours and we anticipate more significant lightning in the northern half of the province today as well as the potential of lightning across British Columbia tomorrow with localized convective activity.\u201d</p><p>One measure of the growing concern among officials is the pending arrival of wildfire incident management teams from Australia and New Zealand, which are expected to arrive last week.</p><p>Chapman added that Yukon and Alaska are also sending one air tanker each. And, a 20-person crew from Nova Scotia came in last weekend to help fight fires, while two firefighting aircraft from Ontario have landed and will be stationed in Williams Lake.</p><p>Chapman noted that they are also engaging much more closely this year with communities and their local firefighting resources.</p><p>\u201cSo essentially we have stood up our preparedness across the province with multiple resources in every zone in anticipation of lightning or non-lightning fires starting, so we can have aggressive initial attacks on those fires.\u201d</p><p>Chapman said the likelihood of B.C. calling in even more out-of-province resources is \u201cmoderate-to-high,\u201d but noted that resources across North America (and the world at large) are limited.</p><p>\u201cSo we need to be proactive in what we are looking for, make sure that we have the resource arrive on time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do have an ask in already for additional ground firefighting crews to support our own staff, the contracted crews and the community fire-fighters that we currently have engaged and there has been no answer to that request at this point from the (Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre).\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOUTOD-news20240724PQKA0004506008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOUTOD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CJM-C8S1-JD2C-J3K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438225</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Some bases have hired more than their allocated crews, while others only have a third of their usual numbers.</p><p>Crews are deployed where they are needed\u00a0</p><p>Smith says \"crews are deployed across Ontario as provincial resources during the fire season to where they are needed.\"\u00a0</p><p>In other words, if a fire breaks out in the Greenstone area and there aren't enough available crews to tackle it, resources will be sent in from other bases.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Eric Davidson, president of the Ontario Professional Association of Wildland Firefighters, says there are a few downsides to this approach, including increased workloads for neighbouring bases.\u00a0</p><p>\"It just means there's a lot of movement of resources around the province, which puts a larger strain on everyone else,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>He says that when he started working as a firefighter ten years ago, he would expect one or two tours in other sectors throughout the season.</p><p>\"Now you're going to be a firefighter for the entire province all summer,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Options to secure additional resources</p><p>If the fire season turns out to be especially difficult, the province can also rely on 320 additional firefighting personnel sourced from private contractors - although they would not have the qualifications required to carry out initial fire attack work.\u00a0</p><p>Ontario could also turn to its mutual aid partnerships with national and international agencies to unlock more resources.\u00a0</p><p>Many provinces relied on those types of agreements to get through last year's record-breaking fire season.\u00a0</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), which co-ordinates resource allocation among provinces during fire seasons, says it ran out of domestic capacity in 2023 and had to look abroad for help.\u00a0</p><p/><p>\"The provinces and territories got to a point where they each needed the resources that they had, so sharing domestically was almost impossible,\" says communications officer Jennifer Kamau.\u00a0</p><p>She says the CIFFC ended up recruiting from 12 different countries to meet the needs of different provinces - including countries it had never before entered into\u00a0an agreement with, like South Korea.</p><p>\"There were a little over 7,000 personnel mobilized, and that's the most we've ever seen,\" said Kamau.\u00a0</p><p>She says it's hard to say whether they will eventually reach a point where there's a shortage of international personnel to draw from, as fire seasons vary from year to year, and from country to country.\u00a0</p><p>High turnover rate and 'watering down' experience levels</p><p>Smith confirms the province has hired 143 crew leaders this year. Ontario has historically aimed to have a total of 190 fire crews.</p><p>Fire crews\u00a0traditionally consist\u00a0of four people, including two members, one boss and one leader.\u00a0</p><p>Fire crew leaders typically have at least five years of experience under their belt and are tasked with overseeing the work of their crew and making decisions about how best to attack and suppress fires.\u00a0</p><p>But the high turnover rate among forest fire fighters in recent years means the pool of qualified candidates for fire crew leader positions gets smaller every year, according to Aviation Forest Fires and Emergency Services internal documents.</p><p>\"We're just watering down our experience every year that we can't keep people around,\" said Davidson.</p><p>A complicated recruitment effort\u00a0</p><p>On the ground, the relative scarcity of fire crew leaders means some crews are now composed of up to six people, as opposed to the traditional four person crew.\u00a0</p><p>It also complicates recruitment efforts, according to Davidson.\u00a0</p><p>\"People are potentially being turned away,\" he said. \"Someone who might be certified to be a crew leader can't get hired because they don't have enough [crew members].\"\u00a0</p><p>Davidson says the inverse can also happen - where there are enough crew members, but no crew leaders.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Donald Warren has six years of forest firefighting experience.

First of all, overall in the province we have increased the number of treatment beds by over 650, and some of them are within the region in Nanaimo, which is available to people from here. We do have a recovery centre here. That\u2019s a good example of when we took office, the whole system for recovery houses was unregulated and unsafe for so many people and we put in regulations and provided a lot more support so that the recovery houses have a better outcomes and also makes us able to retain the workers who are providing a service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We\u2019ve got outpatient services here, which is really important, and people on the ground in terms of Outreach. We have a situation table here in the Comox Valley which is an early intervention process to keep people from going down the criminal path and creating their issues more around their health issues and social issues, so that agencies can intervene and not see people turned down the criminal path. It frees up the police resources as well.</p><p>We have complex care housing that was fairly recently announced to have more beds for 400 beds, including in Nanaimo. That\u2019s for people with mental health and substance use issues. And of course most recently, there\u2019s been the announcement around Secure Care for those who are even further along the path and are a danger to themselves and to our communities.</p><p>I also want to add that the solution is not to criminalize people. That\u2019s an expensive road to go down as well. And it doesn\u2019t have good outcomes either for individuals or for our community.</p><p>There is now an opioid treatment access line that\u2019s available through throughout British Columbia to get people help where they are, when they need it.</p><p>Every year, temperature records are broken throughout the province and the forest fire season appears to be getting worse and longer. What does your party see as the best way for carbon reduction, and what are your climate goals and how will you aim to strive in helping the province and Island hit those goals? We\u2019ve been taking action right from the first day to fight pollution and take better care of the place that we love, and at the same time, we\u2019re working to build a clean economy with good paying jobs, local jobs and With the Greens in 2017 we began work to create the clean BC plan and that has created a pathway for us to drive down our greenhouse gases and we\u2019ve been working towards that including putting forward an accountability legislation that has us measuring and making sure that we are on the path to reach our targets. That accountability measure comes up every year. It\u2019s an annual report, so that we\u2019re always on our finger on the pulse about whether we\u2019re going in the right direction.</p><p>We put in emissions cap for the oil and gas industry along with ending the deep wells subsidy. We have a new energy framework to create more clean energy solutions like solar and wind.</p><p>I just want to say that Perfection is the enemy of progress.</p><p>And what we are faced with is the possibility of a government that doesn\u2019t even believe in climate change, and we need to do what we can to make sure that we can continue to move forward.</p><p>While there has been an increase in rental housing construction in the Comox Valley, there continues to be a lack of affordable housing. What detailed actions will your party take to increase affordable housing stock here? The whole issue around affordable housing is of course province-wide and we\u2019re pretty proud of the work that\u2019s been undertaken. I know that we have looked far and wide to find different innovative ways to create more affordable housing. We\u2019ve taken on a number of initiatives which are just starting to roll out and we\u2019ll be seeing the impacts.</p><p>I\u2019m sure pretty quickly around the small scale multi-unit approval so that more affordable housing can be built within our neighbourhoods, and so people can stay in the neighbourhoods that they grew up in or stay in them as they age and don\u2019t want to be in the bigger homes. We\u2019re facilitating faster approvals for modular housing. It was in an-nouncement up in Cumberland this past week.</p><p>There\u2019s a forty thousand dollar forgivable loan for people to build affordable rentals in secondary suites. We\u2019ve introduced the flipping tax to work to bring down housing prices. We\u2019ve curtailed short-term rentals and we have the speculation and vacancy tax. All those are making a difference.</p><p>Stats Can reports were the only Province to be having a rent reduction, rents are coming down. We\u2019re certainly not there yet and we have so much more to do. Rustad and the BC Conservatives intend to to scrap our affordable housing action plan and it didn\u2019t work before and it\u2019s only going to make things worse.</p><p>The area around the Connect Centre in Courtenay continues to face issues and there have been reported increases of crime in the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposed Braidwood Complex aims to address these issues, but has faced pushback from some neighbours. Do you agree with the Braidwood Complex and its location, and how will you aim to make it work effectively? If not, how will you address these issues in its absence? I think the first thing that I\u2019d like to say is that I applaud this community for trying to address the needs of people who are living without a home in our community. The connect centre was never a purpose-built building, and they\u2019ve done what they can. Is it enough? obviously not. The community needs to feel safe.</p><p>Some of the initiatives that we\u2019ve taken are to try to help address that, but in the end we need housing for people. Housing first along with the supports that can help them succeed. We have a really good example of the old Super 8 now called The Lodge where people moved from the street into housing and with the right supports, it\u2019s been a successful small community, which has not impacted the neighbourhood.</p><p>So do I support the proposed Braidwood complex? Absolutely. Do I recognize that the neighbor\u2019s are very worried about it? Absolutely.</p><p>I have been seeing how BC housing is working to respond to those concerns in the design of the whole complex. I think that that\u2019s really an important piece of this, that people recognize that everyone needs a home and that we can we can deliver safe housing and safe neighbourhood.</p><p>I know that I\u2019ve heard the Conservative candidate questioning it, and I would be really curious about how he\u2019ll answer this because I\u2019ve been looking at this since 2004. I\u2019ve been trying to find the right place and in the end it\u2019s about providing the right supports to make it successful wherever the land happens to be available.</p><p>School District 71 has policies and resources that create a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Will your government do anything to change or limit SD71\u2019s ability to use these policies and resources? The simple answer is no I wouldn\u2019t do anything to change your limit the ability to create a safe and dignified environment for our students. I think we have proven as a BC NDP government that support with creating the safe access around schools because of the protests that have been occurring around the province to make sure that the kids and the parents and the teachers and support staff are all safe and not bullied or harassed.</p><p>There\u2019s a misinformation campaign out there about what SOGI is. It is about creating a safe space for all students and giving them the dignity and respect that they all deserve.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20241009PPXA0004635265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D52-4FK1-F0HF-80CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1264\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

As we stowed her bags in my motorhome she let me know\u00a0her favorite food was McDonalds and that she had never crossed the BC/Alberta border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We spent the first night at a campsite and we could see that a forest fire had come far too close to the highway and the village of McBride.</p><p>In the morning Layla\u2019s excitement was high and her focus never wavered. She was crossing a border and I was in awe of her joy! She didn\u2019t want any stops even as we drove by beautiful and touristy Mt. Robson.</p><p>The Welcome to Alberta sign finally came into our sight and she didn\u2019t need to get out and stand beside it. This excited seven-year-old snapped a great photo as we drove by and on into our neighbouring province.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t only eat McDonalds.\u00a0I had waited to shop until I could find out what she would like to eat. At Hinton the food prices were good and gas was low at 145.9.\u00a0In Edmonton, I saw gas prices as low as 138.9 per litre.</p><p>Leaving a five-day family reunion full of cousins and aunts and uncles brought on real tears but West Edmonton Mall soothed her as she had heard all about it. It didn\u2019t disappoint with something for everyone. Layla chose a sea lion performance and bumper cars with her papa.</p><p>Choosing just two attractions left us more time and we were off to Drumheller which proved true that a seven-year-old would love dinosaurs.</p><p>As close to opening as possible is the time to take in this exhibit. Some days there can be 6,000 people who go through, but they were coming in as we were going out.)</p><p>Google Maps is a great help and in the hands of the enthusiast beside me, I had the best navigator possible.\u00a0 Kids can tech!\u00a0 She cheered me on, \u201cGG you levelled out, 17 km to go in 17 min.\u201d</p><p>I wish I had brought a fold-up map. She was fresh out of Grade two and loved to read.</p><p>From Drumheller we went to Canmore. The next day we drove on up through Banff, Lake Louise and the Columbia Ice Fields.</p><p>We drove through the mountains early while it was cool as my motorhome has a small radiator.\u00a0 It was a little daunting with very little traffic and a very large highway sign that said \u2018no cell service for 238 km.'\u00a0 With relief, I remembered my Zoleo which picks up satellites and I can text with it as my hub.</p><p>We saw a grizzly, a black bear and a squirrel. By mid-day, the highway was pretty busy.</p><p>Layla observed, 'why does it say welcome to BC, we live here?'\u00a0Onward, right\u00a0into the town of Jasper for ice cream.</p><p>This round trip from Jasper can be done in a week and is fairly easy on the budget. We drove through the badlands of Alberta and its oil fields and saw six crossings for wildlife over Hwy 93 \u2013 which we thought was a very kind thing to have for both humans and wild animals.</p><p>There were a few sad tears from Layla , on that last day\u00a0as we woke up in Canmore and drove back to Prince George. And a few sad tears from me as she said, \u201cGG I wish this was the first day.\u201d</p><p>If you have items for this community column please call Sonja Lester 250-847-4414 or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sonja.lester.b.c@gmail.com\">sonja.lester.b.c@gmail.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2024 Smithers Interior News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMTINW-news20240708PIN4619707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMTINW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CF6-TXW1-F0HF-805V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Power cuts were reported in several parts of the capital and also affected traffic lights at major junctions in the center.</p><p>The wildfire was racing through pine forests left tinder-dry by repeated heat waves this summer. June and July of this year were the hottest months ever recorded in Greece, which also recorded its warmest winter ever.</p><p>Authorities are faced with \"an exceptionally dangerous fire, which we have been fighting for more than 20 hours under dramatic circumstances,\" Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said mid-morning Monday. The fire was burning mainly on two separate fronts, with some parts in particularly difficult to reach areas on a mountain northeast of Athens, Kikilias said.</p><p>A children's hospital and a military hospital, two monasteries and a children's home were evacuated, while one more hospital was to be evacuated Monday afternoon. More than two dozen emergency push alerts were sent to cellphones in the area warning people to flee, while homes in several areas were burned, although the exact number was not immediately clear.</p><p>\"The wind would go in one direction and then in the other. The smoke was suffocating. You couldn't see. Your eyes teared up. You couldn't breathe. You couldn't see the house,\" said Spyros Gorilas, a resident of the area of Dioni who hosed down his house with water to save it from the flames. \"Even the helicopter that dropped water, you couldn't see it. You could only hear it. Nothing else.\"</p><p>Evacuation orders were issued throughout the day for yet more Athens suburbs as strong winds continued unabated. Fire Department spokesperson Col. Vassileios Vathrakogiannis said authorities had been faced with more than 40 flareups since the early hours of Monday in areas where the flames had somewhat abated.</p><p>The fire department said 685 firefighters, backed by 27 teams specially trained to tackle wildfires and including more than 80 armed forces personnel, were battling the flames. More than 190 vehicles were deployed, with aerial support from 17 water-dropping planes and 16 helicopters.</p><p>Three Athens hospitals were on heightened alert, while paramedics and ambulances treated two firefighters \u2014 one for light burns and the other for breathing problems \u2014 and 13 civilians for breathing problems, Vathrakogiannis said. The Athens Medical Association urged residents near affected areas to exercise caution, especially those with chronic conditions, the elderly, pregnant women, young children, and those with respiratory and heart problems.</p><p>Greece's coast guard diverted all ferries going to and from the nearby port of Rafina, which serves mainly the Cycladic islands and Crete, to the port of Lavrion due to the fire, while authorities were providing temporary shelter for evacuees in sports halls and hotels.</p><p>The police department said 380 police officers with 77 vehicles, 36 motorcycles, three buses and four vans were assisting in evacuations, and by mid-morning had helped move more than 250 people away from the path of the flames. It posted a video on its social media channels showing police officers carrying elderly people in their arms out of houses and to waiting vehicles, against a backdrop of a night sky turned red from the flames and smoke.</p><p>The fire department appealed to residents to follow evacuation orders, with authorities noting that some people who refused to leave their homes later became trapped and required rescuing, endangering the lives of firefighters.</p><p>Meteorologists and government officials have warned of the heightened danger of wildfires because of weather conditions from Sunday until Thursday, with half of the country placed under a \"red alert\" for wildfire hazard.</p><p>Wildfires are frequent in Greece during its hot, dry summers, but authorities have said climate change is fueling bigger and more frequent blazes. In 2018, a massive fire swept through the seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, trapping people in their homes and on roads as they tried to flee in their cars. More than 100 people died, including some who drowned trying to swim away from the flames.</p><p>Last year, wildfires in Greece killed more than 20 people, including 18 migrants who became trapped by the flames as they trekked through a forest in northeastern Greece and were caught by a massive fire that burned for more than two weeks.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20240812PAB4632330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPN-TC11-F0HF-837G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Group Ltd.

But Lawlor said that could change.</p><p>\"That fire is still out of control and is still capable of, given the right conditions, that fire could get up and really get going again.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big land with bigger heart</emphasis></p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey said in a press conference in\u00a0Happy Valley-Goose Bay on Sunday\u00a0that while that the fire has still not crossed the Churchill River toward\u00a0the town, crews are taking advantage of the reprieve.</p><p>\"We have also taken extra measures and are now creating a fire break around the community,\" said Furey.</p><p>\"That involves the use of heavy equipment to remove some trees and vegetation to eliminate potential fuel source if the fire does cross the river.\"</p><p>That fire break is 60 meters wide and 8-10 kilometers long, so it will take days to complete.</p><p>The premier also thanked both crews battling the fires and those who have stepped in to help the displaced residents of Churchill Falls in the town of Happy Valley-Goose Bay where about 100 of the initial 750 evacuees still remain.</p><p>\"Once again,\" said Furey, \"incredibly grateful for the people of Happy Valley-Goose Bay and in Labrador in general.

We wouldn't want to do this for years, obviously. But we can outlast this fire, and we will do what we need to make sure the plant remains safe to operate as well.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire ban still on</emphasis></p><p>As the fire could still change direction, no timeline has been set for a return to Churchill Falls.</p><p>Premier Furey said that the province has put charter flights in place to take evacuees to the island portion of the province, where many have family.\u00a0</p><p>But he reiterated to people across the province who might want to help out that the best way to do so is to obey the provincial ban on open fires.</p><p>\"We really can't spare any resources right now. And that is a way that you can help the people of Churchill Falls. So people are often asking 'how can we help?' 'What can we do?'\u00a0</p><p>\"That's something that you can do at home.

Marie (which boasts a wingspan of 18 feet and nine inches) was crafted by artist Jean-Philippe Morin out of Quebec. </p><p>The H-Boat exhibit at the bushplane museum, which includes an accompanying touchscreen display detailing the aircraft's history, was put together by curator Mary Collier. </p><p>The bushplane museum is also hosting a series of events this fall to celebrate the 100th anniversary of OPAS. </p><p>These events include a welcome reception (Sept. 18), an OPAS Discovery Day tour (Sept. 19, a live presentation by historian Dr. Robert Galway (Sept. 19) and a VIP meet and greet (Sept. 20). </p><p>Visit the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre's official website for more information. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kdarbyson@postmedia.com\">kdarbyson@postmedia.com</email></p><p>The Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f4b3f7b246d64ece88013030fe6942bb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8F-KJN1-JBVR-30KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><timeReceived>12:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 15, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
