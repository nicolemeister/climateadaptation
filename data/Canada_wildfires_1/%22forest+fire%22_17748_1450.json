The school has made good progress in Ashcroft for the past two years, and with a new and commodious school building the Ashcroft school will begin to take a high rank as an educational institution. It has been long in coming, but the people generally are well pleased to have as good a building as is now in the course of construction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kamloops Election:Next Tuesday Kamloops will have an election to see whether or not a loan of $37,500 shall be secured by the city to be used for light and water service. While there is not so much interest shown as would be expected by those interested, it is the general impression that the loan will be endorsed.</p><p>A Gentlemanly Match:Editor, Journal \u2014 Sir:I was always under the impression that colonials were no sportsmen, that they could not take a defeat; that their games were always conducted in a rowdy fashion, the umpire\u2019s decision invariably disputed, and the finale generally being a free fight and a dead umpire. Judge of my feelings of surprise, then, when last Saturday a baseball team from Ashcroft played our Lillooet team. The game all through was conducted in a most admirable and gentlemanly spirit on both sides, and though our excitement ran high, as it was a close game, I did not hear one word of bad language, and the umpire\u2019s decisions were unquestioned. I cannot refrain, therefore, from congratulating Ashcroft on their having a baseball team with whom it is a pleasure to play. Nor can I deny myself the pride I feel to be associated with a baseball team who, by the way they took their defeat, proved themselves to be true sportsmen and gentlemen. Yours faithfully, A Britisher.</p><p>Change Of Circumstances:Time brings about changes, sometimes very suddenly too. A man may be a good man at night, and ready and anxious to whip any other man in Ashcroft. The next morning, when he wakes up without a cent in his pocket and in the Skookum House for being drunk and disorderly, he is not nearly so big a man as he was the night before.</p><p>100 YEARS AGO:AUG. 9, 1924 Baseball; Cache Creek-Ashcroft:On Sunday last, four automobiles loaded to the mud guards with enthusiastic baseball players of the Spud City, visited the Coney Island of the Cariboo (Cache Creek), and after two hours of very strenuous combat with the diamond heroes of this famous sporting centre, emerged very muchly bedraggled winners by a score of 14 to seven. The game itself developed many exciting and interesting feature plays, particularly Ruckhaber\u2019s marathon stunt trying to locate the third base bag, and Manager Collins\u2019 gallant attempt to hold and snare a fly ball, whilst uncomfortably reposing upon an exceedingly large patch of cactus. The ball unfortunately got away, but the cactus stuck to Bert, but all in all it was a splendid effort. For this play Bert was credited with many \u201cpoints\u201d. However, with the aid of a claw hammer and a pair of pliers, Bert was fixed up, but it was noticed that he was very shy of \u201cpep\u201d for the rest of the game.</p><p>Lillooet:Many tomatoes were cooked in the fields when the temperature went up to 104 [F] in the shade. Next year farmers will have to provide sun-shades.</p><p>75 YEARS AGO:AUG. 11, 1949 Have You Bought Your Ticket Yet? Have you bought your tickets on the Elks\u2019 Barrel Roll, which will be held at their Labour Day celebrations in Ashcroft? The barrel will be placed in the Thompson River at Savona bridge, and you must guess the time it will take for it to reach Ashcroft bridge, a distance of 22 miles. As a guide, the time in 1944 was 9 hours, 36 minutes, 5 seconds.</p><p>Cannery:The Ashcroft cannery got steam up on Wednesday in preparation for the opening of canning of tomatoes. They expect to put up considerably more this year, as there are about 100 acres more in tomatoes and they have to put up the Kamloops crop also. Some local help is being employed, but it is necessary to bring in about 60 girls from the coast to handle peeling.</p><p>Old School To Open Again:The old school house built in the early years of the century, which has been used for a community hall since 1922, when the present four-room school was built, is again being converted into a temporary quarters as a high school until such time as a new one can be built. The attendance has become so large that the present accommodation is unable to accommodate the number. The remodelling will be ready for the opening of school at the close of the summer holiday. The old school was built early in the century. It was the third to be built here, the second being built in 1890. Before that time classes met in an old log building at the north end of Railway Avenue, facing down the street, and was known as the \u201cHouse of Blazes\u201d.</p><p>Building Boom Reaches Ashcroft:Ashcroft may not be booming, but the building, remodelling, and improvement campaign that has been going on all over B.C. has reached us, and today the old historic town is ringing with hammer and saw. On the flats down by the Thompson River [where the River Inn/Legacy Park campground are now located], Mr. M. Greatrix, who purchased this property from L.W. Cumming, who in turn purchased the Nesbitt estate to loosen up more land for Ashcroft, is building a modern auto park which will eventually comprise 24 duplex cabins, modern in every way. Here the land will be landscaped and planted with shrubbery and trees and made into one of the prettiest and most attractive auto courts in B.C.</p><p>50 YEARS AGO:AUG. 8, 1974 Fire Bomber; Plane Crash Kills Three:All three crew members were killed when a passenger plane converted to a water bomber crashed while fighting a forest fire in the Highland Valley area southeast of Ashcroft. Search and rescue officials said it was dropping fire retardant on the blaze when, according to the pilot of another plane, it crashed. Crew members were James Ferrell, 54, of Abbotsford, the pilot; first officer Philip Clack, 45, of Victoria; and William Sameluk, 20, of Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p><p>Fraser Canyon Closures:The Fraser Canyon section of the Trans-Canada Highway will be closed to through traffic from 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. every weekday for about 14 weeks starting Aug. 6. The closures are necessary because of a major rock removal project involving daily blasting at Hell\u2019s Gate. Only about a mile of the highway will be closed, and the blocked-off section will be between the west portal of the Hell\u2019s Gate tunnel and the Air Tram parking lot. The project involves the removal of 16,000 to 20,000 tons of rock and shot-creting the rock face, that is, sealing it with a sprayed-on concrete mix. The work is part of a continuing maintenance and stabilization process at the Hell\u2019s Gate bluffs.</p><p>Walhachin News:There seems to be a paucity of news lately, probably due to the heat:no one has the energy to hatch out a happening. The gardens are flourishing in the heat, although flowers seem to suffer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASHCCJ-news20240808PPIA0004531043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASHCCJ2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CNT-YV01-JD2C-J095-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

With support from FedEx, International Medical Corps (IMC) created the Principles of Psychological First Aid (PPFA) training to equip first responders with the skills to compassionately support affected individuals and families. Yvonne Groenhout, an ICU nurse and IMC first responder, is one of 5,000 global medical professionals trained on PPFA. The PPFA training enabled Yvonne and so many others to spot people struggling in the aftermath of an emergency and provide them with the support they need to recover and stay healthy. </p><p>Restoring access to care after tornado destroys clinic After a tornado ravaged the Delta Health Center in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, Heart to Heart International (HHI) stepped in to help. With support from FedEx, HHI deployed a disaster team, mobile medical units, and a portable clinic to ensure medical care continuity. The clinic staff, now equipped with secure facilities, aided storm victims and reached elderly patients in remote areas. This has given us such an advantage as we work to continue to improve our disaster response efforts. Maddy Langemach Disaster Response Specialist for Heart to Heart International Helping to fund the Grassroots Revolution in Canada With support from FedEx, GlobalMedic delivered 50+ tons of aid across Canada as part of its Grassroots Revolution - a suite of programs that address chronic emergencies. The deliveries included food, medical supplies, and hygiene items for Hurricane Fiona victims in Atlantic Canada, support for domestic Emergency Food and Hygiene Hub programs, and fire skid units for British Columbia's forest fire relief. FedEx Canadian volunteers chipped in to help, assembling food kits for survivors across the region. No-cost trainings bolster disaster management capabilities within at-risk communities Team Rubicon aids communities worldwide in disaster preparedness. FedEx helps fund expert exercises, led by FEMA-trained practitioners, to stress-test plans, identify deficiencies, and bolster response capabilities. From simulations to nuclear disaster drills, Team Rubicon empowers communities of all sizes to face any calamity. I get to help train communities to better respond, and FedEx helps get us there before that worst day happens. Greg Ramoni Exercise &amp;Field Leadership Manager, Team Rubicon A long-term collaboration to deliver aid in Chile FedEx delivered 40 tons of aid across Chile in 2023 in partnership with Desafo Levantemos Chile. Together we supported rehabilitation projects in fire and f lood-hit areas including rebuilding the Rural Medical Station in Santa Juana. With a network spanning 400 Chilean cities, FedEx has signed on to facilitate charitable transportation for Desafo Levantemos Chile on a regular basis. FedEx has been one of our strongest logistical allies in dozens of emergencies since 2012. They help us to be more efficient and faster in the transportation \" of donations, reaching more families and entrepreneurs who need to get back on their feet. Ignacio Serrano Executive Director of Desafo Levantemos Chile All hands on deck to support Turkey after the earthquake On February 6, 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey near the Syrian border, followed by aftershocks up to 7.5 magnitude. Tragically, over 50,000 people died, with significant damage to infrastructure including destruction of many homes, businesses, hospitals, and utilities. Nine million individuals were directly affected and three million were displaced. FedEx is committed to helping the many communities impacted by the earthquakes during this incredibly difficult time. We are inspired by the heroic work of first responders and humanitarian organizations and grateful to use our global network to donate flights, logistics support, and aid to advance recovery, rebuilding, and relief in the region. Raj Subramaniam FedEx President and CEO FedEx receives OTHERS Award FedEx received the OTHERS Award from The Salvation Army, recognizing our commitment to humanitarian efforts worldwide. Named after William Booth's succinct telegram urging service to others, the award highlights the FedEx donation of 22 mobile feeding units to Salvation Army locations globally. This gesture reflects our company's ongoing dedication to disaster relief and aiding communities in need. Within hours of the earthquake in Turkey, FedEx began our multidimensional response: //st * Donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to aid recovery efforts in Turkey and Syrian communities * Delivered critical humanitarian supplies from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport to Malatya, Turkey, on behalf of the Istanbul Governorship and local municipality * Flew five consecutive flights from February 17 to 21, which delivered approximately 230 metric tons of relief supplies including tents, blankets, baby items, household supplies, and hygiene kits * Provided shipping support for Canadian disaster-relief organization GlobalMedic, including the delivery of AquaResponse3 Water Purification Units * With the help of FedEx, Water Mission shipped five of its Living Water Treatment Systems to Turkey to provide emergency safe water access to those impacted by the devastating earthquakes * Worked with World Central Kitchen to ship a deployable kitchen unit, kitchen supplies, and operations kits from Madrid, Spain, and Capitol Heights, Maryland, U.S., to Adana, Turkey * FedEx Cares team members in Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, and Slovenia collected items for the local Red Cross/Red Crescent societies and donated approximately 885 kilos of supplies including new warm clothes and shoes, blankets, hygienic materials, and family tents Read more Click here to learn about FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program.

Thomson said in community consultations with B.C. Timber Sales and the sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Nation, co-managers of the timber licences, residents were assured that fire mitigation would take place and the slash burned off during the rainy season.\u00a0</p><p>But that hasn't happened, and now Thomson's group has been informed by the sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Nation that the piles will remain through a second summer because the window to burn has closed.</p><p/><p>With forest fire season already underway in B.C., the news isn't sitting well.</p><p>\"We see this hazard right on our doorstep and we don't know who's responsible for it and ... how the fuel on the ground will be dealt with,\" she said.</p><p>A request for an interview with a B.C. Timber Sales representative was relayed to the Ministry of Forests, Land and Natural Resources (MFLNR), however no one was available to speak to the residents' concerns.</p><p>In emails sent to CBC\u00a0News, MFLNR said its compliance and enforcement branch had received a report of \"potential non-compliance,\" in the area and had conducted a site inspection on May 1.</p><p/><p>\"Until this incident can be assessed further it is considered under investigation and we are not able to release further information at this time,\" said the ministry.</p><p>Prime Length Timber Limited logged seven of the estimated 21 cutblocks residents have raised as problematic.</p><p>According to president Ben Drosdovech, last year's fire season extended later into the year than usual, squeezing the amount of time available to burn\u00a0the piles in a way that would meet regulations.</p><p>Drosdovech said one measure currently underway to mitigate the\u00a0fire risk in the area is deactivating\u00a0logging roads to reduce public access.</p><p>\"I understand the concerns that the residents have,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's really important for everyone to know that the risk of human-caused wildfire ignition is something that was there long before the logging took place and it's something that's going to be there after the piles are gone and it's all grown back.\"</p><p/><p>According to B.C.'sWildfire Act, timber licensees are responsible for fire hazard abatement on the land they log.</p><p>Thomson said any\u00a0wildfire would be potentially devastating to the entire region.</p><p>\"We're just worried. We see it as an accident waiting to happen,\" she said. \"We're at the tip of the Sechelt Peninsula and there's not a lot of ways out for people who live there.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadabritishcolumbiaslashpilessunshinecoastwildfire17185107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BYX-YGG1-F03F-K2F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

It's what we were all hoping wouldn't happen,\" Furey said in St. John's. The fire grew from a Category 2 fire to a Category 4 fire between Tuesday morning and Tuesday afternoon, he added.</p><p>\"So there is very much a heightened level of risk of fire propagation now on the community side of the river,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"We'll continue to provide mitigation efforts on both sides of the river, and we hope that that will contain the fire.\"</p><p>The change in the fire has prompted a full evacuation of Churchill Falls in a phased approach.</p><p>Between 80 and 100 people remained in the community to operate the town's power plant,\u00a0including operations and site services,\u00a0fire services and clearing work for a fire break currently under construction.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro told CBC News that workers deemed essential will be the last to leave the town, but officials aren't sure how long that will take.</p><p>Much of the town's population of around 750 people was evacuated last Wednesday.</p><p>Jamie Chippett, deputy minister of the Department of Fisheries, Forestry, and Agriculture, said attention now shifts to fighting the leading edge of the fire\u00a0- provided it doesn't get worse.</p><p>\"If we can keep the fire from getting to Level 5 or a Level 6, then I think we would be working hard, similar to what we've been doing before,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"If we get to a five or a six\u00a0in classification, it's really at the limit or beyond the limit of bombers being able to be in the air.\"</p><p>'Planning for this eventuality'</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro CEO Jennifer Williams said workers have been preparing for changes to the status quo.</p><p>\"We were planning for this eventuality,\" she said. \"That is why we made adjustments at the plant last night.\"</p><p/><p>As a precautionary measure, Hydro had\u00a0begun releasing water at its Churchill Falls power plant Monday night in case\u00a0the Crown corporation needed\u00a0to remove even more staff from an evacuated community already under serious fire threat.\u00a0</p><p>\"We will definitely continue to take direction from the officials, but in our planning scenarios we are planning for hotel rooms, we are planning for charter flights ... arranged and on standby,\" Williams told reporters.\u00a0</p><p>Hydro had also already started reducing energy loads in anticipation of further evacuations.\u00a0The release of water will also help beleaguered crews who face another hot, rainless day while trying to control the\u00a0fire.</p><p>On Monday night, the Crown corporation announced it was doing a controlled water release from the upper Churchill reservoir at the Jacopie Spillway for an unknown amount of time.</p><p/><p>In the event the plant\u00a0goes to remote operations, not as much water will go through the turbines. Spilling water prevents water in the reservoir from rising too high.</p><p>The statement said water management is a part of protecting the plant's assets.</p><p>Williams said the plant is operating at a much lower operating load than usual. N.L. Hydro has notified customers that they should keep their energy usage around the same levels for the time being to keep things as close to the status quo.</p><p>Crews have also been working to give the plant, which was designed in the late 1960s, a limited ability to be controlled remotely.</p><p>As of Tuesday morning, current Churchill Falls generation was at 1,462 megawatts, according to Hydro's website. Earlier this week, that rate was 3,000 megawatts.</p><p>The change has no impact for Hydro customers, Williams said, and plans are in the works to ensure there will be no impact if output drops further.</p><p>As a safety measure, the N.L. Hydro statement advised people to avoid the Jacopie and Whitefish spillways, the Churchill River bed downstream of the spillway, the Churchill River walking trail, as well as the east and west forebay water storage areas north of the town.</p><p>It added that Tuesday will be a \"critical\" day to fight the out-of-control fire that is on the doorstep of one of North America's largest power plants.\u00a0</p><p>Provincial forest fire duty officer Mark Lawlor said Tuesday that pumping additional water into the river valley will help firefighting efforts because it increases the region's humidity.</p><p>\"Any moisture in the area is a help,\" he told CBC\u00a0News.</p><p>The additional water would also increase the width of the river, thereby covering fuel that the fire could feed on, Lawlor added.</p><p>According to the Newfoundland and Labrador government's active fire dashboard, there are nine fires Tuesday in Labrador and one in Newfoundland, which\u00a0is now under control.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador. </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador\">Click here to visit our landing page</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanewfoundlandlabradorchurchillfallswaterspillage17245575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBC-BYF1-F03F-K3DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>11:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

But as the effects of climate change become more and more apparent, it becomes harder to view these storms and fires the way we might have a decade ago -\u00a0as singular \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://mitchinsurance.com/blog/acts-god-property-insurance-cover/\">acts of God</url>\" that can be blamed on bad luck or unusual circumstances.</p><p>And the more these disasters happen,\u00a0the greater the likelihood that voters will start asking governments what they could have done to mitigate or prevent them.</p><p>When that happens, political leaders will need to answer two questions. What are they doing to reduce the amount of unavoidable damage caused by climate change? And what are they doing to to\u00a0prevent even more extreme climate change from\u00a0happening?</p><p>In policy terms, these two approaches are known as adaptation and mitigation -\u00a0adapting to a changing environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate future climate change.</p><p>In the wake of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/jasper-wildfire-how-did-it-get-so-out-of-control-1.7282633\">Jasper wildfire</url> last month, some asked whether federal officials should have done more to manage a pine beetle infestation that left behind swaths of dead trees across Western Canada. But experts suggested attempts to blame the infestation for the destruction are either <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/what-fed-jasper-wildfire\">misplaced</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/10670403/jasper-alberta-wildfire-conditions-response-experts/\">lacking</url>.</p><p>\"The condition of the forest after a century of fire exclusion followed by the mountain pine beetle infestation was an important contributing factor that created very high fuel loads over the entire landscape,\"\u00a0said\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/lori-daniels/\">Lori Daniels</url>, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>\"Equally important was the extreme fire weather conditions due to the severe, multi-week drought and heat dome that had been sitting over Western Canada.\u00a0Ultimately, the heat and high winds drove the speed and intensity of the fire, making it impossible to suppress.\"</p><p/><p>It would be\u00a0a mistake to look for scapegoats to avoid acknowledging the impact of climate change. But it's not necessarily wrong to ask\u00a0more broadly\u00a0whether governments could be doing more to limit the damage caused by the fires and storms that are now commonplace.</p><p>Even though hundreds of Jasper's\u00a0buildings were destroyed,\u00a0the fact that 70 per cent of the town was saved\u00a0is being\u00a0held up\u00a0by some\u00a0as a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/with-the-flames-expected-to-flare-crews-make-critical-progress-in-fighting-jasper-wildfire-1.7278443\">success</url>\u00a0story.\u00a0That success is\u00a0being\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://edmontonjournal.com/news/jasper-wildfire-response-praised\">credited</url>, in part, to implementation of measures like the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/prepare/firesmart\">FireSmart</url>\u00a0program. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tru.ca/research/research-centres/wildfire-science/mike-flannigan.html\">Mike Flannigan</url>, a wildfire expert at Thompson Rivers University, says the program should be mandatory in high-risk areas.</p><p>The Jasper fire has revived questions about whether Canada needs a federal emergency response agency; the Liberal government says it is actively exploring the idea. But Daniels says local communities also need to build up their research and expertise so that they're better equipped to manage the forests around them.</p><p>The federal government released a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/national-adaptation-strategy/full-strategy.html\">national adaptation strategy</url> in 2023 - the first such national strategy in Canadian history. It followed up with an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/national-adaptation-strategy/action-plan.html\">action plan</url> that includes 73 different measures. But it's fair to ask how much more all levels of government could or should be doing.</p><p>Blair Feltmate and Anabela Bonada of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-lesson-of-the-jasper-wildfire-is-spend-less-on-fighting-climate/\">wrote</url> that, since 2015, the federal government has committed $42 billion toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and $1.9 billion to adaptation. The exact numbers might be debatable -\u00a0the federal government claims to have committed $6.6 billion to adaptation since 2015 -\u00a0but whatever the amount, it could stand to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateinstitute.ca/national-adaptation-strategy-more-crucial-than-ever-as-climate-risks-hit-close-to-home-for-millions/\">higher</url>.</p><p/><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://fcm.ca/en/resources/investing-in-canadas-future\">report</url> prepared in 2020 by the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities\u00a0estimated that all three levels of government need to spend an additional $5.3 billion on adaptation.</p><p>\"I think ultimately we are going to have to take a hard look at what governments have been doing about adapting to climate change versus the growing scale of the problem,\" Ryan Ness of the Climate Institute said in an interview last month.</p><p>\"A successful adaptation would mean flatlining or reducing climate related damage [in relation to the economy] as climate change proceeds, but we're not seeing that.\"</p><p>In the long term, investments in adaptation could pay for themselves many times over. The Canadian Climate Institute has <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateinstitute.ca/reports/damage-control/\">estimated</url> that a dollar spent today on adaptation could save between $13 and $15 in future costs. But governments still need to find budget room for that upfront spending.</p><p>How much more is the Liberal government willing to put up? And would a Conservative government under Pierre Poilievre, committed to reducing taxes and slashing federal spending, make room for larger investments in adaptation?</p><p/><p>Feltmate and Bonada suggested that new money for adaptation could be freed up by reducing the amount of funding put toward reducing emissions -\u00a0but that could make for a short-sighted trade-off.</p><p>When the Climate Institute conducted its analysis in 2022,\u00a0it found that climate-related economic losses in Canada could be reduced by 50 per cent through either reductions in global emissions or adaptation.\u00a0But in a scenario where\u00a0global\u00a0emissions were low and Canada took robust steps to deal with the impact of climate change, losses were reduced by 75 per cent.</p><p>In other words, everyone is better off when governments do as much as they can on both fronts.\u00a0</p><p>Emissions reductions have attracted\u00a0the most political attention in the context of recent disasters. The Liberals, in particular, have linked their actions\u00a0to combat climate change with the fires and storms that have upended numerous communities across Canada.</p><p>\"People are being evacuated in the Northwest Territories,\" Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said during a question period exchange in June. \"What is the Conservative response? It is to let the planet burn. It is immoral.\"</p><p>\"The fanatical rhetoric of the extremist minister will not change anything, nor will his carbon tax change the weather,\" Poilievre responded. \"His carbon tax is not going to eliminate a single forest fire, a single drought or a single heat wave.\"</p><p>Read narrowly -\u00a0and perhaps charitably -\u00a0Poilievre's response could be understood as a criticism of the effectiveness of the Liberal government's carbon-pricing policy.</p><p/><p>Conservatives like to argue that the carbon tax doesn't actually reduce emissions\u00a0- but the Climate Institute has <url normalizedValue=\"https://440megatonnes.ca/insight/industrial-carbon-pricing-systems-driver-emissions-reductions/\">estimated</url> that the federal fuel charge will be responsible for between eight and 14 per cent of projected emissions reductions between now and 2030. (The price on industrial emissions is expected to be responsible for a further 20 to 48 per cent of reductions.)</p><p>The climate change that is now making fires and floods more frequent and more severe is driven by decades of inaction on greenhouse gas emissions. Some amount of climate change is now unavoidable - it's fair to say that a carbon tax now won't stop a wildfire from happening next week.</p><p>But those who've seen their homes flooded or burned this summer might wish that previous governments - in Canada and globally -\u00a0had done much more to prevent it from happening. And by reducing emissions now, it's still possible to reduce the amount of damage done in the future.</p><p>Political pressure may ebb and flow. But there is still every reason to act to fight climate change, to both adapt and mitigate. And the more often fires and floods and droughts and heat waves happen, the more reasons voters will have to demand accountability from their political leaders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewspoliticsclimatechangewildfirejasperflood17296881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CRN-9SV1-F03F-K4TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1355\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Now, the government has ignored wildfire workers' recommendations to fix the crisis, and instead, has scrambled to throw scraps at the crisis and the frontline workers who risk their lives to keep Ontario safe.</p><p>\"Instead of being proactive and focusing on real solutions - like recognizing Wildland fire workers for the work they do and compensating them properly, or ensuring they have the coverage they need for the risks they face - this government is choosing PR stunts,\" said OPSEU/SEFPO President JP Hornick. \"They're more concerned about suppressing criticism than protecting our air quality and human life.\"</p><p>While the union has agreed to the one-time bonus for members, Hornick says the process has been deeply problematic.</p><p>\"Let's be clear, this was not an open conversation about finding real, long-term sustainable solutions,\" said Hornick. \"This was a take-it or leave-it, one-sided decision. At the same time this government was pretending to talk to Wildland fire workers and'make a deal', they were threatening those who actually speak out with valid concerns. Senior management even sent a memo threatening workers with an investigation into any public criticism.\"</p><p>The one-time bonus will include $5000 for those in certain job classifications. Originally the government wanted to exclude a significant portion of the AFFES workforce, but the workers pushed back to ensure that those members would receive a $1000 bonus. However, these will all be lump sum payments that do not contribute to workers' salaries or pensions.</p><p>\"We won't stop here or be silenced,\" added Hornick. \"Today's announced bonus has only strengthened Wildland fire workers' resolve to keep up the fight and keep up the pressure. It proves that worker power wins, and we won't stop until this crisis is resolved and these workers have the respect they deserve.\"</p><p>SOURCE  Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU/SEFPO)</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2024/21/c6072.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2024/21/c6072.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20240321C6072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKY-NC11-DYRK-D002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><timeReceived>5:22 PM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 21, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A report of voting results will be available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>FOREST FIRE UPDATETourmaline experienced evacuations and production disruptions during the month of May in both Alberta and NEBC. The Company is pleased to report that there were no injuries to staff related to the fires, no damage to producing infrastructure and that production has resumed at all but one of the affected facilities. The Laprise Creek plant in NEBC, with net production of approximately 11,000 boepd, is currently in an evacuation zone and remains shut in. The Company is expecting to re-establish access during the next week. Tourmaline estimates that the overall net impact to Q2 2023 production from the wildfire events is in the 1.5-2.0% range.</p><p> Reader Advisories</p><p>Currency</p><p>All amounts in this news release are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Forward-Looking Information</p><p>This news release contains forward-looking information and statements (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of any of the words \"forecast\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"objective\", \"ongoing\", \"on track\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"believe\", \"plans\", \"intends\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking information. More particularly and without limitation, this news release contains forward-looking information concerning the future payment of dividends and the timing and amount thereof which assumes the availability of free cash flow to fund such dividends and the estimated net impact to Q2 2023 productionof the fire related production disruptions. The forward-looking information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Tourmaline, including expectations and assumptions concerning the following: prevailing and future commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve volumes; operating costs, the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the benefits to be derived from acquisitions; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; ability to maintain its investment grade credit rating; and ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully. Without limitation of the foregoing, future dividend payments, if any, and the level thereof is uncertain, as the Company's dividend policy and the funds available for the payment of dividends from time to time is dependent upon, among other things, free cash flow, financial requirements for the Company's operations and the execution of its growth strategy, fluctuations in working capital and the timing and amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other factors beyond the Company's control. Further, the ability of Tourmaline to pay dividends will be subject to applicable laws (including the satisfaction of the solvency test contained in applicable corporate legislation) and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing its indebtedness, including its credit facility.</p><p>Although Tourmaline believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Tourmaline can give no assurances that it will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature it involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, production, revenues, costs and expenses; health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations; interest rate fluctuations; marketing and transportation; loss of markets; environmental risks; competition; incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions; failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions; ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources;uncertainties associated with counterparty credit risk; failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; climate change risks; inflation; supply chain risks; the impact of wars (including the war in Ukraine), hostilities, civil insurrections, pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease in Canada or worldwide; and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties and environmental regulations. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.</p><p>Additional information on these and other factors that could affect Tourmaline, or its operations or financial results, are included in the Company's most recently filed Management's Discussion and Analysis (See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" therein), Annual Information Form (See \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>) or Tourmaline's website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tourmalineoil.com\">www.tourmalineoil.com</url>).</p><p>The forward-looking information contained in this news release is made as of the date hereof and Tourmaline undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless expressly required by applicable securities laws.</p><p> About Tourmaline Oil Corp.</p><p>Tourmaline is Canada's largest and most active natural gas producer dedicated to producing the lowest-emission and lowest-cost natural gas in North America.

Some residents in the County of Grande Prairie were also issued an evacuation order Friday night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Richard Wong, CAPP's vice-president, regulatory and operations, said 'lessons learned' from last year's extreme wildfire season will be employed going forward.</p><p>'There were certainly a lot of learnings that arose out of last year, but a lot of good work happened, as well. I think wildfires are certainly something we are always thinking about. Obviously, our industry really plans for all emergencies and disasters, including wildfire,' he told DOB Energy.</p><p>'I would say that what we saw through last year was really a focus, first and foremost, on the safety of people and the environment. That's the safety of the residents in the areas in which we operate, but also the safety of the folks that work in our industry in the field,' Wong added.</p><p>'We're really closely monitoring conditions with respect to wildfire, recognizing that it's important for us to co-ordinate with provincial agencies and stakeholders to coordinate responses.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alberta.ca/alberta-wildfire\">According to Alberta Wildfire </url>, as of Saturday there were 54 total active wildfires burning throughout the province, including two deemed out of control.</p><p>Wong said strong communication between industry and provincial authorities is, and will continue to be, essential as wildfire season kicks into high gear in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>'That was really one of the key learnings, I think, out of last year - just the importance of having regular touch-points so that we can remain vigilant, and so that everyone is kind of aware of the lay of the land if issues are to arise in the future,' Wong said.</p><p>He noted that the oil and gas sector has 'really strong' emergency response protocols in place that are continually being revised and enhanced.</p><p>'I know that a lot of our members are actively reviewing and updating the emergency response plans that they have. They're making sure that through employee training, those emergency response exercises and drills are being done to make sure that we're ready if something is to happen,' Wong said.</p><p>'From CAPP's side, we've been liaising with provincial agencies just to make sure that folks are kind of aware that we're here if they need us.'</p><h> Efforts ongoing to manage wildfire risk </h><p>Wong said CAPP member companies 'do a lot of work' from an operational perspective to manage wildfire risk.</p><p>'Vegetation management is probably one you hear about - and certainly vegetation-free buffer zone sites - just to remove that fuel from being a potential fire hazard,' he said.</p><p>'There's enhanced use of technologies like satellite imagery, better tracking around meteorological data like wind speed just to better understand if a fire were to happen and [how to] to predict where impacts may come about.</p><p>'And then really just interacting with both the local agencies and the municipalities in the areas in which we're operating just so everyone kind of knows who's who in advance of any issue arising, any emergency situations arising.'</p><p>While not perfect, Wong believes the oil and gas industry 'did a really great job last year in what was a really challenging' wildfire response effort in 2023.</p><p>'One thing that really arose really quickly in June of last year was we really worked to closely co-ordinate to connect our members with the provincial government to make sure that we had a good understanding of how best to protect people and assets by really providing equipment and resources to help emergency crews with those fire responses,' he said.</p><p>'We heard stories about our members supplying helicopters to assist in surveillance, offering the kind of yellow-iron equipment, like bulldozers and excavators, to build fire breaks and, then, also access to water that's stored on sites,' Wong added.</p><p>'So all those pieces are important pieces of the puzzle as we kind of responded to the emergency that we had last year. So, I think really that's what we're taking a look at. I think we recognize that there are some lessons to learn from last year, and that wildfire planning is a continual thing. We're looking to apply the learnings from the 2023 wildfire season to better assess risks and refine our planning moving forward.'</p><h> Many companies built in a &amp;lsquo;buffer' in guidance </h><p> Jeremy McCrea, BMO Capital Markets' managing director of the firm's energy equity research team, said there is growing concern that Alberta producers will have to navigate another very active wildfire season.</p><p>'If you look at the updates on wildfire, it almost looks like the whole province is at high to extreme. So, it's kind of like, &amp;lsquo;Oh boy.' It's just going to be a matter of where is it happening and who gets impacted. So, it's a real thing,' he said.</p><p>After affected companies were forced to shut-in output for periods of time last year because of wildfire risk, McCrea said that has been factored in the guidance issued by some producers.</p><p>'The one thing I will make a comment on is that when you look at company guidances, given what happened last year, a lot of companies have built in a buffer for shut-ins related to potential fires. It's almost like it's pre-built into the guidance that there is going to be, somewhere, somehow, forest fires,' he said.</p><p>'So even if there are major fires, we actually might not see the impact on guidance because it's already built in. And if the forest fire season is actually maybe not as bad as we kind of think, there may actually be revisions upwards.'</p><p> Andrew Botterill, national oil, gas and chemicals leader at Deloitte Canada, added that producers have come to expect an increased wildfire risk as a normal course of business.</p><p>'I think it's clear that we have, and will have, forest fire and wildfire concerns each and every year as we look to the types of places where we are producing and developing as oil and gas &amp;hellip; especially in our western forested areas,' he said.</p><p>'It's a prevailing theme that I think we've, unfortunately, gone through a lot. So, now, producers are able to have all the risk mitigation and processes and procedures in place to make sure everyone is safe, and operations are safe, and reliable,' Botterill added.</p><p>Botterill's 2024 wildfire take/outlook?</p><p>'It's hard to imagine this summer is going to be different from the previous ones,' he said.</p><p>During the Pembina Pipeline Corporation first quarter of 2024 earnings call, an analyst, noting word of low water levels in western Canada, dry conditions, and concerns around wildfire risk, asked executives about preparing its marketing business and operations.</p><p>Additionally, she asked about expectations around volumes on the company'9;s systems and the potential of preemptive facility shutdowns in advance of wildfires.</p><p> Jaret Sprott, Pembina'9;s senior vice-president and chief operating officer, called her remark on water levels and dryness &amp;quot;100 per cent accurate.</p><p>&amp;quot;The conversations we have [had] with our customers to date is the majority of our customers have retained the water that'9;s required in their pits and/or their storage facilities,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;A lot of our customers have recycling operations, et cetera. So, that'9;s what we'9;re hearing from them to date, is ... their ability to stimulate the wells go forward. They don'9;t have a lot of concerns with that.</p><p>Pembina monitors wildfire activity on a 24/7 basis, said Sprott.</p><p>&amp;quot;There'9;s nothing active to date near our assets that would give us any concern,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;There [is] no anticipation right now to be preemptively shutting in assets.</p><p>'And just to note, last year, any assets that we did shut in, they were primarily due to our ability to get our employees safely out of harm'9;s way. So, the actual assets themselves were never in physical danger.</p><p>'The egress component is why we would have had to shut down last year.</p><p>'But I would say we'9;re well-prepared, monitoring it. We just did get some pretty good rain here in the last few days, but definitely hoping for wetter weather.&amp;quot;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DOILBN-DOB182264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOILBN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8X-MHF1-JCM9-500Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300449</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 \u00c2\u00a9 JWN Media, a geoLOGIC company.

Last year, fires started very early in the spring, spread extremely quickly and kept emergency responders busy throughout the summer. More than 2.84 million hectares burned, and thousands of people in affected areas had only a short time to evacuate. Sadly, six wildfire personnel lost their lives, and hundreds of homes were destroyed or damaged.\"</p><p>As of March 1, the provincial snowpack remains very low, averaging 34% below normal across BC. Nearly half of the province's 34 water basins were severely depleted due to warmer temperatures and a lack of precipitation, further elevating concerns for this wildfire season. Current information about the forest fire danger, forest fire activity and fire restrictions across the province can be found on the BC Wildfire Service's webpage. Residents can also access the BC Wildfire Service's Wildfire Situation App for real-time information on active fires, current fire danger across the province, and restricted fire zones in effect.</p><p>\"IBC is urging BC residents to stay alert and follow the advice of local authorities when it comes to fire bans,\" added de Pruis. \"In the event that you are evacuated, make sure you plan as you could be out of your home for more than one or two days. Last year, many individuals and families were displaced for several days or longer.\"</p><p>Wildfires are a real and present danger, especially if you live in a heavily forested area. However, there are steps you can take to help protect your family, your home or your business.</p><p>All standard home, tenant and business insurance policies cover damage caused by wildfire. Most policies also cover additional living expenses, such as for hotels or other accommodation, if you are evacuated. During major weather events or wildfires, insurance companies may initiate temporary limitations on the sale of new policies in areas under imminent threat. Therefore, ensure you have the right coverage well in advance of a potential severe weather event or wildfire.</p><p>BC residents with general questions about their home, business or tenant's insurance policies are encouraged to contact IBC's Consumer Information Centre at 1-844-2ask-IBC (1-844-227-5422) or visit ibc.ca.</p><p> Protect your home before and during wildfire season with these 10 tips from IBC</p><p>Ways to be prepared year-round:</p><p>1. Install and regularly maintain smoke and CO alarms in your home. Remove dust from your alarms, replace batteries when the clocks change in spring and fall, test alarms regularly and replace them at least every 10 years.</p><p>2. Create an emergency preparedness plan and a disaster safety kit for your family. Develop a fire evacuation plan, practise it and stick to it in an emergency. Also, prepare a basic kit of food, water and other necessities in case of evacuation</p><p>3. Keep your insurance policy number and insurance company claims department phone number with you. If your home is damaged or you are evacuated, you will be able to contact your insurer more easily to start the claims process.Review and understand what coverage you have, and how your policy will respond if a wildfire affects you.</p><p>Actions you can take now, particularly if you live near a forest or wooded area:</p><p>4. Prepare your home. Check that your home's roof and exterior walls and the undersides of balconies are treated with flame-resistant materials.</p><p>5. Properly store flammable materials.Store gasoline, solvents or other materials that may ignite, at least 10 metres away from your home.</p><p>6. Remove dry leaves and debris.Keep leaves, other dry materials and potentially flammable garbage away from the exterior of the house, especially if you have wood or vinyl siding.</p><p>7. Manage space around your home.Remove combustible material such as shrubs, trees and woodpiles within 10 metres of your home.</p><p>8. Read these valuable resourcesfrom FireSmart Canada for in-depth information about wildfire resilience and steps you can take to minimize wildfire risk</p><p>How to reduce your risk when wildfire season is in full swing:</p><p>9. Stay informed about the weather. Be sure to monitor local and provincial information sources for fire bans and warnings.</p><p>10.Pay attention to fire danger ratings. Take note of and obey fire bans and restrictions to know the likelihood of, and prevent, wildfire igniting in your region. Check your local government's website for more information.</p><p>As reported by IBCearlier this year, severe weather in 2023 caused over $3.1 billion in insured damage across Canada. IBC is continuing to engage with the federal and provincial governments on ways to improve the climate resilience of communities across the country. Insured losses related to severe weather in Canada now routinely exceed $2 billion annually. By comparison, between 2001 and 2010, Canadian insurers averaged $675 million a year in losses related to severe weather.</p><p> About Insurance Bureau of Canada</p><p>Established in 1964, Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) is the national industry association representing Canada's private home, auto and business insurers.

That could be a hazardous waste spill, that could be to secure the scene of an accident, do traffic control,\" Coady told CBC News.</p><p>Municipal\u00a0fire departments frequently attend emergencies outside city boundaries. Doing so\u00a0can be costly, according to Coady.</p><p>She says fire departments, which are funded by\u00a0municipalities, have to pay for backup staff, fuel\u00a0and equipment. The province has a policy by which\u00a0departments can claim some of the costs, but Coady says it's not enough, and municipalities are forced to fill in the gaps from their own coffers.</p><p>\"Operating a municipality,\u00a0we are already stretched to the max,\" she said.</p><p>\"When we are dealing with infrastructure and recreation needs, just basic services provided to our communities and our residents, any additional costs related to fire services would come back to the municipality and we would be responsible for finding those funds.\"</p><p/><p>Given the rising costs of helping out in rural areas, Municipalities N.L. and the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Fire Services lobbied the government for more money for municipal fire services\u00a0during pre-budget consultations last fall.\u00a0</p><p>The province\u00a0delivered with an increase of $400,000, for a total of $525,000 per year,\u00a0a pot of funding that communities can dip into when they find themselves covering out-of-bounds emergencies.</p><p>\"We heard their concerns, and that's why we as a government made the decision to increase the budget right now to pay for those increased costs,\" said John Hogan, minister of justice and public safety.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Long overdue</emphasis></p><p>Hogan says the funding set aside for local fire services has not seen an increase in years and, with the cost of everything going up, the additional money was needed.</p><p>\"Really, a large portion of the increase in the budget will be to cover costs of fire trucks that need to use more fuel to travel to the highway,\" said Hogan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH | The CBC's Colleen Connors reports on the long-awaited extra money for firefighting efforts: </emphasis></emphasis></p><p>\"We are really happy to see our advocacy efforts were successful,\" said Coady.</p><p>\"It's important the work our fire services do. It's important they are recognized for the work they do but also the fire departments are compensated adequately for their time and their talents.\"</p><p/><p>In past years, a municipal fire department would\u00a0attend the scene of a vehicle fire outside its city boundary and the municipality would\u00a0submit a claim for reimbursement to the provincial government for $350 for the first three hours of service.</p><p>Coady would like to see that changed to $350 per hour, now that there is additional funding.\u00a0</p><p>Hogan says the calculations have not been finalized yet\u00a0but the policy should be updated at the next stakeholders' meeting.</p><p>Some of the additional $400,000 will go into researching how much money municipalities are spending on outside services. With increasing\u00a0natural disasters like floods and fires, said Coady, the need seems to be growing.</p><p>\"We are seeing that more and more with climate change, responding to forest fires that happen on the outskirts of our communities and having to clean up after flooding and damages,\" said Coady.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our</emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">\u00a0free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.</emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador\">\u00a0Click here to visit our landing page</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanewfoundlandlabradorfirefightingfunding17189396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXN-SSN1-F03F-K064-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><timeReceived>3:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Complicated because, unlike a small town where the big decision is whether to go to the park or the restaurant, this big city reacts to heat and sun by exploding in a million different directions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There will be moments of sun-kissed bliss and dappled delight. Also, boiling anger in traffic gridlock and endless ferry lines, and everything in between.</p><p>We compiled 10 key facts that illuminate torrid Toronto to help you survive, and even thrive, through the lazy, hazy and occasionally crazy days of summer. </p><p>1. Busiest outdoor pool</p><p>The city operates 140 outdoor pools, wading pools and splash pads, but Gus Ryder Pool remains the most popular. The Olympic-sized tank at Lake Shore Boulevard West and Parkside Drive, alongside Sunnyside beach and historic bathing pavilion, first opened in 1925 and was once the world's largest pool. Last summer, the busiest day was Friday, July 28 when Gus Ryder drew almost 1,700 bathers amid heat, humidity and four beaches closed by pollution levels.</p><p>2. Cleanest and dirtiest beaches</p><p>Beaches at Marie Curtis Park suffered the most no-swim days last summer due to high E. coli bacteria levels. The city deemed only 49 out of 91 days safe. Possible factors include nearby storm sewer outlets that, after heavy rainfall, can put sewage into the lake. The cleanest beaches were both on the islands. Hanlan's Point and Gibraltar beaches each recorded only one unsafe day last year.</p><p>3. Busiest park</p><p>The parks department doesn't track usage, but at about 400 acres High Park is the biggest city park. Despite friction over which users should get priority, including cyclists versus motorists, you can find quiet forest shade even on busy summer days in the sprawling landmark that has its own pond, trails and zoo. You will find no privacy, and not much of anything really, in Toronto's smallest park - the St. Mary Street Parkette in the Yonge Street and Charles Street area. At 56 square metres, it is about 29,000 times smaller than High Park. But it has a water fountain.</p><p>4. Worst day for gridlock</p><p>We can't say for certain which day will see the worst traffic this summer but we can draw some inferences from last year. According to city analysis of data from HERE Technologies, Tuesday, June 27 had the worst gridlock of summer 2023. Trips on average took 2.3 times longer than if traffic were free-flowing. That day included a Blue Jays game, CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer at BMO Field, Collision tech conference at Exhibition Place, plus rain as well as forest fire smoke. Potential days to avoid the roads this summer include the July 20-21 weekend that is packed with events including Honda Indy, South Asia Fest, Jays games and a Saturday concert at Budweiser Stage.</p><p>5. Biggest concert and sporting events</p><p>According to ticket reseller StubHub, P!NK's Aug. 14 show at Rogers Centre will be this summer's hot seller, followed by Usher at Scotiabank Arena on Sept. 3 and, on July 13 at Rogers Centre, Punjabi singer-turned-actor Diljit Dosanjh. Other big StubHub sellers include the July 5 to 7 WWE Money in the Bank Weekend at Scotiabank Arena, and the Jays' July 1 to 4 stand against the Houston Astros.</p><p>6. Heaviest wastewater day</p><p>The sewer system's biggest non-storm day last summer was July 5 when frequent flushing pushed a combined total of 1,400 million litres per day of wastewater to the four treatment plants. The day was part of a heat wave that pushed humidex levels close to 40C, strained the city's electricity grid and, evidently, saw a lot of Torontonians try to stay hydrated.</p><p>7. A nicer smell, in the parks</p><p>People enjoying parks might not be able to name the blooms but flowers definitely add to the experience. The city grows about one million plants annually in parks, gardens and conservatories. The most common flower is the Tuberous Begonia - with large, colourful and fragrant petals - numbering about 60,000 this year.</p><p>8. Noisiest patio</p><p>The patio that got the most noise complaints last summer, according to the city, was The Morning After restaurant on Fort York Boulevard, which was the subject of a dozen complaints. A manager said it remained open late to make up for pandemic losses but this summer is usually closing at 4 p.m. It also has a louvred roof to minimize noise travelling up to surrounding CityPlace condos. The Star visited on a Friday afternoon and found neighbouring Hunters Landing patio - with European soccer commentary blaring from an outward-pointing speaker - much louder.</p><p>9. Ferry frustration</p><p>An unfortunate rite of passage is standing in a long, hot queue trying to get on a ferry to the Toronto islands. Over the past three summers, ferry demand has peaked over the Simcoe Day long weekend in early August. City staff said this year they are taking steps to lessen lineups - including getting more people to buy tickets online than at ferry kiosk terminals - but the eventual fix will be new electric ferries with greater carrying capacity.</p><p>10. Busiest LCBO day</p><p>No big surprise that June 30 - Canada Day eve - saw the biggest Toronto-area summer sales last year. The most popular summer drink orders through LCBO online were Cutwater Tequila Margarita, Ace Hill Lemon Vodka Soda and Ace Hill Raspberry Vodka Soda.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2024063071978927</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CCH-2VX1-F197-508C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Complicated because, unlike a small town where the big decision is whether to go to the park or the restaurant, this big city reacts to heat and sun by exploding in a million different directions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There will be moments of sun-kissed bliss and dappled delight. Also, boiling anger in traffic gridlock and endless ferry lines, and everything in between.</p><p>We compiled 10 key facts that illuminate torrid Toronto to help you survive, and even thrive, through the lazy, hazy and occasionally crazy days of summer.</p><p>1. Busiest outdoor pool</p><p>The city operates 140 outdoor pools, wading pools and splash pads, but Gus Ryder Pool remains the most popular. The Olympic-sized tank at Lake Shore Boulevard West and Parkside Drive, alongside Sunnyside beach and a historic bathing pavilion, first opened in 1925 and was once the world's largest pool. Last summer, the busiest day was Friday, July 28, when Gus Ryder drew almost 1,700 bathers amid heat, humidity and four beaches closed by pollution levels.</p><p>2. Cleanest and dirtiest beaches</p><p>Beaches at Marie Curtis Park suffered the most no-swim days last summer due to high E. coli bacteria levels. The city deemed only 49 out of 91 days safe. Possible factors include nearby storm sewer outlets that, after heavy rainfall, can put sewage into the lake. The cleanest beaches were both on the islands. Hanlan's Point and Gibraltar beaches each recorded only one unsafe day last year.</p><p>3. Busiest park</p><p>The parks department doesn't track usage, but at about 400 acres, High Park is the biggest city park. Despite friction over which users should get priority, including cyclists versus motorists, you can find quiet forest shade even on busy summer days in the sprawling landmark that has its own pond, trails and zoo. You will find no privacy, and not much of anything really, in Toronto's smallest park - the St. Mary Street Parkette in the Yonge Street and Charles Street area. At 56 square metres, it is about 29,000 times smaller than High Park. But it has a water fountain.</p><p>4. Worst day for gridlock</p><p>We can't say for certain which day will see the worst traffic this summer but we can draw some inferences from last year. According to city analysis of data from HERE Technologies, Tuesday, June 27, had the worst gridlock of summer 2023. Trips on average took 2.3 times longer than if traffic were free-flowing. That day included a Blue Jays game, CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer at BMO Field, Collision tech conference at Exhibition Place, plus rain as well as forest fire smoke. Potential days to avoid the roads this summer include the July 20-21 weekend that is packed with events, including Honda Indy, South Asia Fest, Jays games and a Saturday concert at Budweiser Stage.</p><p>5. Biggest concert </p><p>and sporting events</p><p>According to ticket reseller StubHub, P!NK's Aug. 14 show at Rogers Centre will be this summer's hot seller, followed by Usher at Scotiabank Arena on Sept. 3 and, on July 13 at Rogers Centre, Punjabi singer-turned-actor Diljit Dosanjh. Other big StubHub sellers include the July 5 to 7 WWE Money in the Bank Weekend at Scotiabank Arena, and the Jays' July 1 to 4 stand against the Houston Astros.</p><p>6. Heaviest wastewater day</p><p>The sewer system's biggest non-storm day last summer was July 5 when frequent flushing pushed a combined total of 1,400 million litres per day of wastewater to the four treatment plants. The day was part of a heat wave that pushed humidex levels close to 40C, strained the city's electricity grid and, evidently, saw a lot of Torontonians try to stay hydrated.</p><p>7. A nicer smell, in the parks</p><p>People enjoying parks might not be able to name the blooms, but flowers definitely add to the experience. The city grows about one million plants annually in parks, gardens and conservatories. The most common flower is the Tuberous Begonia - with large, colourful and fragrant petals - numbering about 60,000 this year.</p><p>8. Noisiest patio</p><p>The patio that got the most noise complaints last summer, according to the city, was The Morning After restaurant on Fort York Boulevard, which was the subject of a dozen complaints. A manager said it remained open late to make up for pandemic losses, but this summer is usually closing at 4 p.m. It also has a louvred roof to minimize noise travelling up to surrounding CityPlace condos. The Star visited on a Friday afternoon and found neighbouring Hunters Landing patio - with European soccer commentary blaring from an outward-pointing speaker - much louder.</p><p>9. Ferry frustration</p><p>An unfortunate rite of passage is standing in a long, hot queue trying to get on a ferry to the Toronto islands. Over the past three summers, ferry demand has peaked over the Simcoe Day long weekend in early August. City staff said this year they are taking steps to lessen lineups - including getting more people to buy tickets online than at ferry kiosk terminals - but the eventual fix will be new electric ferries with greater carrying capacity.</p><p>10. Busiest LCBO day</p><p>No big surprise that June 30 - Canada Day eve - saw the biggest Toronto-area summer sales last year. The most popular summer drink orders through LCBO online were Cutwater Tequila Margarita, Ace Hill Lemon Vodka Soda and Ace Hill Raspberry Vodka Soda. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2024063071973364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CCF-88Y1-JDV5-F02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Conditions are expected to improve on Monday.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerable from hour to hour. <br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.<br/><br/> Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for Muskoka. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023062568300539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JJ-23F1-JDV5-F0MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Eventually, the fire came up against the reservoir itself. </p><p>According to Furey, the airstrip remains intact, as do the surrounding buildings. </p><p>At present, the fire is at a category two or three and remains approximately three kilometres away from the town. </p><p>Rain hopefully coming </p><p>Some rain has been predicted over the area, but it is still uncertain how much.   </p><p>While the lack of radar imagery in Labrador makes it difficult to track rain, simulated radar images show that it is raining in and near Churchill Falls. </p><p>There will be a chance of showers and drizzle on Thursday and possibly Friday, however, that likely won\u2019t lead to significant rain accumulation. Additionally, more widespread showers are possible on both Saturday and Sunday which could lead to greater amounts of rainfall. </p><p>There is continued bomber suppression. Up until mid-afternoon, there has been a limitation due to smoke and the low ceiling.  </p><p>Nonetheless, there remain eight bombers to perform the circuits, attacking the easterly edge in an effort to protect the town.  </p><p>Final evacuation </p><p>Jennifer Williams, president and chief executive officer of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, began her statement in today\u2019s media advisory by asking for patience and kindness, as last night was the second and final round of evacuees leaving Churchill Falls.  </p><p>\u201cThis is a really big deal for the people who are working on that facility,\u201d she said. </p><p>Williams emphasized the importance for everyone to take care of themselves, take care of others and be extra patient with one another at this heightened time. </p><p>\u201cIt became extra fresh last night because we had an evacuation before and then we had another host of people who left,\u201d she explained.  </p><p>Newfoundland Hydro is continuing to monitor the plant remotely. According to Williams, the monitoring is going well and there have been no challenges with the supply committed to customers. </p><p>Labrador West </p><p>As of 4:30 p.m., on June 26, Newfoundland Labrador Hydro announced that power had been restored for all customers in Labrador City.  </p><p>This afternoon they were able to re-energize one of the transmission lines from Churchill Falls and restore power for most customers in Wabush.  </p><p>However, as the wildfires continue, there remains a risk of additional power outages for all customers in Labrador. </p><p>Wabush and areas around Labrador City were experiencing an ongoing power outage due to a combination of smoke and water that caused a trip in the line going from Churchill Falls to Labrador West. </p><p>The citizens of Wabush remained without power for 24 hours. </p><p>\u201cAt around 3:30 p.m. today, Labrador time, they will be twenty-four hours without power,\u201d said Labrador West NDP MHA Jordan Brown. </p><p>The lack of power in Wabush has also resulted in a boil water advisory, as the community has lost the ability to chlorinate their water.  </p><p>Both Brown and Ron Barron, the mayor of Wabush, stated that a station will be available in Labrador City where people will be able to access potable water. </p><p>Numerous supports have also been available to the residents of Wabush, including meal services at the Labrador West Community Church and a local gym is open and preserving power in order to offer showers to residents. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of open arms from residents of Lab City and Wabush,\u201d said Brown. </p><p>Major Phyllis Blundell-Colbourne, from the Salvation Army Labrador West Community Church, said they provided lunch for approximately 40 people. </p><p>Supper was also provided by the church to around 60 residents, and they will continue to provide food to residents as the power comes back on. </p><p>\u201cNow, the power is back in Wabush, as far as we can understand,\u201d said Colbourne. \u201cBut we posted on Facebook that we still had the food as it was donated and wanted people to come by for conversation, and a little bit of fellowship.\u201d  </p><p>Flick the switch </p><p>According to both Furey and Williams, once there was a safe window, the ideal solution was to reset the breakers back in Churchill Falls by flying people in from Goose Bay to do the necessary checks on the ground and attempt the reset. </p><p>Although there is no guarantee that this could work. </p><p>While Hydro wanted to simply go back in and reset the line, they had been researching alternative solutions. </p><p>\u201cEven if we choose to re-establish that line\u2013 we would have to make sure that Fermont and Lab City are protected from that re-energization,\u201d explained Williams. </p><p>One solution could be bringing in new supply, which is not a short-term fix and is not feasible within the next 24 hours, explained Williams.  </p><p>Hydro was also looking into technical modifications in the field to make that happen; to potentially direct some of the Fermont power into Wabush.  </p><p>However, research must first be conducted in order to ensure that there are no power quality issues for the community. </p><p>\u201cOne station is not equivalent, necessarily to another station,\u201d explained Williams. </p><p>Finding a match </p><p>While the Fermont power is a good match for the Labrador City station, it is not a good match for the existing infrastructure and protection settings in Wabush. </p><p>\u201cElectricity is incredibly dangerous and we have to be very thoughtful and careful about how we choose then to implement any solutions that may indeed be possible,\u201d said Williams. </p><p>While the power may now be restored, the uncertainty of the wildfires and their effects on surrounding communities continues to shift daily. </p><p>For now, the waiting game continues, as shifting conditions determine both Hydro and the government\u2019s next move. </p><p>\u201cWe are still at the mercy of Mother Nature,\u201d said Williams.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e4645531785e4a129303f4092ed465fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH8-N1W1-DY9S-T2D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><timeReceived>12:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 17, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The comments come a day after U.S. president Joe Biden put forward a proposed peace deal between Israel and Hamas that seeks to enact a three-phase wind-down of the war. Israel's government says putting a permanent ceasefire in place before the conditions are fulfilled is a \"non-starter.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1 - The African National Congress party loses its parliamentary majority in a historic election result. It puts South Africa on a new political path for the first time since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago. With 99 per cent of votes counted, the African National Congress party receives just over 40 per cent.</p><p>2 - Defence Minister Bill Blair says he expressed Canada's concerns about Beijing's foreign interference when he met with his Chinese counterpart. It's the first face-to-face meeting of Canadian and Chinese defence ministers in 11 years. Blair met with Admiral Dong Jun on Friday while attending an international security conference in Singapore. Blair says he also brought up China's financial and economic support for Russia as well as its recent military exercises in Taiwan.</p><p>2 - The Edmonton Oilers are going to the Stanley Cup final for the first time in nearly two decades. The Oilers cap an improbable run to the Stanley Cup Final Sunday night by beating the Dallas Stars 2-1. Edmonton wins the Western Conference in six games and will now play for the Cup for the first time since 2006. They'll head to Florida for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final in a series set to open on Saturday night.</p><p>3 - Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum will become the first woman president in the country's 200-year history. The climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor has won Mexico's presidential election, a turning point in a mostly conservative country that for more than two centuries has been exclusively ruled by men. Mexican women won the right to vote in 1953.</p><p>3 - The University of Manitoba publicly apologizes for harm it caused to First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities more than a century after it began accepting and storing Indigenous remains. The school says it inappropriately accepted and stored ancestral remains as well as burial belongings and cultural artifacts without consent from Indigenous communities. University president Michael Benarroch says the school's founding members desecrated graves and mishandled remains starting in the 1890s. The university started working to repatriate remains four years ago. </p><p>3 - The pharmacare bill is headed to the Senate after passing in the House of Commons. The Liberals' bill sets the stage for a future full-fledged universal pharmacare program and would see the federal government offer first-payer coverage of some contraceptive and diabetes medications.</p><p>4 - Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims victory for his coalition alliance and promises India will see a new chapter of big decisions in his third term in office. Despite a lacklustre performance from his party, instead of the landslide he expected, Modi tells a crowd at party headquarters he will push forward with his agenda. </p><p>5 - A British museum is returning a ceremonial headdress to a First Nation in Alberta. The Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, England, is to return the Buffalo Woman's headdress to representatives of the Siksika Blackfoot First Nation. The handover will take place in a ceremony at the museum today. It received the headdress in 1920 from Edgar Dewdney, a former governor of the Northwest Territories from which Alberta and Saskatchewan were carved. </p><p>5 - The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate a quarter point to 4.75 per cent. The first rate cut in more than four years comes as good news for would-be first time homebuyers and people with variable rate mortgages. Governor Tiff Macklem says the central bank has more confidence inflation is moving closer to its two per cent target and that if inflation continues to slow, it is reasonable to expect further rate cuts. But he says those decisions will be taken one meeting at a time.</p><p>5 - \"Self-Portrait in the Zone of Silence,'' written in Spanish by Homero Aridjis and translated into English by Canadian writer George McWhirter, wins the Griffin Poetry Prize. The $130,000 award was announced at a ceremony in Toronto, though Aridjis was not able to attend after undergoing medical treatments. Jurors praised the use of mythical imagery to examine emotional realities and the presentation of \"a rounded human being engaged with total experience.'' </p><p>6 - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uses his speech to veterans at Juno Beach on the 80th anniversary of D-Day to talk about democracy still being still under threat. Thirteen Canadian veterans, including one who is 104 years old, took part in the ceremony in Courseulles-sur-Mer, France. Trudeau said the world owes it to the veterans who sacrificed so much for our collective freedom to continue standing up for democracy every day. After observing a moment of silence, Trudeau, the French prime minister and Prince William walked to a sand dune and laid commemorative wreaths. </p><p>6 - The world's largest and most powerful rocket blasts off from Texas, soaring above the Gulf of Mexico and heading east. The fourth flight of SpaceX\u2019s mega Starship rocket was successful and returned to Earth in one piece. NASA and Elon Musk are counting on Starship to get humans to the moon and Mars. Last year\u2019s two test flights ended in explosions shortly after takeoff. </p><p>6 - Nova Scotia announces it is joining Ontario, Quebec and B.C. in restricting cellphone use in schools, starting this fall. Public school students will have to turn off their phones and other personal electronic devices during classroom hours and store them out of sight. New Brunswick is also imposing restrictions in September. </p><p>6 - Ontario Premier Doug Ford is shakes things up with a cabinet shuffle as the provincial legislature heads into its summer break. Education Minister Stephen Lecce and Energy Minister Todd Smith are swapping portfolios. Lecce had been education minister since 2019 while Smith had the energy portfolio for the past three years. Several new people have been promoted into cabinet, with new associate minister positions being created and some other ministries, such as Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, being split into two. </p><p>6 - Residents in Calgary are directed to avoid taking showers or baths, while some are told to boil their water as the city grapples with a major water main break. The 1.6 million people living in the city had an emergency notice issued due to a water main break in the city's northwest, where water flooded streets and snarled traffic. Director of water services Nancy MacKay says while water main breaks are common in the city, the size of this one is unprecedented. City officials said they couldn't predict how long the water main repair would take or how long water restrictions might last. </p><p>7 - Canadian businessman and billionaire Frank Stronach is arrested and charged in connection with a sexual-assault investigation. Police west of Toronto say the 91-year-old founder and former chief executive of auto parts manufacturing giant Magna International faces five charges, including rape, indecent assault on a female, forcible confinement and sexual assault. The alleged incidents took place between the 1980s and 2023. Stronach is released on conditions and is set to appear in court July 8. He denies the charges. </p><p>7 - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is formally elected leader of the National Democratic Alliance coalition, which won the most seats in the national election. The 73-year-old will now form a coalition government and be sworn in as prime minister for a rare third term. This is the first time under Modi's leadership that the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has needed support from its regional allies to form a government.</p><p>8 - Israel rescues four hostages who were kidnapped in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. It marks the largest hostage recovery operation since the latest war with Hamas began in Gaza. The Israeli army says it rescued three people in their 20s and a 40-year-old in a complex special daytime operation in Nuseirat. Israel says more than 130 hostages remain -- with about a quarter of those believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says 274 people were killed in the operation. </p><p>8 - Montreal residents enjoy the newly restored city hall for the first time in five years as the historic building reopens to the public. Visitors are seen waiting in long lines around the revamped heritage building, waiting for their chance to see what $211 million in upgrades look like. The project to restore the building began in 2019 \u2013 with the cost sitting at almost double the original projections. </p><p>9 - A four-alarm fire rips through St. Anne's Anglican Church in Toronto, severely damaging a national historic site and several murals by the Group of Seven. The rector of the church confirms the early paintings by three Group of Seven members were in the part of the church destroyed by the blaze. The paintings had been installed in the 1920s. </p><p>9 - French President Emanuel Macron dissolves his country's National Assembly and calls a snap legislative election after his party suffers a heavy defeat in European Parliament elections. The first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union's parliamentary election, defeating Macron's pro-European centrists. The vote for France's National Assembly will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7. </p><p>9 - The federal government says a new change to the capital-gains tax will take effect on June 25, regardless of whether legislation has passed. The change would apply to all capital gains by businesses but individuals would only face the higher inclusion rate on capital gains of more than $250,000. The Liberal government plans to take legislative steps on increasing the inclusion rate on capital gains, with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland saying it will improve tax fairness for Canadians. The government has proposed to make two-thirds of capital gains taxable. </p><p>9 - Reverend James Lawson Junior, an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutality from white authorities during the Civil Rights Movement, dies at the age of 95 after a short illness in Los Angeles. Lawson was a close adviser to the Reverend Martin Luther King Junior. </p><p>10 - A Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois motion is introduced in Parliament calling on the government to broaden a public inquiry into foreign interference so it addresses allegations some MPs \"wittingly'' participated in meddling. That bombshell claim was included in a report released the previous week by Parliament's national security committee. The Conservatives and NDP have both penned letters to Democratic Institutions Minister Dominic LeBlanc, saying the inquiry must be asked to report on the allegations. </p><p>10 - The UN Security Council approves its first resolution endorsing a ceasefire plan to try to end the eight-month war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The U.S.-sponsored resolution welcomes a ceasefire proposal announced by President Joe Biden. The U.S. says Israel has accepted it and Hamas says it welcomes the resolution and is ready to work with mediators. The resolution was approved by 14 of the 15 Security Council members, calling on Israel and Hamas to fully implement its terms without delay and without conditions.</p><p>11 - The UN human rights office is citing possible war crimes by Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in connection with a deadly raid Saturday by Israeli forces that freed four hostages in Gaza. Office spokesman Jeremy Laurence expressed concerns about possible violations of rules of proportionality, distinction and precaution by Israel in the raid at a refugee camp. Gaza health officials say at least 274 Palestinians, including dozens of women and children, were killed in the operation. Laurence said Palestinian armed groups holding hostages in densely populated areas are putting the lives of civilians and the hostages at \"added risks.\" </p><p>11 - A Delaware jury finds Hunter Biden guilty on all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018. The U.S. president's son faces up to 25 years in prison for being found guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. </p><p>11 - A controversial motion increasing the proportion of capital gains that are taxed passes in the House of Commons by a vote of 208-118. The Conservatives vote against the motion, issuing a statement saying the party opposed what it called a \"job-killing tax on health care, homes, farms and small business.\" The Liberals say they are increasing capital-gains taxes to help pay for investments in health care, housing and clean technology. The change will take effect June 25. </p><p>12 - Manitoba's NDP approves a plan to search a Winnipeg landfill for the bodies of two murdered women. Premier Wab Kinew says the province wasn't able to provide details before now because of the ongoing court case against the women's admitted killer. Kinew says he met with the families of the murdered women to explain the province's plans. Manitoba's former Progressive Conservative government refused to search the landfill, saying the toxic materials buried there would be dangerous for searchers. </p><p>12 - The children who survived the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut graduate from Newtown High School. Many of them will walk across the stage with a heavy heart, remembering the 20 first-grade classmates they lost in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. </p><p>12 - A Royal Canadian Geographical Society team has found the wreck of Irish explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Quest about 80 kilometres off Labrador. The 47-year-old was on his way to explore parts of Antarctica when he died aboard the ship in 1922. Sonar scans located the wreck and the expedition leader says it is in incredible condition, other than having a broken mast. A crew is going to head out to capture images of the wreck using remotely operated vehicles. </p><p>13 - New regulations are announced that will take effect in B.C. starting right after Labour Day to set minimum-wage and basic protections for ride-hailing and delivery workers using platforms like Uber, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. The province's labour ministry says the rules will address the top concerns of workers at app-based platforms, including low and unpredictable pay, tip protection and lack of workers' compensation. </p><p>13 - Fox Sports acquires the rights to broadcast IndyCar starting next year. The network already broadcasts the first half of the NASCAR schedule but the move will give it two of the biggest races in the world with the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Daytona 500. Fox Sports said all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app. </p><p>13 - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other G7 leaders take action on Day One of their summit in Italy to reinforce their solidarity with Ukraine. The leaders cleared the way for a US$50-billion loan package for Kyiv that Canada will pump $5 billion into. U.S. President Joe Biden is also preparing to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both moves are intended to show Russian President Vladimir Putin that the world's leading industrialized democracies are standing behind Ukraine. </p><p>13 - Thirty-five Global News jobs are cut across Canada. Unifor says some of its members were laid off in major cities in Alberta, Ontario and B.C. as part of changes recently announced by Corus Entertainment. Those positions cut are on top of 11 Unifor members at Global who were already laid off this year. The union calls it a devastating blow to the industry, adding the jobs are desperately needed in the country. </p><p>13 - Tesla shareholders vote to restore CEO Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year. The vote sends out a strong show of confidence in Musk's leadership of the electric vehicle maker. The package will likely remain stuck in Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months, meaning the money won't move despite the win. </p><p>14 - Muslim pilgrims converge on a vast tent camp set up in the desert near Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to officially begin the annual Hajj. Saudi officials say more than 1.5 million foreign pilgrims have arrived in Mecca so far and they expect the total this year to surpass the more than 1.8 million people who took part in the annual holy pilgrimage last year. It is mandatory for the Muslim faithful to take the trip to Mecca and take part in the Hajj at least once in a lifetime. </p><p>14 - Before flying to speak at the G7 summit in southern Italy about artificial intelligence, Pope Francis welcomes more than 100 of the world's top comedians to the Vatican to celebrate the importance of humour. He told Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Rock, Stephen Colbert, Conan O'Brien and others that in the midst of so much gloomy news, they have the power to spread peace and smiles. He asked the entertainers to remember that when they manage to bring intelligent smiles to the lips of even a single spectator, they also make God smile. </p><p>14 - Cicada chaos flourishes as trillions of crawling cicada nymphs that have spent 17 years underground shed their skin and emerge as adults. They're red-eyed, loud and frisky. Biologist Gene Kritsky estimates as many as five million cicadas crowded into a small patch of Ryerson Conservation Area north of Chicago, where the males are singing for sex. They won't stop until they get a female cicada's flapping wing consent, which is pushing decibel readings to 101 -- louder than a lawnmower. </p><p>14 - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi releases a photo of himself shaking hands with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit. It's the first time the two have met in person since Trudeau accused Modi's government of being involved in the killing of a Sikh activist in British Columbia. </p><p>14 - Scientists in British Columbia call it a \"landmark day\" for Caribou conservation efforts, as the province moves forward with a massive park expansion. A major provincial park expansion will create a nearly 2,000-square-kilometre protection zone for caribou and other species in northeastern British Columbia. The addition to the Klinse-za Park will make it the largest provincial park established in the province in a decade. The park addition is the result of a 2020 partnership between the province and the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations to help stabilize and protect the threatened southern mountain caribou. </p><p>15 - An RCMP officer working undercover at a protest in Alberta faces accusations of using flirtatious tactics to get information from a suspect. The lawyer for Anthony Olienick pointed to text messages containing heart emojis exchanged between the officer and his client.  The officer, however, maintains she wasn't flirting as undercover investigators are prohibited from using seduction to gather information. Olienick, along with Chris Carbert, is on trial for allegedly conspiring to kill police officers during the 2022 Coutts border blockade. </p><p>15 - The Princess of Wales makes her first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis earlier this year, joining other royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony at the end of the King\u2019s Birthday Parade. The family and crowds outside the palace are observing a flyby of military aircraft to cap off ceremonies marking the monarch\u2019s official birthday. </p><p>15 - The City of Calgary declares a state of emergency. Calgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek signs the paperwork to declare the local emergency, following an investigation into a burst water main. Yesterday officials revealed work to repair the broken pipe is expected to take three to five more weeks. Gondek is reiterating a plea for residents and businesses to reduce water usage during the crisis, saying the city reached its maximum threshold of 480 million litres used yesterday.</p><p>15 - Israel says eight of its soldiers have been killed in the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in months. The eight were killed in an explosion in southern Gaza, but the military did not elaborate. The deaths will likely fuel calls for a ceasefire and heighten Israeli public anger over ultra-Orthodox exemptions from the military. </p><p>15 - Manitoba residents fill a park in Dauphin for the unveiling of a new monument, honouring the 17 victims of a deadly bus crash that took place one year ago. Family members of the 17 victims who died in the crash spearheaded efforts to create a dedicated space where the public can pay their respects.  The large, black monument bears a written description of the events of June 15, 2023, along with a list of the people killed and those who survived. </p><p>16 - The second bridge connecting Windsor, Ont., and Detroit, Mich., officially becomes an international crossing. Construction crews complete the installation of the final two edge girders that link the Gordie Howe Bridge on both sides of the border. In 2012, former prime minister Stephen Harper announced the construction of the bridge, the cost of which has since risen to $6.4 billion. Construction was pushed back several times due to disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the crossing's official opening is slated for next year. </p><p>16 - Officials in the Northwest Territories community of Fort Good Hope order an evacuation due to an encroaching wildfire. A late-night update from the territorial government says some five evacuation flights have already completed 16 trips, shepherding 240 people to Norman Wells, about 140 kilometres away. Another evacuation centre is set up in Inuvik, and a flight is scheduled to go there from Norman Wells this morning for evacuees who require hosting supports.</p><p>16 - Speaking in Switzerland, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Russia needs to be accountable for \"an element of genocide'' the country is committing by taking Ukrainian kids. Trudeau makes the comments at a peace summit, largely seen as a symbolic effort by Kyiv to rally the international community to Ukraine's cause. More than 90 countries are attending the weekend summit. A joint statement is signed by most of the nations participating calling for the \"territorial integrity'' of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement. </p><p>17 - Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved Israel's influential War Cabinet that was tasked with steering the war in Gaza. The move comes just days after the departure from the government of Benny Gantz, an opposition lawmaker who had joined the coalition in the early days of the war. The officials say that going forward, Netanyahu will hold smaller forums with some of his government members for sensitive issues. </p><p>17 - Weekly insulin injections could soon be a way of life for many Canadians with diabetes, replacing daily shots. Drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk says Insulin icodec is the first once-a-week-basal insulin injection in the world \u2013 and Canada is the first country to get the product under the brand name Awiqli. It will be available later this month.

According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre the total area burned last year reached an unprecedented 17,347,637 hectares, marking the highest in 40 years. This staggering amount is over six times the average area burned annually over the past decade, highlighting the escalating intensity and scale of these events. British Columbia and Alberta bore the brunt of forest fires, with BC experiencing 2,840,754 hectaresburned, a 2,004% increase over the previous year. Alberta also faced significant devastation, witnessing an 8,814% rise in burned area to 1,951,299 hectares.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recognizing the critical need to address this growing threat and its implications for home insurance, MyChoice, a leading insurance comparison website, has initiated an internal case study to identify regions at heightened risk of wildfires in 2024.</p><p>To identify the cities most at risk of wildfires, we used two key metrics across the critical fire season months from May to September: the Forecast Severity Rating (FSR) and the Forecast Severity Anomaly (FSA)   both retrieved from the Monthly and Seasonal forecastby the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System. The FSR measures the predicted conditions for wildfire severity, scored from 1 to 5, where 1 represents low risk and 5 represents extreme risk. The FSA, on the other hand, compares the forecasted severity to the historical average, also scored from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates well below average conditions and 5 indicates well above average conditions. The overall risk score for each city was determined by combining the equally weighted average of the two metrics from May to September, providing a comprehensive assessment of wildfire risk.</p><p>Kamloops, BC, tops the list with a risk score of 9.4/10, indicating extreme wildfire risk due to its high Forecast Severity Rating and well above average Forecast Severity Anomaly. Other cities such as Saskatoon, SK (8.8), Regina, SK (8.6), and Kelowna, BC (8.6) also show significantly elevated wildfire risks, making them areas of concern for the upcoming season.</p><p>Most cities in Ontario remain relatively safe compared to the rest of Canada, with only a few northern cities, such as Timmins and Kenora, falling into the higher risk category for wildfires. It comes with no surprise that the home insurance prices are rising across the provinces most affected by wildfires. According to the most recent CPI data, Manitoba saw the highest year-over-year home insurance inflation in April 2024 at 14.2%, followed by Alberta at 11.4% and Saskatchewan at 11.0%. British Columbia experienced a 10.7% increase, while Ontario had the lowest rise at 7.5%. These inflation rates imply that there is a growing financial impact of increased wildfire risk on home insurance premiums.</p><p>\"While we are seeing insurance companies in the U.S. pulling out of high-risk areas due to the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires, especially in California, the situation in Canada remains different,\" said Aren Mirzaian, CEO of MyChoice. \"In Canada, the insurance market has shown resilience, and we have not yet reached the point where insurers are withdrawing coverage. However, the unprecedented scale of wildfires last year is a clear warning signal. We need to be proactive in understanding the risks and ensuring that Canadian home insurance offerings are robust enough to provide adequate coverage in these challenging times.\"</p><p>If you live in the areas identified in our study as high risk for wildfires, you should consider getting a comprehensive home insurance policy that includes coverage for fire damage, additional living expenses, and emergency evacuation. Make sure your policy provides replacement cost coverage, which will cover the cost of rebuilding your home to a similar size and quality, and includes contents insurance to replace your personal belongings.</p><p>About MyChoice</p><p>MyChoice is a premier rate comparison resource that offers Canadians the lowest auto, home and life insurance rates quickly and conveniently from the comfort of their home.

Girard would only commit on Tuesday to balancing the budget by the 2029-30 fiscal year \u2014 two years later than he had forecast 12 months ago.</p><p>Quebecers will have to wait for the government\u2019s plan to erase the deficit, he said, because \u201cwe think the economic conditions will be better next year.\u201d</p><p>The province\u2019s real GDP \u2014 adjusted for inflation \u2014 grew by 0.2 per cent in 2023, and the budget predicts it will increase by 0.6 per cent in 2024 and by 1.6 per cent in 2025.</p><p>\u201cThe economy is currently stopped,\u201d Girard told reporters in Quebec City, adding that if the Bank of Canada cuts interest rates \u2014 something he said he expects in the second half of 2024 \u2014 then growth will accelerate. \u201cIf there\u2019s rain this summer, if there\u2019s water in Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s reservoirs, if (electricity) exports restart,\u201d he said, he\u2019ll be in a better position to figure out when and how the books will eventually be balanced.</p><p>Aside from the sluggish economy, Girard says the province\u2019s revenues took a hit from dry weather conditions last summer, which led to a historic fire season and reduced water levels in the electric utility\u2019s reservoirs, leaving the provincially run corporation with less power to sell. In its annual report earlier this year, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec said its annual dividend to the provincial government dropped to $2.5 billion in 2023, from $3.3 billion the year before.</p><p>As well, Girard said, strikes in the public sector \u2014 which for weeks last year shut down schools and delayed surgeries \u2014 resulted in salary increases that added $3 billion in annual expenses.</p><p>Eleven billion dollars, he admitted, could be the largest deficit ever recorded in Quebec. However, he said, governments in the 1990s recorded bigger deficits as a percentage of the province\u2019s GDP. In the 2020-21 fiscal year, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, government spending exceeded revenues by $10.7 billion, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20240313RDA0004250176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJ8-7SK1-F0HF-80W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

Gen. Theodoros Vagias, to coincide with International Day of Forests on March 21.</p><p>\u201cThis is a big fight for us. It\u2019s climate crisis, it's a time of need,\u201d Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said, speaking at the presentation. \"We\u2019re going to have a huge effort this summer to do the best of what we can do, to the best of our abilities, in order to be able to protect Greeks, protect tourists, protect their houses, and protect, of course, the wildlife and our forests.\" </p><p>The changes include having water-dropping aircraft take off in the initial stages of the outbreak of a wildfire instead of waiting for a request for air support from ground firefighting crews once the blaze has already spread, and having more fire trucks deploy in the initial stages of any wildfire.</p><p>The number of specialized forest firefighting crews will increase from six to 16, including 10 that will be able to deploy rapidly by aircraft, while forestry units will be deployed on the ground with firefighters for better coordination during fires.</p><p>Greece is also seeking to increase its water-dropping aircraft fleet with seven new Canadair planes over the next few years. The aircraft are the main means of aerial firefighting used in Greece and several other European countries, and Greek lawmakers were expected to approve a bill Thursday regarding the purchase.</p><p>The procurement is for five new planes with a six-ton water capacity, along with two additional aircraft to be obtained through the European Union\u2019s civil protection RescEU program that assists member states in the handling of disasters, government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis said Thursday.</p><p>Marinakis said the first two planes would be delivered to Greece in 2027, one more in 2028 and another in 2029, with the remaining three arriving in 2030.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is scheduled to travel to Canada on Sunday for meetings that are expected to include the signing of the Canadair deal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-92f01ce87b0a36bde29cba0479bc5f30</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BM4-3MX1-DY9S-T0C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><timeReceived>11:18 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 21, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

100 of those jobs permanent in an effort to recruit and retain more workers.</p><p>But the union representing those fire rangers says it's little more than a drop in the bucket and will not fix the \"dire and ongoing crisis.\"</p><p>Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Graydon Smith says the province wants more people fighting wildland fires and is planning a recruitment blitz ahead of the start of the wildfire season that begins in April.</p><p>The majority of the 660 forest firefighters in the province are part-timers and the union representing them has long said that part-time work, along with low pay, are major problems in retaining them.</p><p>Smith says the government is working on longer-term plans to stabilize the workforce, which will include the purchase of new equipment, including water bombers.</p><p>Premier Doug Ford says Ontario plans to buy new water bombers, but says the manufacturers cannot build them fast enough.</p><p>Canada had its worst wildfire season ever last year and Smith says they are seeing more fires per year in Ontario over the last decade.</p><p>\"We want to have more people fighting wildland fires in Ontario and so this is a recruitment and retention tool, both,\" Smith said in an interview. </p><p>\"It's a tight labour market out there and it can be challenging and we also want to keep them around and we want to keep that knowledge in the system.\"</p><p>Smith said a robust forest fire ranger program will also allow the province to help other provinces and territories.</p><p>More than 500 Ontario fire rangers fought blazes in British Columbia and Northwest Territories last year.</p><p>The province will also give one-time $1,000 bonuses to unionized wildland firefighting support staff.</p><p>The Ontario Public Service Employees Union said the government has ignored wildland firefighters' recommendations to fix the staffing crisis.</p><p>\"Instead of being proactive and focusing on real solutions \u2014 like recognizing wildland fire workers for the work they do and compensating them properly, or ensuring they have the coverage they need for the risks they face \u2014 this government is choosing PR stunts,\u201d JP Hornick, president of the union, said in a statement.</p><p>\"They\u2019re more concerned about suppressing criticism than protecting our air quality and human life.\"</p><p>Hornick said the union accepted the one-time bonus, but added it was \"a take-it or leave-it, one-sided decision.\"</p><p>There were more than 700 forest fires in Ontario last year that burned 441,000 hectares of forest, three times the average over 10 years.</p><p>Researchers have warned that it will likely be another tough year, with widespread droughts, early snowmelt and lower-than-usual precipitation through the winter.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 21, 2024. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Broomfield Arena will accommodate evacuees, marking\u00a0the town's second time accepting residents forced to evacuate due to\u00a0wildfires in less than a month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The only way to go is to go east,\" said Adams in a Facebook video. \"We cannot go the other way, we have to go east. So pack up your vehicles and go, and take essentials only.\"</p><p>On June 19, more than 750 residents from Churchill Falls went to\u00a0Happy Valley-Goose Bay as wildfires put the community at risk.</p><p>\"It's just been a very difficult beginning of summer,\" said George Andrews, the mayor of Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>With the entirety of Labrador City travelling East, Andrews said the town is prepared to see its population almost double. He feels its important to help, because Happy Valley-Goose Bay could find itself in a similar situation.</p><p>\"To be honest with you, when I hear our sirens kick in town, I get stomach sick because I think it's a fire situation. When I look at the ambulance going down the road, I kind of breath that sigh of relief.\"</p><p>With the smell of smoke in the air from another wildfire in the region, in combination with hot and dry temperatures, Andrews wants to see the rest of the summer filled with rain.</p><p>\"We hope that this incident will wrap up quickly. We can help where we can. And then I personally hope it rains for the rest of the summer.\"</p><p>The provincial government says the fire has the potential to grow significantly closer to Labrador West over the next 24 to 48 hours. Neighbouring Wabush is under an evacuation alert, with residents advised to be ready to leave at a moment's notice.</p><p>The provincial government is advising residents to stay updated via media reports.</p><p>Tacora Resources has suspended operations at the Scully Mine site north of Wabush until conditions improve. On X, formerly Twitter, Premier Andrew Furey advised the town's residents of Wabush to also stay alert.</p><p>\"An evacuation order is in place for the Town of Labrador City due of the status of the wildfire burning in western Labrador. Residents of Wabush are asked to remain vigilant as conditions can change. Check on your family, friends and neighbours, and please stay safe,\" Furey said.</p><p>The fire threatening Labrador West is one of three wildfires threatening communities in Labrador.\u00a0</p><p>Earlier Friday,\u00a0residents\u00a0were\u00a0warned to stay\u00a0on guard.</p><p>There are currently 11 fires in the region, one of them near Wabush and Labrador City in western Labrador and another near Happy Valley-Goose Bay in central Labrador, with smoke\u00a0affecting visibility on roads and rail lines.</p><p>Continued hot and dry conditions in the forecast set to potentially make them worse.</p><p>Shortly after 4:30 p.m. AT Friday,\u00a0Wabush\u00a0and Labrador City\u00a0invoked its emergency operations centre and warned residents of a\u00a0potential evacuation.</p><p>In a Facebook video, Wabush Mayor Ron Barron said they'll update residents as quickly as possible using its crisis management system and the town's Facebook page.</p><p>\"If necessary, we will go door to door,\" said Barron, who said the last time the town had to evacuate\u00a0due to wildfires was 2013.</p><p>Duley Lake Cabin &amp; Camping and Walsh River Cabin areas near Labrador City have been evacuated.</p><p>The fire threatening Labrador West is moving fast, about 50 metres per minute, said provincial forest fire duty officer Jeff Motty earlier Friday afternoon.</p><p>\"It's covering a fair bit of ground quickly,\" Motty said.</p><p>With its quick escalation, it's no longer safe to have\u00a0water bombers on the\u00a0fire. Motty said they have been pulled back for the time being.</p><p>Resources from New Brunswick are coming in to help protect critical infrastructure including highways, railways and campgrounds.</p><p>A third fire is burning near Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, an Inuit community on Labrador's north coast of Labrador.</p><p>All three fires of concern are deemed out of control on Newfoundland and Labrador's wildfire dashboard.</p><p>\"We're in dire need of a good dose of water in Labrador,\" .</p><p>CBC N.L. meteorologist Ashley Brauweiler said Saturday will be dry throughout the day with temperatures in the mid-20s C but there is potential for rain.</p><p>\"There is a slight chance of showers tonight for Lab West and early tomorrow morning for Happy Valley-Goose Bay, but the best chance of rain will be Sunday and Monday,\" Brauweiler said.</p><p>With rain comes the risk of thunderstorms. In the past week, lightning strikes have sparked more fires.</p><p>\"When conditions are dry in the forest and you get lightning moving through the areas, it's really easy for the forest to be ignited by Mother Nature,\" Motty said earlier Friday.</p><p>Brauweiler said next week looks cooler with more rain in the forecast.</p><p>A break in hot and dry temperatures would be welcomed by fire crews. Motty expects current weather conditions near Happy Valley-Goose Bay will allow what's known as the Lower Brook fire to grow and produce a lot of smoke.</p><p>He's unsure how far the fire is from the town but says it's close enough to be of concern.</p><p>Motty said the province is ready to ask for firefighting resources from other provinces.</p><p/><p>\"If we need more resources, it's only a quick email.\"</p><p>So far, the provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Saskatchewan have helped in Labrador's firefighting efforts. Motty said they've since been demobilized but there are plans to bring some crews back.</p><p>\"We've got strong partnerships that help us when we need the help,\" said Motty.</p><p>Residents can stay updated on the status of wildfires and evacuation measures through the news and social media, said Motty, who also suggests residents visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://firesmartcanada.ca/\">Fire Smart Canada's website</url> to learn how to help protect their home and pack for an evacuation if necessary.</p><p>\"We're just at the point we're kind of notifying communities that based on the best science available, we're anticipating growth on these fires.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Download our </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/newsapp/\">free CBC News app</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador. </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador\">Click here to visit our landing page</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanewfoundlandlabradorwabushlabradorcityfirethreat17261579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CG1-1M21-F03F-K11D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1018\"/><timeReceived>11:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

The decision came even though there were 161 fire emergencies in First Nations across Canada, producing 93 evacuations. In the B.C. Interior, the majority of the 54 First Nations still don\u2019t have anyone in the emergency co-ordinator position. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some suggest that emergency management co-ordinators are essential to ensure a smoother and better-organized community response and recovery if disaster strikes. In reporting last wildfire season, Canada\u2019s National Observer discussed the importance of the role with Andrea Stelter, emergency program co-ordinator for Skwl\u0101x te Secwepemcu\u0301l\u0313ecw. </p><p>She explained how she chased funding that led to training and more firefighting equipment and developed plans to protect culturally significant artifacts. Her strategy also protected important IT and computer infrastructure for band workers, allowing the First Nation\u2019s administration to return to work on the rebuild quickly. She also helped with damage assessment following the wildfire that destroyed 34 structures in Skwl\u0101x. </p><p>\u201cWhen I took on this position two years ago, I wanted to demonstrate the difference in recovery ... that you have when you have somebody dedicated to this position,\u201d Stelter said in a previous interview. </p><p>First Nations without the position are not so lucky. Many of them are relying on administrative staff who need to work on emergency management and preparedness, while also applying for essential grants off the side of their desks, Stelter told Canada\u2019s National Observer. </p><p>James Moxon, director general for Indigenous Services Canada (ISC), told Canada\u2019s National Observer in a media briefing that only 13 of 203 First Nations in British Columbia have an ISC-supported co-ordinator position. Moxon also said there was one co-ordinator in the Yukon. </p><p>Last wildfire season saw 68 per cent of the Northwest Territories' population displaced by wildfires, including several First Nations. K\u2019atl\u2019odeeche First Nation, for example, was evacuated twice, with the first evacuation taking place following Mother\u2019s Day. </p><p>Canada\u2019s National Observer asked how many emergency co-ordinators were in the Northwest Territories, but the department didn\u2019t get back in time for publication. </p><p>Otttawa is ensuring advance payments are available to First Nations who need support ahead of this year's wildfire season, Jennifer Kozelj, press secretary of Minister of Indigenous Services Canada Patty Hajdu, said in a statement. </p><p>There are now 253 emergency management coordinators across Canada; in addition, ISC-trained employees are equipped to support emergency management responses in First Nations if surge capacity strikes, she added. </p><p>\"ISC will be there to ensure no community is left behind before, during or after a disaster strikes,\" Kozelj said. </p><p>So far, the start of the 2024 wildfire season is looking better than last year's, however, the risk remains high with drought conditions across Canada\u2019s West. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported around 90 fires burning as of noon Thursday, including 12 classified as out of control. </p><p>Just over 176 square kilometres have burned so far, said Julienne Morissette, director of wildland fire research for Natural Resources Canada. The number is well below the 25-year average of 510 square kilometres.  </p><p>Morissette points to colder weather, a longer thaw and more precipitation than last year. However, hotter temperatures on the horizon coupled with drought make human-made and even lightning-caused fires a possibility.  </p><p>\u201cThat is why we urge Canadians to follow the restrictions of local authorities,\u201d Morissette said.  </p><p>Of the current fires, 40 are burning in Alberta, 24 in British Columbia and 10 in Manitoba. Four fires in New Brunswick are the only ones in Atlantic Canada, while Ontario has two and Quebec one. </p><p>\u2014 With files from Mia Robson / The Canadian Press</p><p>Matteo Cimellaro / Canada\u2019s National Observer / Local Journalism Initiative </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a4fb82cda2aa4e8c912ceaf4f08c1322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0S-MKD1-DY9S-T10K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>07:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 10, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Conservatives and Leader John Rustad, who says climate change isn't a crisis.</p><p>Weaver said he had concerns about Premier David Eby, whose New Democrats he helped put in power in 2017, as well as the exit of almost a dozen New Democrat representatives ahead of the fall vote.</p><p>Cabinet stalwarts Bruce Ralston, Harry Bains and Rob Fleming have all recently announced they will not seek re-election.</p><p>\"It told me something very sick is going on when literally the entire team from the 2017 to 2020 period is moving on,\" said Weaver.</p><p>\"It does not bode well for society when you have a tightly controlled central government.\"</p><p>Eby weighed in Friday, saying it was \"bizarre\" Weaver might favour Rustad, who was ejected by Opposition Leader Kevin Falcon from the former BC Liberals, the centre-right party now known as BC United, because of his views on climate change.</p><p>\"Yes, I don't know, I must have, like, budged in line at the legislature dining room or something in front of Mr. Weaver,\" said Eby at an unrelated news conference. \"He doesn't seem particularly happy with me.\"</p><p>The premier said Rustad recently said he would prohibit teaching climate science in classrooms.</p><p>\"He says that the connection between carbon dioxide emitted from human activities and climate change is a big lie,\" said Eby. \"And when 100 heat records across Canada were just broken and we're facing another massive forest fire season, that's who (Weaver) appears to be wanting to align himself with. It is extremely bizarre. I don't understand it.\" </p><p>Rustad says in a statement on his party's website that the \"changing climate is real, and man is impacting our climate,\" but it \"isn\u2019t a crisis\" and the party will not engage in \"over-taxation, hype, scare tactics\" on the issue.</p><p>Weaver, who was lead author for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that won a Nobel Prize, said his views on climate are not the same as Rustad's, but he considers the Conservative leader a listener.</p><p>He said Rustad is in the image of former NDP premier John Horgan \u2014 who Weaver supported in a minority NDP government seven years ago \u2014 and is not like Eby, who controls power in his office.</p><p>\"John Rustad's views on climate are clearly not the same as mine,\" Weaver said. \"But the gaps there are not as great as some people may think. I don't think his views are one of denial. I don't think that's a fair characterization.\"</p><p>Another eye-opening shift on the B.C. political scene was the recent defection to the Conservatives of former BC United MLA Elenore Sturko, a champion of gay rights, who said last year that Rustad needed to \"make an unequivocal apology\" for calling homosexuality a \"lifestyle.\"</p><p>Sturko, who is gay, said after her defection in June that it was easy to ignore polls that have consistently put BC United distantly behind the NDP and the Conservatives, but it was impossible to dismiss what she was hearing from voters.</p><p>The B.C. Conservatives now have four people in the legislature \u2014 Rustad, Sturko, Bruce Banman and Lorne Doerkson, all former members of Falcon's party who crossed the floor.</p><p>David Black, a political communications professor at Greater Victoria's Royal Roads University, said the political manoeuvres are largely tied to the surge in popularity of Rustad's Conservatives and the steep decline of Falcon's BC United.</p><p>The B.C. Conservatives received less than two per cent of the popular vote in the 2020 provincial election, but it now appears they are in a position to become the official opposition or even form government after the fall vote, he said.</p><p>BC United and the Greens could be completely shut out, said Black.</p><p>\"These things will change in September with the writ, and I don't know where it's going to go, I really don't,\" he said. \"But I think we can expect some volatility because it's going to be a very energized political environment.\"</p><p>Black said he's not as astounded by Weaver's advances toward Rustad, judging from Weaver's past political moves that saw him exit the Greens, sit as an independent and endorse Horgan's NDP in 2020.</p><p>\"This is Weaver exploring the outward reaches of his sometimes-contrary self,\" Black said. \"It is a very odd marriage of personalities and positions. It's more of a pretext of just what Weaver, and fairly so, believes to be of a number of vulnerabilities and errors he thinks Eby has made.\"</p><p>Environment Minister George Heyman, a veteran NDP minister who has also announced he's not running in the fall election, said he can't understand how Weaver could consider aligning himself with Rustad, \"who barely gives credence to the notion that there's climate change.\"</p><p>\"I haven't had a chance to talk to Andrew about this but I simply can't believe he would turn his back on his life's work and the work we accomplished together in government,\" he said. \"It simply doesn't make sense to me.\"</p><p>Heyman dismissed Weaver's suggestions that Eby controls power from his office and said he can't speak for his colleagues but his decision not to run for re-election came after a lengthy career in politics and environmental and union leadership.</p><p>\"I'll be 75 years old when the election's held in 2024,\" he said. \"I would like to slow down a bit and spend more time with my family.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 12, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e9dae6db7a764cae90798500e8efd558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CG6-T331-JBVR-30NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><timeReceived>07:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 12, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It wasn't threatening any communities, but the owners of seasonal cabins in the area have been asked to leave for their own safety.</p><p>Motty said there are two other fires burning in the province's central zone and there is no rain in the forecast. \"We've had fire growth in all three of those fires over yesterday \u2014 a really hot, dry day with a bit of wind,\" he said.</p><p>In all, the province is using five water bombers \u2014 two from Quebec \u2014 and four helicopters to fight the fires.</p><p>The Bay d'Espoir Highway is the only road connecting the communities of Harbour Breton, Hermitage and Conne River to the Trans-Canada Highway, the main provincial highway across Newfoundland. The 200-kilometre rural road runs north to south through a sparsely populated area that includes many other tiny communities. </p><p>The region's health authority has plans in place to deal with any medical emergencies. \"If they need one of our helicopters for an emergency, we would certainly accommodate that,\" Motty said. \"Our No. 1 operational objective is to open that highway again.\"</p><p>On a Facebook page that tracks driving conditions on the highway, residents on both sides of the blocked route were offering help to those stranded by the fires.</p><p>\"If anyone on the TCH side is stuck and needs a shower or fresh meal, send me a (message),\" said one post. \"I\u2019m in (Grand Falls-Windsor) and happy to help if I can.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, residents in some of the smaller communities south of the fire said they were worried about food and supplies running out and the lack of access to medical care.</p><p>\"There are also people on the wrong side of the fire waiting for dialysis and chemo and surgeries and other medical issues,\" said one Facebook post.</p><p>\"We do not have a doctor nor an emergency room to go if one should be needed in the event of heart attack, stroke or accident or any emergency .... One helicopter cannot accommodate the need for medical emergencies throughout all the Coast of Bays (federal riding). There are also transport trucks stuck here.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Premier Andrew Furey issued a brief statement on Twitter, saying he appreciates the support from Quebec.</p><p>\"I have been speaking with my federal colleagues to let them know we may need further support, and am assured they will be there as needed,\" he said. \"Stay safe.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 5, 2022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f398c51da15d49f0929b944058e42d46</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:663F-DDK1-DY9S-T25C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><timeReceived>03:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 5, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
