Twenty-one personnel from the Yukon are bound for Alberta:six Wildland Fire initial attack crews from the Whitehorse and Dawson regions as well as an agency representative and an additional Wildland Fire officer. A May 9 notice from the territorial government states that the specifics of the deployment may change as the situation on the ground in Alberta does. </p><p>\u201cWe are thinking of everyone who has been forced from their homes, those on evacuation alert and the brave firefighters tackling the intense fire activity across Alberta. We will continue assessing our Yukon resources and send all the help we can over the coming days,\u201d said Community Services Minister Richard Mostyn. The firefighters left the territory early in the morning on May 9 and were expected to land in Alberta by late morning local time. They could be gone as long as 19 days. The government\u2019s notice states that adequate crews will remain at all Yukon fire bases in the meantime. \u201cThe situation will be continually reassessed to ensure that Alberta is provided maximum possible assistance while remaining prepared to manage any incidents that develop at home,\u201d the notice reads. Yukon firefighters were among those deployed to help fight the massive Fort McMurray fire in Alberta in 2016. This and the present deployment are examples of the Yukon\u2019s participation in the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre that sees crews responding to requests for help by other provinces and territories. Dispatchers from Alberta helped the Yukon during last summer\u2019s intense period of fires. The fire danger here in the Yukon is considered relatively low as snow is still on the ground in many of the territory\u2019s communities. In the event that changes, the notice states that the Yukon crews deployed to Alberta can be recalled on 24-hours notice.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and

A May 9 notice from the territorial government states that the specifics of the deployment may change as the situation on the ground in Alberta does.</p><p>\"We are thinking of everyone who has been forced from their homes, those on evacuation alert and the brave firefighters tackling the intense fire activity across Alberta. We will continue assessing our Yukon resources and send all the help we can over the coming days,\" said Community Services Minister Richard Mostyn.</p><p>The firefighters left the territory early in the morning on May 9 and were expected to land in Alberta by late morning local time. They could be gone as long as 19 days. The government's notice states that adequate crews will remain at all Yukon fire bases in the meantime.</p><p>\"The situation will be continually reassessed to ensure that Alberta is provided maximum possible assistance while remaining prepared to manage any incidents that develop at home,\" the notice reads.</p><p>Yukon firefighters were among those deployed to help fight the massive Fort McMurray fire in Alberta in 2016. This and the present deployment are examples of the Yukon's participation in the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre that sees crews responding to requests for help by other provinces and territories. Dispatchers from Alberta helped the Yukon during last summer's intense period of fires.</p><p>The fire danger here in the Yukon is considered relatively low as snow is still on the ground in many of the territory's communities. In the event that changes, the notice states that the Yukon crews deployed to Alberta can be recalled on 24-hours notice.</p><p>Contact Jim Elliot at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jim.elliot@yukon-news.com\">jim.elliot@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2023 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20230509IYN4468466</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686C-7PR1-JD2C-J2G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"332\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

More than 200 people with heightened medical issues filled three motor coaches in a quick move to a location with better air.  </p><p>\u201cYou could really smell smoke in the air and the sky started turning orange, like an apocalyptic movie,\u201d Deputy Chief Lance Cooper told the Nation. \u201cAs quick and crazy as it was, it went smoothly. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re finally home, grateful our community is still here.\u201d </p><p>Most residents had no more than five hours to pack up and leave that Tuesday evening, with many travelling all night to the C\u00e9gep de Chicoutimi about 400 km away on the only road still open. Community workers made the rounds to ensure everyone made it out safely while the local clinic transported necessary medications and supplies to provide evacuees with essential services.   </p><p>The C\u00e9gep and the City of Saguenay were praised for their generous hospitality, making the evacuation as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. In addition to meals and sleeping cots, local organizations and individuals offered support like babysitting. Amidst an international media circus, Cooper had an audience with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. </p><p>\u201cI told him straight out when you and my people go to sleep tonight, our land is still on fire,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cWe rely on our land for our life, culture and traditions. I understand they\u2019re focusing on human life, but they\u2019ve got to take account of the wildlife.\u201d </p><p>Waswanipi was also badly affected by the wildfire smoke and moved to relocate its most vulnerable members to Quebec City in a \u201cpre-evacuation\u201d phase on June 7. While Mistissini\u2019s power and land lines were briefly interrupted by the blazes, close coordination with leadership from different entities determined an evacuation wasn\u2019t necessary.  </p><p>\u201cThe Canadian Armed Forces has a coordination centre in Mistissini to protect Chibougamau, Chapais and Ouje-Bougoumou,\u201d said Jason Coonishish, the Cree Health Board\u2019s coordinator of emergency services. \u201cThat fire 334 already reached km 80 of the Route du Nord so there are many camps that burned down.\u201d </p><p>With Chibougamau\u2019s hospital temporarily closed and vulnerable residents being evacuated from several communities, the Cree Health Board struggled to secure sufficient beds in Montreal during the busy tourism season. Working with the city, it managed to keep many dialysis patients together at H\u00f4tel-Dieu, where recent renovations ensure service continuity. </p><p>Wildfires have raged in Eeyou Istchee since early June, when a fire close to Chisasibi was contained to swamplands. Sections of forest were later cleared to make fire breaks outside Wemindji and Mistissini. Emergency teams created during the Covid pandemic were reactivated, with each community\u2019s public safety officer (PSO) coordinating decisions with other organizations and Cree entities. </p><p>Fires crossed the Route du Nord, which remained closed until further notice. At press time the 113 was closed from Waswanipi to Senneterre and the 167 was closed north of Perch. Hundreds of kilometres of Trans-Taiga Road were impacted as firefighters worked to protect Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec infrastructure.  </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s advised at this time not to go into forestry roads and the forest,\u201d said Grand Chief Mandy Gull-Masty. \u201cSOPFEU is not able to carry out activities if people are in those spaces. We have issued a no open fire ban and are thinking of moving that to a zero fire ban because the forest is extremely dry.\u201d  </p><p>Northern Quebec continues to be exposed to high concentrations of fine smoke particles, which can quickly shift with the wind. On one smoky day, Nemaska enacted preventative measures and distributed N95 masks, which are now available in each community. Most communities have purple air sensors to help map the region\u2019s air quality data. </p><p>While cyclical forest fires were once important for maintaining healthy forest ecology, climate change has created more dangerous conditions. While the planet has warmed by an average of one degree, scientists estimate the temperature rise is closer to 2-to-4 degrees in northern latitudes, causing more incidents extreme weather. </p><p>This year\u2019s particularly dry season created the perfect recipe for fires caused by lightning or humans \u2013 most commonly cigarettes tossed from car windows or open fires not properly managed.  </p><p>Emphasizing that such blazes are a learning opportunity, the Eeyou Marine Region Wildlife Board (EMRWB) is calling on Cree to submit their observations and traditional knowledge about how fires can impact wildlife and habitat, both positively and negatively in the short and long term. </p><p>\u201cA large number of fires reoccurring within a short time is not natural, and the landscape and local wildlife populations may eventually not be able to adapt to this pace,\u201d said Angela Coxon, EMWRB director of wildlife management. \u201cMost wildlife can flee in time, but slow-moving animals cannot escape a fast-moving forest fire.\u201d </p><p>Although wildlife impacts are not yet known, Coxon suggested the flames could be especially disastrous for nesting songbirds and amphibians that require a very specific habitat. Fire-suppressing foam can be toxic to fish and amphibians, and block oxygen on water surfaces. Spawning fish will be impacted by the ash, debris and loss of shade-bearing riverside trees.  </p><p>On the plus side, fires can spur smaller vegetation growth that provide food for species like moose and black bears. Species like woodpeckers and nighthawks thrive with easier access to insects. However, this is small consolation for the numerous Cree who live largely in the bush. </p><p>\u201cAll these damages to what was once a flourishing forest will have an everlasting impact to many of us land users,\u201d lamented tallyman Allan Saganash. \u201cSome Waswanipi traplines have been severely burnt by these raging fires and will not be productive for several years. Hold back the tears and let\u2019s hope a fire of this size doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5c5ed2079cbb4104ac3aaaef45d25139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MF-PWG1-DY9S-T0HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><timeReceived>01:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 4, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Plants and animals have been too, experts say</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While experts advise people to stay inside and avoid wildfire smoke, or\u00a0put on a respirator-type mask if outdoors,\u00a0that's not possible for wildlife\u00a0who are out in the elements all the time, and it\u00a0could have consequences on their health too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Saskatchewan has seen a record-breaking year for forest fires and smoke. Around 1.9 million hectares of land have burned\u00a0as of Sept. 28, according to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency, breaking\u00a0the previous record of 1.7 million hectares set in 2015.</p><p>Records for the number of hours of smoke observed have also been surpassed\u00a0across the province, with\u00a0Regina seeing over 250 hours, Saskatoon over 300 and La Ronge nearly 850 as of Sept. 24.</p><p>Iga Stasiak, Saskatchewan's wildlife health specialist, says animals face the same impacts from smoke as humans\u00a0- including respiratory problems and fatigue\u00a0- with birds particularly at risk.</p><p>\"Birds have more efficient respiratory systems, so they can more easily absorb the toxins in the smoke and have a harder time clearing the particulates,\" she said.</p><p/><p>Stasiak said smoke can impact wildlife behaviour as well because\u00a0it obscures their sense of sight and smell.</p><p>\"Being able to find forage, to be able to find mates depending on the time of year, reproduction, those types of activities might be affected,\" she said.</p><p>Stasiak said people\u00a0reporting sightings\u00a0of animals on naturalist apps\u00a0and camera traps will help researchers see the impact smoke may have had on wildlife movement in the province.</p><p>She\u00a0said it's important to monitor livestock and pets for trouble breathing or eye discharge because of smoke.</p><p>Pets should be kept inside if it's smoky, and owners should call a veterinarian\u00a0if their animals\u00a0experience symptoms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Plants impacted by smoke too</emphasis></p><p>Forrest Scharf, the province's fruit crop specialist, said dense smoke\u00a0can have impacts on all types of plants.</p><p>Ozone, a gas formed by\u00a0the interaction between\u00a0solar rays and oxygen, can damage plant\u00a0leaves.\u00a0Scharf said smoke can also impact photosynthesis.</p><p>\"There's less sunlight coming down and actually being absorbed by the plants,\" he said. \"They aren't distributing other photosynthates to the plant;\u00a0it doesn't grow as well.\"</p><p/><p>Raju Soolanayakanahally, a researcher with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Saskatoon, said\u00a0smoke dries out the atmosphere, making\u00a0plants think they're\u00a0experiencing\u00a0drought.</p><p>As a result, they\u00a0close their\u00a0stomata\u00a0- tiny pores on the surface of their leaves\u00a0- which keep water stored, instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.</p><p>Soolanayakanahally said that\u00a0can impact plant growth.</p><p>\"Even a simple 30-minute exposure to smoke can reduce photosynthesis by almost 50 per cent,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Smoke could have benefits for\u00a0plants</emphasis></p><p>Scharf\u00a0said smoke also causes\u00a0photosynthetic netting,\u00a0which\u00a0scatters radiation from the sun, preventing heat stress on plants and allowing them to undergo photosynthesis more efficiently.</p><p>As a result, Scharf said the smoke also slowed\u00a0moisture\u00a0being evaporated from plants and surrounding soil.</p><p>\"So under drought conditions, it might have been beneficial that we had a bit of\u00a0smoke because\u00a0... we're not getting as much water loss.\"</p><p>Soolanayakanahally\u00a0said smoke can also spark\u00a0germination in areas affected by forest fire\u00a0- breathing new life into charred land.</p><p>He said studies have shown that smoke can also speed up the ripening of fruit, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340226661_BANANA_RIPENING_BY_SMOKING_CABINET\">such as bananas.</url></p><p>Soolanayakanahally said data from the Canadian Grain Commission at the end of the year will show if crops have been impacted by smoke, similar to how canola crops were affected\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/smoky-skies-delay-crops-grounds-honey-bees-1.6115389\">in Alberta in 2018.</url></p><p>Scharf said he's\u00a0also\u00a0keeping an\u00a0eye on fruit crops.</p><p>\"If they don't get the chance to send nutrients down to the roots, they might not overwinter as effectively,\" he said.</p><p>\"Next spring I'll be looking at things and looking at plant health this fall as well and just trying to gauge how much of an impact smoke may have had on their ability to overwinter.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

More than 100 young people from as far as Japan, Brazil, Mexico and Vietnam have enrolled this fall in the Red Deer Public Schools\u2019 International Education program, which is making a strong recovery after being nearly \u201cdecimated\u201d by COVID-19.</p><p>In 2020-21 there fewer than 24 foreign students in the district \u2014 mainly the ones caught here by the pandemic travel ban, recalled Brian Plastow, director of International Education for the district.</p><p>He\u2019s pleased to see a rapid recovery that actually started last year when 133 international students were enrolled in the district, mostly at Lindsay Thurber and Hunting Hills High Schools.</p><p>Red Deer Public Schools is still accepting more applicants \u2014 at least more girls, said Plastow, as the few remaining local home-stay accommodations are for female students.</p><p>He noted there\u2019s been a \u201cboom\u201d right across Canada in K-12 students who want to come to this country to learn English. While Ontario and B.C.</p><p>are still by far the preferred destinations, Alberta is picking up steam.</p><p>Red Deer Catholic Regional Schools also has many international students attending classes this fall.</p><p>Red Deer Public Schools\u2019 International Education program was formed in 1991 to \u201cadd some international flair to our schools and expose students to different world views,\u201d he said.</p><p>It\u2019s also been a revenue generator for the district, as \u201ctuition\u201d for International students is paid privately, by their families, and not Alberta Education. Plastow said international students are only accepted when there are enough classroom spaces and home spaces with local host families.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t know exactly how much revenue the International Education program brings into the district, Plastow estimates that about three more teachers can be hired because of these private tuitions.</p><p>He added the additional teachers also benefit regular students, since most of the foreign students have enough English knowledge to attend regular classes \u2014 and not the English and a Second Language (ESL) classes that are more geared to recent immigrants.</p><p>Coming to Canada to study is a real thrill for these kids, not only because of their new culture, language and friendships \u2014 Plastow said many international students are excited to live the \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d experience that\u2019s so widely recognized across the world through Hollywood films.</p><p>\u201cWe have the yellow school buses, the lockers, the cheerleading and football,\u201d said Plastow \u2014 even musicals.</p><p>Outside of forest-fire season, Alberta also has cleaner air and less crime than places like Brazil and Mexico, so many parents feel comfortable sending their kids here to learn English, and perhaps get a Canadian high school diploma so they can more easily enter post-secondary institutions in North America.</p><p>Plastow said field trips are planned every year to help the International students get to know the region, province, and each other. Among these are excursions to Banff, Drumheller, the West Edmonton Mall, bowling and other activities.</p><p>Red Deer Public schools officials get the word out about the program by attending international education fairs in various countries, and through relationships with agencies that recruit interested students.</p><p>So far, the mostly high school age students hail from about 17 different countries, including Europe, Asia and South America. Plastow believes African students might be more reluctant to enroll because of our cold winters. But the snow is \u201cmagical\u201d to many foreign students who would, otherwise, never get see it.</p><p>Plastow said their descriptions of our \u201cbeautiful\u201d hoar frost, for instance, has made him better appreciate something he\u2019s previously taken for granted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230909RDA0003857054</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694K-N3N1-JD2C-J1W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

No other information will be released until his family has been notified.</p><p>He was the second firefighter to die in under a week, after 19-year-old Devyn Gale was killed by a falling tree Thursday near Revelstoke, B.C.</p><p>Based on forecasted conditions, Natural Resources Canada expects the wildfire season will continue to be unusually intense throughout July and into August.</p><p>As of Saturday's national fire situation report, Quebec has seen the largest area of scorched earth this season, with 43,145 square kilometres burned \u2014 an area slightly larger than Vancouver Island and slightly smaller than Nova Scotia.</p><p>The good news, Blair said, is that conditions are expected to improve significantly in Eastern Canada if the seven-day weather forecast holds true.</p><p>\"The situation is far less dire than it had been even a week and a half ago,\" the minister said, though he acknowledged that very serious out-of-control fires continue to burn on the East Coast, and in Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>The government has yet to tally the costs associated with the wildfires, but Blair said they are expected to be considerable given how far the fires have spread, and how long and intensely they've been burning.</p><p>The other silver lining is that, so far, flames haven't compromised critical infrastructure in communities the way they did in Fort McMurray in 2016, when fire destroyed thousands of homes and buildings, he said.</p><p>\"We have not seen that type of damage as a result of these fires,\" he said.</p><p>READ MORE: Aggressive wildfire closes only road to Bella Coola</p><p>READ MORE: Canadian Rangers to help evacuate Quebec Cree communities threatened by wildfires</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230717PAB4492641</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68R3-7951-JD2C-J01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

The particles, known as PM2.5, are tiny enough to get deep into the lungs and cause short-term problems like coughing and itchy eyes, and in the long run, can affect the lungs and heart.</p><p>The EPA advises keeping outdoor activities light and short when air quality indexes reach above 150 on the agency's map. On Monday afternoon, cities and regions hitting that mark included Lincoln, Nebraska; Peoria, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio; Huntsville, Alabama; Knoxville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Greensboro, North Carolina; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Syracuse and Utica in New York.</p><p>Sensitive groups, including people with heart and lung disease, older adults, children and pregnant women, should consider staying inside, advisories warn.</p><p>Although air quality was poor in the Chicago region earlier Monday, it has already improved to moderate quality and was expected to continue doing so throughout the day, Biggs said.</p><p>Relief from the smoke crossing the Canadian-U.S. border won't be immediate, experts said. Large fires in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan are likely to keep churning out smoke throughout the summer and possibly into early fall, said Montana Department of Environmental Quality meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer.</p><p>\u201cThe worst is over with this round,\u201d Ofseyer said. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s still a ton of wildfire smoke north of the border. Anytime we get a North wind we\u2019re going to be dealing with Canadian wildfire smoke.\u201d</p><p>Climate change and rising temperatures cause the environment to be more prone to wildfires, and more susceptible for air masses to become stagnant and stationary, explained Dr. Ravi Kalhan, a pulmonologist and professor of medicine and preventative medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said of the repeated air quality alerts experienced by the Midwest this summer.</p><p>\u201cWe keep having these events. They\u2019re not just one bad day a year,\u201d Kalhan said.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre website reported 882 active fires, with 581 deemed \u201cout of control,\" as of Monday afternoon.</p><p>___</p><p>Anthony Izaguirre and Matthew Brown contributed to this report from Albany, New York, and Billings, Montana.

Like it or not there is evil that walks amongst us - Bernardo being one that did so prior to being locked up. Psychiatrists who have examined Bernardo have diagnosed him as having sexual sadism, voyeurism, narcissist personality disorder, paraphilia and psychopathy. Some would consider that these conditions are not treatable. A psychological risk assessment dated April 28, 2020 rated him as high risk for sexual recidivism.</p><p>When medical science can treat and effectively cure the likes of Bernardo then and only then can rehabilitation be considered.

The contest was played despite Environment Canada's Air Quality Health index for Calgary measuring between eight and 10 throughout the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The CFL and CFLPA have a policy that's been in place since 2019 that states on-field activities are to either be cancelled or ceased when the air-quality rating exceeds seven.</p><p>The CFLPA feels Monday's game shouldn't have been played due to a poor air-quality reading. The union says it twice informed the CFL in writing \u2014 before the opening kickoff and afterwards \u2014 that the contest shouldn't go ahead because of unsafe work conditions.</p><p>In its submission to the CFL after the opening kickoff, the CFLPA stated air-quality levels in Calgary were hazardous and posed a threat to the health and safety of players on the field. It asked the league to delay the game until such time as those levels dropped to seven or below.</p><p>The union also added if the game went ahead, it would bring the matter to the attention of Alberta's Occupational Health and Safety. The CFLPA says a complaint was filed and the OHS is now investigating the matter.</p><p>A game can start with an air-quality of seven so long as conditions aren't projected to worsen. But Environment Canada's AQI for northwest Calgary was still at nine four hours after kickoff.</p><p>Forest fire smoke drifted into Calgary overnight Saturday. Environment Canada's air quality index at kickoff Monday read nine out of 10, or \"high risk.\"</p><p>On Sunday, the CFL and union both monitored air-quality readings in Regina but the Saskatchewan Roughriders-Winnipeg Blue Bombers game went ahead as scheduled because conditions there improved.</p><p>\"The bigger problem we have right now is the league is trying to change the policy,\" said Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director. \"They've informed us they won't be shutting games down until (an air-quality reading of) nine and that's unacceptable.</p><p>\"These policies have been followed since 2019.\"</p><p>Poor air quality this year has resulted in a number of CFL teams moving their practices to indoor facilities. And in May, the Roughriders Green and White scrimmage was cancelled after two drives due to the poor air quality cause by smoke from wildfires.</p><p>\"Before the Labour Day Classic in Calgary, beginning at noon, air quality readings were taken inside McMahon Stadium every 30 minutes until the conclusion of the game,\" said a CFL spokesman. \"Each of those readings was shared with the league office, the CFLPA and the two competing teams.</p><p>\"This procedure is consistent with protocol for games where there has been a potential threat to air quality, as has been the case for a number of games this season. All readings taken during warm-ups and throughout the game were considered 'moderate.' As is the case with all matters, the CFL is happy to discuss all procedures and practices with our partners at the CFLPA.\"</p><p>The union and league are scheduled to meet Thursday in Vancouver. The meeting was scheduled before Monday's game but the issue of air quality has been moved to the top of the agenda.</p><p>\"None of our guys want to shut things down, our guys want to play football,\" said Ramsay. \"The CFL wants to put our members in harm's way, risking long-term consequences.</p><p>\"This is coming from the same group that vehemently opposes workers' compensation or any type of long-term rehabilitation for long-term injuries.\"</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230907PAB4511620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6945-RKY1-F0HF-8021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

I'm not talking about housing costs or the TTC,  retirement or policing. I'm talking about civilization. This should not be a dizzying question. It should be just the right size for someone who is interested in running the most diverse city in the world.</p><p><br/><br/> Can you imagine? Can you think in terms of the development of humanity as a whole and our participation in it? Are you capable of radically re-envisioning our way of life and intuiting the steps toward it?<br/><br/> Toronto is poised to be a world leader. The future is not bleak, there is nothing but nascent possibility everywhere I look, in the people, in the technology, in the fabric of this metropolis. <br/><br/> My question for the mayoral candidates is, \"What do you believe is the best of humanity, and how do you plan to make Toronto a vehicle that brings us closer to that?\"<br/><br/> Erik Berg, Toronto<br/><br/> Premiers Ford and Smith are our new reality<br/><br/> 'The new reality'? Canadian wildfires become the global face of unfolding ecological disaster, June 7<br/><br/><br/><br/>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith wants to pump oil into refineries faster than filling stations can pump gasoline into automobiles. All the while, Ontario's Premier Doug Ford is champing at the bit. He needs that gasoline so the people who will live on the Greenbelt  can travel back and forth on the highways he's building.<br/><br/> Is the growing ecological/health crisis \"the new reality?\" <br/><br/> Oh yeah!<br/><br/> Jack Drury, Toronto <br/><br/> Living in silos <br/><br/> in the sky<br/><br/>  is unnatural<br/><br/> 'The light is free.' How Frank Gehry hopes his condo project will give back to his home city, June 7<br/><br/><br/><br/> So our answer to solving a shortage of livable accommodation in large cities is living in silos (towers 73 and 84 storeys). <br/><br/> Do people really want to live in that type of housing? Architect Frank Gehry claims that living that high in the sky is free light, maybe not so much when an orange haze looms over Toronto, the result of forest fire smoke. <br/><br/> I think this type of accommodation is unnatural. I don't think humans were meant to live that high in the sky.<br/><br/> Dorothy Low, Richmond<br/><br/> Toronto can take notes from N.Y.C. street scene<br/><br/> We are Slowly Killing Caf\u00e9TO patio Program, June 8<br/><br/><br/><br/> Edward Keenan hit the nail on the head, as he so often does, in his column. I was recently in New York City and remarked that if only Toronto would get its act together and stop being so uptight, we too could have a vibrant and lively street scene.<br/><br/> What I experienced in New York: seating options in public squares and parks, restaurants and bars with outside, protected seating areas, food vendors with their carts or folding tables selling fresh fruit, juices, and snacks, street lanes strung with overhead lights and lined with tables and chairs - and the New Yorkers and visitors enjoying these public spaces, talking, eating, having a drink (sometimes alcoholic). <br/><br/> All of this in Manhattan on some of the busiest streets in the world. Surely if N.Y.C. can do it, Toronto can too.<br/><br/> Carla Murphy, Toronto<br/><br/> Can Bernardo actually be rehabilitated?<br/><br/> Canadian want revenge on Paul Bernardo, but that's not how prison works, June 7<br/><br/><br/><br/> Some citizens may be expressing their concern over the Paul Bernardo transfer and even seeking revenge. That may not apply to all or even the majority. There is another explanation regarding the outrage.<br/><br/> Mary Campbell claims that the corrections system has a mandate to rehabilitate offenders. That's fine but what ever happened to their other mandate to protect society from those who  break the law, sometimes repeatedly and violently? Isn't that  part of incarceration? <br/><br/> Further, does anyone actually believe  Bernardo can ever be rehabilitated? Like it or not there is evil that walks amongst us - Bernardo being one that did so prior to being locked up. Psychiatrists who have examined Bernardo have diagnosed him as having sexual sadism, voyeurism, narcissist personality disorder, paraphilia and psychopathy. Some would consider that these conditions are not treatable. A psychological risk assessment dated April 28, 2020 rated him as high-risk for sexual recidivism. <br/><br/> When medical science can treat and effectively cure the likes of Bernardo  only then can rehabilitation be considered. Until then he should remain in a maximum-security prison. When will Correctional Service of Canada acknowledge that their role to protect society from violent lawbreakers is as important as rehabilitation? <br/><br/> Chris Turner, Aurora<br/><br/> Not enough funds being spent on the real issues <br/><br/>Saudi power play hints at future of ownership, June 7<br/><br/><br/><br/> Bruce Arthur states any sport could be bought if the Saudis  pony up enough dollars. Money excusing morally reprehensible actions like the chopping up of a Washington Post journalist goes way beyond sport.<br/><br/> What about the money spent to support misleading official sounding information on climate change? What about the money spent to buoy political parties that do everything they can to thwart any meaningful policies to save us from out-of-control forest fires, flooding and rising temperatures? It all comes down to no one is spending equal amounts of money on the issues dear to a healthy democracy or a healthy planet.<br/><br/> As I decide to limit my outdoor activities because of the forest fire particulates  in my neighbourhood, I wonder - would I still be a rabid fan if the Saudis bought the Blue Jays.<br/><br/> Russell Pangborn, Keswick <br/><br/>  THE STAR WELCOMES LETTERS FROM READERS.

Some had to be evacuated, while many others were on alert.</p><p>A community particularly impacted was the Nazko First Nation less than an hour's drive from Quesnel.</p><p>\"The Nazko community was surrounded by three separate fires and it causes fear for everyone,\" said chief Leah Stump. \"The fires this year have come too close to one of our communities where our oldest elders reside and they were once again evacuated from their home.\"</p><p>Many of the biggest forest fires of note in the region were all on the doorstep of Nazko residents. The Teepee Lake, Pelican Lake, and Branch Road fires were the main threats to the many homes and other structures in the Nazko realm, but there were other nearby fires as well such as Gatcho Lake, Trumpeter Mountain, Davidson Creek, Corkscrew Creek, Lucas Lake, and many more.</p><p>\"The impact of the fires has a devastating effect on the community members every time they are driven from their homes due to wildfires,\" said chief Stump.</p><p>The problems go beyond just worry over homes and property. Almost everyone in B.C. this year, and many other provinces as well, have endured prolonged periods of smoke and ash in the air. Every breath taken, in those conditions, has an effect even on the healthiest of people.</p><p>\"The effects from the thick smoke from the fires causes many respiratory problems from the youth to the elders and creates a heavy, sad feeling for our community and community members,\" Stump said.</p><p>She added that while many people who face a forest fire are concerned about losing a home, these fires have been devastating to other values like sawmill timber supply, rangeland for cattle, and for the Nazko people it is both destroying their land-based larder and blocking the sun needed for natural plantlife to grow in a healthy way.</p><p>\"The seasonal traditional activities that are displaced by the fire leaves stress, forcing our community members that rely on the land to find another way to gather and collect,\" she explained. That has only been exacerbated by the drought hitting at the same time.</p><p>\"I'm very proud of the partnership that we have with the B.C. wildfire organizations,\" Stump said. \"Their quick response to fight fires has saved homes and lives. The communication that our community received has been top notch with the daily updates, community visits, telecommunications and email notifications.</p><p>\"I would like to also thank the members of the Nazko Valley for their communication and willingness to work together. And lastly the biggest thank you to the Nazko community members as they are the heroes that have stood beside us as the leaders of our community and given us strength and direction to do what we have to do to keep our community of Nazko safe.

The contest was played despite Environment Canada's Air Quality Health index for Calgary measuring between eight and 10 throughout the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The CFL and CFLPA have a policy that's been in place since 2019 that states on-field activities are to either be cancelled or ceased when the air-quality rating exceeds seven.</p><p>The CFLPA feels Monday's game shouldn't have been played due to a poor air-quality reading. The union says it twice informed the CFL in writing \u2014 before the opening kickoff and afterwards \u2014 that the contest shouldn't go ahead because of unsafe work conditions.</p><p>In its submission to the CFL after the opening kickoff, the CFLPA stated air-quality levels in Calgary were hazardous and posed a threat to the health and safety of players on the field. It asked the league to delay the game until such time as those levels dropped to seven or below.</p><p>The union also added if the game went ahead, it would bring the matter to the attention of Alberta's Occupational Health and Safety. The CFLPA says a complaint was filed and the OHS is now investigating the matter.</p><p>A game can start with an air-quality of seven so long as conditions aren't projected to worsen. But Environment Canada's AQI for northwest Calgary was still at nine four hours after kickoff.</p><p>Forest fire smoke drifted into Calgary overnight Saturday. Environment Canada's air quality index at kickoff Monday read nine out of 10, or \"high risk.\"</p><p>On Sunday, the CFL and union both monitored air-quality readings in Regina but the Saskatchewan Roughriders-Winnipeg Blue Bombers game went ahead as scheduled because conditions there improved.</p><p>\"The bigger problem we have right now is the league is trying to change the policy,\" said Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director. \"They've informed us they won't be shutting games down until (an air-quality reading of) nine and that's unacceptable.</p><p>\"These policies have been followed since 2019.\"</p><p>Poor air quality this year has resulted in a number of CFL teams moving their practices to indoor facilities. And in May, the Roughriders Green and White scrimmage was cancelled after two drives due to the poor air quality cause by smoke from wildfires.</p><p>\"Before the Labour Day Classic in Calgary, beginning at noon, air quality readings were taken inside McMahon Stadium every 30 minutes until the conclusion of the game,\" said a CFL spokesman. \"Each of those readings was shared with the league office, the CFLPA and the two competing teams.</p><p>\"This procedure is consistent with protocol for games where there has been a potential threat to air quality, as has been the case for a number of games this season. All readings taken during warm-ups and throughout the game were considered 'moderate.' As is the case with all matters, the CFL is happy to discuss all procedures and practices with our partners at the CFLPA.\"</p><p>The union and league are scheduled to meet Thursday in Vancouver. The meeting was scheduled before Monday's game but the issue of air quality has been moved to the top of the agenda.</p><p>\"None of our guys want to shut things down, our guys want to play football,\" said Ramsay. \"The CFL wants to put our members in harm's way, risking long-term consequences.</p><p>\"This is coming from the same group that vehemently opposes workers' compensation or any type of long-term rehabilitation for long-term injuries.\" </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept, 6, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-6923d7fa509940c3954f85859148c430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6943-VKD1-JBVR-301C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><timeReceived>06:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 6, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This Special Exhibition curated by Dr. Curtis Collins, the Audain Art Museum's (AAM) Director &amp; Chief Curator, features a collection of Buba ' paper toles and images from her ongoing series, Studies in Landscapes and Wardrobe, including Woman with Hollowed Tree (2016) and a specially commissioned work by the AAM entitled Winter Scene at Alexander Falls (2022).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Buba  is renowned for her diverse artistic practice that seamlessly interweaves natural and built environments. From the ordinary to the sublime, Buba  has explored a wide spectrum of subjects throughout her career. In 2006, her creative focus transitioned from interiors to landscapes, giving rise to her ongoing series Studies in Landscapes and Wardrobe. This series of photographic works features meticulously styled, solitary female figures enveloped by both idyllic and apocalyptic landscapes. Each female subject averts her gaze from the camera, engaging deeply with the space she inhabits. These works pay homage to the portrayal of women in art, cinema, and the tradition of the sublime within 19th-century landscape painting.</p><p>Karin Buba : Garden of Shadows will present a unique selection of Buba ' past and present works, which feature the intriguing interplay between summer and winter. The exhibition ingeniously juxtaposes photographs captured amidst frigid Arctic conditions showcasing landscapes in Iceland, frozen waterfalls, and snow-covered forests with the vibrant palettes of summer, featuring sprawling fields of dahlias, sunflowers, and rose gardens. The series maintains an unsettling quality, emphasized by the contrast of ethereal flowers against skies choked by thick forest fire smoke, as seen in Woman and Sunflowers (2022). An industrial presence, symbolized by geothermal pipelines in Woman and Pipeline (2021), adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, urging viewers to introspectively explore their relationship with an ever-evolving environment.</p><p>Among the exhibition's highlights are Buba ' recent and innovative three-dimensional still-life flower studies, influenced by the paintings of \u00c9douard Manet. These unique creations, crafted using the paper tole technique, bring a tangible depth to her exploration of the ephemeral beauty found in nature. Karin Buba : Garden of Shadows is generously supported by Janet &amp; Chris Bowell, Jane Irwin &amp; Ross Hill and Anne Ferreira.</p><p>Karin Buba : Garden of Shadows will be on display in the AAM's Upper Galleries from September 23, 2023 to January 29, 2024. A full-colour book featuring contributions by Doug Copeland and Shaun Inouye who explore Buba 'practice in the conceptual interrogation of media, setting up intersections between photography, film, advertising, and high art.</p><p> About the Audain Art Museum</p><p>Established in 2016, the Museum was founded via a major philanthropic gift of Michael Audain and Yoshiko Karasawa. The Permanent Collection is focused on the art of British Columbia, exemplifying the richness of cultural difference in Canada.

It all pointed to another day of a recommended moratorium on neighbourhood jogs and playground visits, especially for those with lung or heart disease, older adults and children who are at higher risk of adverse health effects.<br/><br/>Ontario's chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore suggested people get into the daily habit of checking air quality this summer.<br/><br/> \"That's our new normal now, is to be looking at all of those parameters,\" said Moore. \"Certainly, I start my day being responsible for the health of a population looking at all of those extreme weather events - air quality index, plume analysis, weather maps - that's my normal for the spring and summer.\"<br/><br/> The hazy skies and acrid air were obvious in downtown Toronto, where city officials suspended outdoor activities at child-care centres in line with measures taken by Toronto school boards. Several daycares vowed to keep little ones indoors for recess, multiple schools postponed outdoor excursions and some sports leagues alerted parents that evening training could be cancelled.<br/><br/> Even some Canada Post routes were halted Wednesday, when the agency said poor air quality forced it to suspend mail delivery in the southern Ontario communities of Windsor and Chatham.<br/><br/>University of Toronto professor Ira Jacobs said more could be done to educate the public about the risks posed by wildfire smoke, especially in conjunction with hot summer days that can create a \"double whammy.\"<br/><br/> \"That's the reason why we have schools that are very justifiably closing activities that will be occurring outside; cancelling recess. It's definitely warranted when we have these air quality warnings, particularly from forest fires,\" said Jacobs, a professor in exercise physiology.<br/><br/> Jacobs advised against exercising outdoors on days like these, and wearing an N95 respirator if long periods of time outside can't be avoided. He said particulate matter in wildfire smoke can carry tiny pollutants deep into the lungs.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre's website showed 480 active fires burning across the country Wednesday afternoon. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2023062968329776</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K5-YW01-F197-53B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The evening of the city of Vernon evacuation alert, I watched the sky turn dark in late afternoon and then glow red while ashes fell from the sky like snow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearly these events are connected to the climate crisis. For 30 years, climate scientists have been predicting that if we let CO2 levels climb above 350 ppm, these kind of events would happen more often and be more severe. In 2019 we passed 410 ppm of CO2 and we will shortly pass 420 ppm.</p><p>However, there is another dimension to the disasters in B.C. which is our forestry practices. Numerous studies demonstrate clearly that clear-cutting forests result in greater susceptibility to forest fires for at least 30 years afterward. With the lack of roots to hold moisture and the lack of a canopy for shade, the land is much drier and much more prone to forest fire.</p><p>The lack of roots also mean that water runs off faster creating more floods, landslides and subsequent droughts. A good example of this is Merritt, a town of 7,000 at the confluence of the Nicola and Coldwater Rivers. In the November \u2018atmospheric river\u2019 the swollen rivers overflowed and caused the whole town to be evacuated. The surrounding hillsides were heavily logged over the last 20 years, with pine beetle killed trees being as much an excuse as a sound reason to do so, as it was not just dead trees that were cut.</p><p>Not only do we log by clear cutting in B.C. , but we do so at a rate which is not sustainable. This is why the forest industry cries foul when there are plans to save more of the three per cent of remaining highly productive, low elevation old growth forests. The second growth forests are still far too young to yield the same kind of profits.</p><p>Even with continued logging of old growth, there will be none to cut beyond the one per cent in protected areas in another eight years. But the forest industry wants those eight years because they will be very profitable.</p><p>Clearcutting is followed by planting large areas of seedlings over the same large areas. This makes the forest more susceptible to both disease and fire. It is far easier for a fire to spread through a forest when the crowns are all at the same height.</p><p>Old growth forests embody several fire-retarding principles:they hold more water, have more shade, and have more diverse aged trees. They also are key to protecting biodiversity by having more kinds of habitats for more species of animals, birds, insects, fungi, and others. The herbicide glyphosate, now outlawed in Europe because of its connection to cancer, is routinely sprayed over young forests in B.C. to kill aspen, poplar, birch and alder, based on the outdated notion that this frees young conifers from competition.</p><p>Not only does this overlook the fact that these same trees are key foods for hare, beaver, deer and moose, but studies of tree interactions by Suzanne Simard, UBC professor and author of the book Finding the Mother Tree, and others clearly indicate that birch at least is helpful to growing conifers. Also, several studies have clearly shown that deciduous trees in the forest, being much less flammable than conifers, effectively slow down forest fires, or would, were they allowed to grow.</p><p>Because of the clear-cutting, our forests do not absorb as much carbon as they used to. At the same time, the increase in forest fires as well as the clear-cutting have meant that, since 2003, B.C. forests are net emitters of greenhouse gases. So much so, that in a bad forest fire year like 2017, forests emitted two and a half times the greenhouses gases as B.C. \u2019s total carbon budget (which does not include what happens in the forest)! Change is possible. For instance, there are several projects in B.C. as well as in the US and elsewhere where forests are logged selectively and no clear cuts are ever made. A more extreme example is New Zealand where remaining natural forests have not been logged at all since 2002! Forests are a complex web of relationships and trees are not simply wood factories. We are overdue for a radical change in how we manage forests in B.C.

That is fine but what ever happened to their other mandate to protect society from those that break the law, sometimes repeatedly and violently? Is that not part of incarceration - to protect society from these people? <br/><br/> Further, does anyone actually believe  Bernardo can ever be rehabilitated? Like it or not there is evil that walks amongst us - Bernardo being one that did so prior to being locked up.

I'm not talking about housing costs or the TTC, retirement or policing. I'm talking about civilization. This should not be a dizzying question. It should be just the right size for someone who is interested in running the most diverse city in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Can you imagine? Can you think in terms of the development of humanity as a whole and our participation in it? Are you capable of radically re-envisioning our way of life and intuiting the steps toward it?</p><p>Toronto is poised to be a world leader. The future is not bleak, there is nothing but nascent possibility everywhere I look, in the people, in the technology, in the fabric of this metropolis.</p><p>My question for the mayoral candidates is, \"What do you believe is the best of humanity, and how do you plan to make Toronto a vehicle that brings us closer to that?\"</p><p>Erik Berg, Toronto</p><p>Premiers Ford and Smith are our new reality</p><p>'The new reality'? Canadian wildfires become the global face of unfolding ecological disaster, June 7</p><p>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith wants to pump oil into refineries faster than filling stations can pump gasoline into automobiles. All the while, Ontario's Premier Doug Ford is champing at the bit. He needs that gasoline so the people who will live on the Greenbelt can travel back and forth on the highways he's building.</p><p>Is the growing ecological/health crisis \"the new reality?\"</p><p>Oh yeah!</p><p>Jack Drury, Toronto</p><p>Living in silos</p><p>in the sky</p><p>is unnatural</p><p>'The light is free.' How Frank Gehry hopes his condo project will give back to his home city, June 7</p><p>So our answer to solving a shortage of livable accommodation in large cities is living in silos (towers 73 and 84 storeys).</p><p>Do people really want to live in that type of housing? Architect Frank Gehry claims that living that high in the sky is free light, maybe not so much when an orange haze looms over Toronto, the result of forest fire smoke.</p><p>I think this type of accommodation is unnatural.

That may not apply to all or even the majority. There is another explanation regarding the outrage.</p><p>Mary Campbell claims that the corrections system has a mandate to rehabilitate offenders. That's fine but what ever happened to their other mandate to protect society from those who break the law, sometimes repeatedly and violently? Isn't that part of incarceration?</p><p>Further, does anyone actually believe Bernardo can ever be rehabilitated? Like it or not there is evil that walks amongst us - Bernardo being one that did so prior to being locked up. Psychiatrists who have examined Bernardo have diagnosed him as having sexual sadism, voyeurism, narcissist personality disorder, paraphilia and psychopathy. Some would consider that these conditions are not treatable. A psychological risk assessment dated April 28, 2020 rated him as high-risk for sexual recidivism.</p><p>When medical science can treat and effectively cure the likes of Bernardo only then can rehabilitation be considered.

By early evening, Toronto had dropped to 5th place, but the poor air quality is expected to continue tonight. <br/><br/> Canadian wildfire smoke even crossed the Atlantic, according to Europe's <url normalizedValue=\"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/europe-experiences-significant-transport-smoke-canada-wildfires\">Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service</url>, with most of the smoke reaching western Europe on Monday and predicted to continue further east until Thursday. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/index_e.html?layers=alert&amp;zoom=1&amp;center=59.29012466,-89.65103342\">Environment Canada issued a statement</url> saying Toronto's conditions were expected to improve for some areas on Thursday night. <br/><br/> As of Wednesday evening, the Toronto Jazz Fest said they are postponing outdoor programming until further notice due to poor air quality. <br/><br/> Toronto Public Health said Toronto Emergency Management is monitoring the impacts of poor air quality on city services and critical infrastructure. <br/><br/> When possible, city-run outdoor recreation programs will be moved indoors and program registrants can expect to be notified if there are cancellations or other changes. City sports fields, baseball diamonds and parks remain open. <br/><br/> The city has also suspended outdoor activities at city-operated Toronto Early Learning &amp; Child Care Centres and parents will be contacted directly about program changes. <br/><br/> Toronto District School Board said principals will decide whether to move outdoor recess and activities indoors based on local conditions. Students who wish to stay inside will be accommodated, they said.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wildfire smoke health risks</emphasis><br/><br/> Even at low concentrations, wildfire smoke can be harmful to health, Environment Canada warns.<br/><br/> While people respond differently to smoke, it adds that those with lung disease (like asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors face greater risks to their health.<br/><br/> The pollutant that carries health hazard concerns in wildfire smoke is known as PM2.5, as measured by Canada's Air Quality Health Index. <br/><br/> PM2.5 is the by-product of the smoke emitted by wildfires - fine particles of matter with a size of 2.5 microns or less. You could fit about 30 of them across the width of a hair.<br/><br/> At this size, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/there-are-dangerous-particles-in-the-smoke-were-breathing-it-doesnt-seem-like-any-part-of-the-body-is-safe.html\">PM2.5 can easily sift down through air passages to the depths of the lungs</url>. At that size, it can also pass into the blood, causing a system-wide inflammation that can exacerbate heart conditions and potentially cause cancers.<br/><br/> Those particles are capable of infiltrating almost every organ in the body, said Matt Adams, director of the Centre for Urban Environments at the University of Toronto.<br/><br/> By Wednesday afternoon, Toronto was registering levels of PM2.5 concentration more than 24 times the WHO recommended annual air quality guidelines.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Air pollution harms cognition and mental health</emphasis><br/><br/> Scientists warn that even brief <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/27/what-is-smoke-brain-how-air-pollution-can-harm-our-cognition-and-mental-health.html?source=newsletter&amp;utm_source=ts_nl&amp;utm_medium=emailutm_email=6F56498859EB1E39E5CAC2627F7BC1D7&amp;utm_campaign=frst_\">exposure to forest fire smoke and air pollution also has the potential to harm brain function</url>. <br/><br/> Sarah Henderson, the scientific director of Environmental Health Services at British Columbia's Centre for Disease Control, told the Star that studies show wildfire smoke exposure generally lowers brain performance in the short term. People who breathe in more air pollution consistently perform worse on cognitive tests, research shows.<br/><br/> There are fewer studies on the long-term impact, but the knowledge around air pollution can be applied to smoke, Dr. Samantha Green, a physician at Toronto's Unity Health, said.<br/><br/> \"We know that particulate matter and other components of air pollution can cause long-term neurological harm,\" Green said. \"For example, there's growing evidence associating long-term exposure to air pollution and an increased risk of dementia.<br/><br/> \"There is also similarly an increased risk of Parkinson's disease from long-term exposure to air pollution, and increased risk even of ALS,\" Green continued.<br/><br/> Different risks - such as \"increased prevalence of ADHD, lower IQ scores, increased need for academic support\" - are associated with young children, she said.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to protect yourself from forest fire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> Environment Canada advises people to check the Air Quality Health Index and monitor symptoms. People should stop or reduce their activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or if they begin to feel unwell, it adds.<br/><br/> If they're experiencing mild irritation and discomfort, drinking lots of water can help.<br/><br/> Keeping doors and windows shut if the temperature inside a home is comfortable is best, along with avoiding smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming.<br/><br/> Jeff Brook, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, told the Star there are many steps people can take to clean the air inside, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/this-diy-air-purifier-could-improve-your-homes-air-quality-and-protect-you-from-wildfire-smoke-heres-how-to-make-it.html\">building an air purifier</url> or using a \"state-of-the-art\" portable air cleaner or HVAC system.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/07/wildfire-smoke-best-ways-to-protect-yourself-and-your-family-as-air-quality-worsens.html\">Other steps people can take include wearing a mask outdoors</url> and keeping children, who are considered by experts as being more susceptible to smoke because their lungs are still developing, indoors on particularly poor air quality days.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Considerations for buying a respirator to combat worsening air quality</emphasis><br/><br/> Those who have to spend time outside should wear a well-fitted mask, such as a NIOSH-certified or N95 equivalent, Environment Canada says.<br/><br/> As air quality worsens due to climate change, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/26/as-air-quality-worsens-due-to-climate-change-is-now-the-time-to-buy-a-respirator.html\">some people have pointed to the use of elastomeric respirators as an alternative to regular pandemic-style masks</url>.<br/><br/> Respirators are \"gas mask\" sized and have \"disc-shaped attachments\" on either side of the face that can be changed to clean the air differently, Brook explained.<br/><br/> \"You can have modules that just remove, say, the particles, or modules that remove particles plus some of the gases that can be harmful (and) create odours,\" he said.<br/><br/> While needing such masks and respirators is \"clearly not the way we want the world to go,\" Brook said. \"They all provide a benefit in terms of protecting you from what you're breathing in.\"<br/><br/> Especially for people who need to be outside for long periods of time, wearing a really well-sealed mask for several hours can be onerous and may be tempting to remove for some time. In this case, Brook said it may be more beneficial to wear a mask with less of a tight fit as long as it's kept on for the entirety of time spent outside.<br/><br/> With files from Steve McKinley and Kevin Jiang<br/><br/> Manuela Vega is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star's Express Desk.

Almost one-quarter of those fires are in Quebec, and Environment Canada warned wind patterns were causing smoke from some of those blazes to settle over the western part of the province as well as eastern Ontario.</p><p><br/><br/> The smoke and fires prompted the cancellation of an Ironman triathlon race in Mont Tremblant, Que., shut down youth soccer and baseball programs in Ottawa and Montreal and compelled city officials in Ottawa and its neighbouring city of Gatineau, Que., to close outdoor pools and declare beaches off limits to swimming. About 3,700 athletes were to take part in the triathlon about 130 kilometres northwest of Montreal. But when they arrived Sunday, they found a coating of ash on their bicycles and a thick haze floating in the air.<br/><br/> The record-breaking fire season and expectation of continued hot, dry weather has some cities also cancelling or reconsidering fireworks planned for Canada Day next weekend. Gatineau disallowed fireworks planned for Saturday for the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday and is also barring them on July 1.

Only one was considered uncontained, and many of them were less than two hectares in size.</p><p>Anyone starting a controlled burn in fields or brush piles is asked to check the SPSA website for advice and information on any fire bans in their area.</p><p>The agency said cooler weather has led to a slower start to the fire season, but that the potential for fires remains, especially if there is a long stretch of warm, dry, windy weather.</p><p>\"The concern and the cause of these forest fires is the surface material that died last fall,\" said Steve Roberts, vice-president operations for SPSA.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is very volatile until you actually get fresh greenery growing up. And that's why these fires that start in the spring spread quickly and again cause threats where they could move enough to get into communities.\"</p><p>The agency said that the potential for grass fires in rural areas remains high in drier areas of Saskatchewan, including in the southwest and areas between Saskatoon and Regina.</p><p>The SPSA said its operations staff have been getting ready for this year's forest fire season, with more than 90 per cent of its seasonal staff returning this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadasaskatoonpublicsafetyagencybelievespotentialforwildfirescouldbeaboveaverage16828217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S1-5MB1-F03F-K3ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"328\"/><timeReceived>5:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

They're looking for food. They're looking for shelter and I think we'll see a lot more of them.\"</p><p>Wildfire is a naturally occurring, seasonal phenomenon. It has, historically, acted as a sort of cleansing ritual for forests and their ecosystems.</p><p>\"A lot of species were adapted to it. For many plant species, fire is a part of their life cycle,\" said Gr\u00e1inne Michelle McCabe, chief conservation officer with Calgary's Wilder Institute.</p><p>The problem now, scientists say, is that forest fires are occurring more regularly and growing more intense.</p><p>\"So, a fire that you would have seen every hundred years you're now seeing much, much more frequently,\" McCabe said.</p><p>Many of the studies looking into the effects of forest fires on wildlife conclude that what's needed more than anything is more study. Even the experts admit there are large gaps in the research waiting to be filled in.</p><p>The rough cause-and-effect contours of wildfires on wildlife, however, are known.</p><p>Whether caused by humans or nature, fire poses the biggest threat to those animals that are slowest and least able to react.</p><p>Larger, faster animals, like deer, wolves, rabbits, birds and Lauzon's black bear can usually find their way to immediate safety.</p><p>Smaller, sneakier animals, like mice and squirrels can burrow their way to safety under the ground.</p><p>The very young and very old are most at risk. Fish, meanwhile, can often ride out the heat and contamination in the deepest parts of lakes, although drastic changes to water temperature and composition can be deadly.</p><p>After that, though, the impacts of a forest fire get hazy.</p><p>Researchers gauging the effects of Australia's so-called megafires, which burned 12.6-million hectares of land (an area the size of England) between August 2019 and March 2020, said animals who are able to survive the flames nevertheless emerged to new and lethal risks. They compared the fire-ravaged habitat to a bare and burnt \"moonscape environment.\"</p><p>Starvation and sudden loss of protective shelter is one of the more pronounced causes of wildlife deaths following forest fires.</p><p>But environmental scientists in the U.S. have also hypothesized that animals, like humans, are at risk of smoke inhalation, lung damage and respiratory diseases from the hazardous air quality levels caused by wildfires.</p><p>If you're worried about the asthmatics and the elderly in Toronto, Ottawa or Manhattan, in other words, think of the choking tortoise, owl or moose in Sioux Lookout or Mistissini or Slave Lake.</p><p>And like their two-legged counterparts, animals that are forced to contend with tree-fueled, out-of-control blazes experience that most natural of feelings: stress.</p><p>\"Generalized 'stress' is often theorized to decrease immune resistance and although this effect is not always observed, it is possible that stressed animals in the wake of fire will be in worse condition and have weaker immunity,\" wrote the American authors of a 2021 study published in the journal Fire Ecology.</p><p>Lower immunity means an elevated risk of infection both from fire-related injuries and burns as well as from harmful parasites able to survive the flames, to grow and spread unchecked.</p><p>Historically, the reaction when wildlife are at risk from forest fires has been to let nature run its amoral course - to spare or kill based on the whims of the wind.</p><p>But McCabe said that wildlife conservation groups like the Wilder Institute are increasingly thinking about how to help some fire-threatened species as they stare down extinction.</p><p>It's the kind of intervention that captured the world's imagination when officials stepped in to save Australia's koala bears, 60,000 of which were killed, injured or otherwise impacted by the 2019-20 fires.</p><p>In 2018, there were estimated to be between 46,000 and 82,000 koalas in the country. In 2021, the population had declined 30 per cent to between 32,000 and 56,000, according to the Australian Koala Foundation.</p><p>The Wilder Institute has taken similar efforts with animals and vegetation.</p><p>Among them are the burrowing owl, an endangered bird found in the Prairies with an estimated population of about 300 pairs, McCabe said.</p><p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service noted that a burrowing owl had survived the destruction of a 2017 wildfire in California's San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Reserve by digging an underground refuge, true to the rare bird's name.</p><p>The majestic white whooping crane is another endangered bird whose Canadian nesting areas, in Alberta's Wood Buffalo National Park, are also prone to forest fires.</p><p>The whooping crane population was down to \"the tens of birds,\" said McCabe, but has grown to about 200 with the help of the federally protected status and the assistance of conservationists.</p><p>\"With each one of these species, in particular because their numbers are so low, any catastrophic event could devastate the whole species,\" she said.</p><p>Allan Woods is a Montreal-based staff reporter for the Star.

(\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce an update on its lithium exploration activities at the Hydra Lithium Project (\"Hydra\") located in the Eeyou Istchee-James Bay region of Quebec, Canada. Hydra is the subject of a 50%-50% joint venture between ALX and Forrestania Resources Limited of West Perth, Australia (\"Forrestania\") (ASX: FRS) formed to explore for lithium-cesium-tantalum (\"LCT\") bearing pegmatites, with ALX as operator.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The prospecting program that was suspended in early June 2023 due to unprecedented forest fire conditions has resumed in the northeastern area of Hydra. This area remains unaffected by the fires. The ALX geological crew has mobilized to the area of the Python East and Python West sub-projects (see Figure 1 below) where wilderness lodge accommodations were secured. The lodge is serviced by air and serves as a base for the helicopter contracted for the work program. Prospecting is guided by the use of satellite imagery and spectral analysis for lithium and associated pathfinder elements. The work program at Python East and Python West is planned to continue into early September 2023.</p><p>Figure 1.

Forward-looking statements in this news release include: ALX's 2023 exploration plans at the Hydra Lithium Project, and ALX's ability to continue to expend funds at that project. It is important to note that the Company's actual business outcomes and exploration results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include that ALX may not be able to fully finance exploration on our exploration projects, including drilling; our initial findings at our exploration projects may prove to be unworthy of further expenditures; commodity prices may not support further exploration expenditures; exploration programs may be delayed or changed due to any delays experienced in consultation and engagement activities with First Nations communities and local landowners in the region, and the results of such consultations; and economic, competitive, governmental, societal, public health, weather, environmental and technological factors may affect the Company's operations, markets, products and share price. Even if we explore and develop our projects, and even if lithium, uranium, nickel, copper, gold or other metals or minerals are discovered in quantity, ALX's projects may not be commercially viable. Additional risk factors are discussed in the Company's Management Discussion and Analysis for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023, which is available under the Company's SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.

Too better.</p><p>Tez and I started a number of seeds such as corn, tomato, lettuce, beets, radishes, with great success.</p><p>But the rain never ended, and the seedlings never stopped being seedlings, eventually getting to long and skinny.

It was an honour to be there for him and Zak's family,\" Bird said.</p><p>Bird said firefighters from California, Washington state and across the Okanagan took part in the march. He said Muise's firefighting gear was carried during the procession. </p><p>Muise is the fourth firefighter to die in recent weeks during what is on track to be Canada's worst forest fire season on record.</p><p>The Muise family said the outpouring of support and the memorial have meant a lot as they grieve their loss.</p><p>\"We are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of our son, brother and friend,\" Muise's sister Allison Tackaberry said. \"Zak loved life and loved what he was doing. He will be missed by all who knew him.\"</p><p>A celebration of life for Muise will be held Aug. 20 in Simcoe, Ont.</p><p>\"We are so grateful for the time we had with him,\" the family said in an obituary. \"We are so grateful for all first responders. Our hearts go out to all the families of fallen firefighters, first responders and those left who are still fighting.\"</p><p>Those wanting to make an expression of sympathy can consider a donation to the Canadian Critical Incident Stress Foundation, which provides organizational and family support, education and training for first responders, veterans and their families coping with loss, the family said.</p><p>\"Rest easy brother,\" Big Cat Wildfire, the B.C. company Muise worked for as a wildland firefighter, posted on social media.</p><p>RCMP said Muise, from Waterford, Ont., died on July 28 when his heavy-duty ATV rolled over a steep drop on a gravel road in a remote area about 150 kilometres north of Fort St. John.</p><p>Last month, 19-year-old Devyn Gale died fighting a wildfire near her home in Revelstoke, B.C.; Adam Yeadon, 25, died fighting a wildfire near his Fort Liard, N.W.T. home; and Alberta resident Ryan Gould, 41, died near Haig Lake, 140 kilometres northeast of Peace River, Alta., when his helicopter crashed while fighting another fire.</p><p>B.C. Premier David Eby said in a statement following Muise's death: \u201cI am devastated to learn that we have lost another wildfire fighter.

Almost one-quarter of those fires are in Quebec, and Environment Canada warned wind patterns were causing smoke from some of those blazes to settle over the western part of the province as well as eastern Ontario.</p><p>The smoke and fires prompted the cancellation of an Ironman triathlon race in Mont Tremblant, Que., shut down youth soccer and baseball programs in Ottawa and Montreal and compelled city officials in Ottawa and its neighbouring city of Gatineau, Que., to close outdoor pools and declare beaches off limits to swimming. About 3,700 athletes were to take part in the triathlon about 130 kilometres northwest of Montreal. But when they arrived Sunday, they found a coating of ash on their bicycles and a thick haze floating in the air.</p><p>The record-breaking fire season and expectation of continued hot, dry weather has some cities also cancelling or reconsidering fireworks planned for Canada Day next weekend. Gatineau disallowed fireworks planned for Saturday for the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday and is also barring them on July 1. North Bay, Ont., reported Friday it had considered cancelling fireworks for Canada Day, but for now will allow them to go ahead.</p><p>North Bay was among the cities blanketed by smoke again Sunday.</p><p>Environment Canada said the air quality index in eastern and northern Ontario, including Ottawa, North Bay and Sudbury, was above 10 on Sunday, which is considered to be very high risk. Gatineau, Montreal and its suburbs were given the same rating.</p><p>Vulnerable people are advised to avoid strenuous outdoor exercise entirely while everyone else should severely limit it.</p><p>\"People with lung disease such as asthma, heart disease patients, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke,\" the weather agency said in its air quality warnings.</p><p>The agency said the air quality in Quebec City would also pose a high risk throughout Sunday. Winnipeg and the northern Manitoba town of Flin Flon were expected to see high risk air quality Sunday afternoon and evening.</p><p>The poor air quality is expected to dissipate in Manitoba and northern Ontario by Monday but may remain above safe levels in eastern Ontario and western Quebec until at least Monday night.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-news20230626THS2023062668299997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JH-HR11-F197-5226-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

(\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce an update on its lithium exploration activities at the Hydra Lithium Project (\"Hydra\") located in the Eeyou Istchee-James Bay region of Quebec, Canada. Hydra is the subject of a 50%-50% joint venture between ALX and Forrestania Resources Limited of West Perth, Australia (\"Forrestania\") (ASX: FRS) formed to explore for lithium-cesium-tantalum (\"LCT\") bearing pegmatites, with ALX as operator.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The prospecting program that was suspended in early June 2023 due to unprecedented forest fire conditions has resumed in the northeastern area of Hydra. This area remains unaffected by the fires. The ALX geological crew has mobilized to the area of the Python East and Python West sub-projects (see Figure 1 below) where wilderness lodge accommodations were secured. The lodge is serviced by air and serves as a base for the helicopter contracted for the work program. Prospecting is guided by the use of satellite imagery and spectral analysis for lithium and associated pathfinder elements. The work program at Python East and Python West is planned to continue into early September 2023.</p><p>Figure 1.

A 2008 sample from the Python West pegmatite returned an anomalous value of 330 parts per million (\"ppm\") lithium, a showing which will be followed up in the current prospecting program.</p><p>Forrestania shares ALX's opinion that Hydra holds potential for LCT pegmatites, supported by the encouraging exploration and development results from nearby projects.

They're looking for food. They're looking for shelter and I think we'll see a lot more of them.\"<br/><br/> Wildfire is a naturally occurring, seasonal phenomenon. It has, historically, acted as a sort of cleansing ritual for forests and their ecosystems.<br/><br/> \"A lot of species were adapted to it. For many plant species, fire is a part of their life cycle,\" said Gr\u00e1inne Michelle McCabe, chief conservation officer with Calgary's <url normalizedValue=\"https://wilderinstitute.org/\">Wilder Institute</url>.<br/><br/> The problem now, scientists say, is that forest fires are occurring more regularly and growing more intense.<br/><br/> \"So, a fire that you would have seen every hundred years you're now seeing much, much more frequently,\" McCabe said.<br/><br/> Many of the studies looking into the effects of forest fires on wildlife conclude that what's needed more than anything is more study. Even the experts admit there are large gaps in the research waiting to be filled in.<br/><br/> The rough cause-and-effect contours of wildfires on wildlife, however, are known.<br/><br/> Whether caused by humans or nature, fire poses the biggest threat to those animals that are slowest and least able to react. <br/><br/> Larger, faster animals, like deer, wolves, rabbits, birds and Lauzon's black bear can usually find their way to immediate safety. <br/><br/> Smaller, sneakier animals, like mice and squirrels can burrow their way to safety under the ground. <br/><br/> The very young and very old are most at risk. Fish, meanwhile, can often ride out the heat and contamination in the deepest parts of lakes, although drastic changes to water temperature and composition can be deadly.<br/><br/> After that, though, the impacts of a forest fire get hazy.<br/><br/> Researchers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534720301713\">gauging the effects</url> of Australia's so-called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/12/30/canada-sends-two-more-groups-of-canadians-to-australia-to-help-fight-wildfires.html\">megafires</url>, which burned 12.6-million hectares of land (an area the size of England) between August 2019 and March 2020, said animals who are able to survive the flames nevertheless emerged to new and lethal risks. They compared the fire-ravaged habitat to a bare and burnt \"moonscape environment.\"<br/><br/> Starvation and sudden loss of protective shelter is one of the more pronounced causes of wildlife deaths following forest fires.<br/><br/> But environmental scientists in the U.S. have also <url normalizedValue=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac30f6/meta\">hypothesized</url> that animals, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/06/06/with-wildfire-smoke-in-the-forecast-for-toronto-is-it-time-to-bring-back-masks.html\">like humans</url>, are at risk of smoke inhalation, lung damage and respiratory diseases from the hazardous air quality levels caused by wildfires.<br/><br/> If you're worried about the asthmatics and the elderly in Toronto, Ottawa or Manhattan, in other words, think of the choking tortoise, owl or moose in Sioux Lookout or Mistissini or Slave Lake. <br/><br/> And like their two-legged counterparts, animals that are forced to contend with tree-fueled, out-of-control blazes experience that most natural of feelings: stress.<br/><br/> \"Generalized 'stress' is often theorized to decrease immune resistance and although this effect is not always observed, it is possible that stressed animals in the wake of fire will be in worse condition and have weaker immunity,\" wrote the American authors of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-021-00113-4\">2021 study</url> published in the journal Fire Ecology.<br/><br/> Lower immunity means an elevated risk of infection both from fire-related injuries and burns as well as from harmful parasites able to survive the flames, to grow and spread unchecked.<br/><br/> Historically, the reaction when wildlife are at risk from forest fires has been to let nature run its amoral course - to spare or kill based on the whims of the wind.<br/><br/> But McCabe said that wildlife conservation groups like the Wilder Institute are increasingly thinking about how to help some fire-threatened species as they stare down extinction.<br/><br/> It's the kind of intervention that captured the world's imagination when officials stepped in to save Australia's koala bears, 60,000 of which were killed, injured or otherwise impacted by the 2019-20 fires.<br/><br/> In 2018, there were estimated to be between 46,000 and 82,000 koalas in the country. In 2021, the population had declined 30 per cent to between 32,000 and 56,000, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.savethekoala.com/our-work/bobs-map-koala-populations-then-and-now/\">Australian Koala Foundation</url>.<br/><br/> The Wilder Institute has taken similar efforts with animals and vegetation.<br/><br/> Among them are the burrowing owl, an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry/cosewic-assessments-status-reports/burrowing-owl-2017.html\">endangered bird</url> found in the Prairies with an estimated population of about 300 pairs, McCabe said.<br/><br/> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<url normalizedValue=\"https://usfws.medium.com/burrowing-owl-surfaces-after-the-fire-aa870e34970\">noted</url> that a burrowing owl had survived the destruction of a 2017 wildfire in California's San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Reserve by digging an underground refuge, true to the rare bird's name.<br/><br/> The majestic white whooping crane is another <url normalizedValue=\"https://naturecanada.ca/discover-nature/endangered-species/whooping-cranes/#:~:text=The%20Whooping%20Crane%20is%20federally,and%20the%20Canada%20Wildlife%20Act.\">endangered bird</url> whose Canadian nesting areas, in Alberta's Wood Buffalo National Park, are also prone to forest fires.<br/><br/> The whooping crane population was down to \"the tens of birds,\" said McCabe, but has grown to about 200 with the help of the federally protected status and the assistance of conservationists.<br/><br/> \"With each one of these species, in particular because their numbers are so low, any catastrophic event could devastate the whole species,\" she said.<br/><br/> Allan Woods is a Montreal-based staff reporter for the Star.
