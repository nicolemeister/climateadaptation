The situation was compounded by strong winds, which allowed the fire to spread quickly through local fire barriers and wreak havoc on at least 500 rai of land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Pa Doi Tung forest fire control station raced to the scene, together with local officials, the Pha Muang task force, volunteers, and eight fire engines, to extinguish and confine the forest fire along the Thai-Myanmar border near Ban Pha Bue and Ban La Ba in Mae Fa Luang.</p><p>The fire was reportedly 70% suppressed at 11.40 p.m.</p><p>The Pha Muang task force also sent personnel to contain the fire near the road leading to Ban La Ba.</p><p>Chiang Rai Suffers Worst Wildfire in 20 Years</p><p>According to station chief Piyapong Sornchai, officials attempted to contain the fire to prevent it from spreading further and bolstered natural fire barriers such as the Lam Huay stream and a neighbouring coffee plantation with the assistance of two local villages.</p><p>Officials also sprayed water in specific areas to keep the fire from spreading to important landmarks. The worst wildfire in 20 years, according to locals.</p><p>Aerial inspections will be performed to assess the damage, with 600 rai estimated to be severely impacted.</p><p>More than 100 authorities would be deployed to search the region, with air support utilized to drop water on the same location to prevent flare-ups, according to Mr Piyapong.</p><p>Aside from Doi Tung, fires were also raging on Doi Jorrakhe in Mae Chan district and Pa Doi Phra Bat in Muang district, though local reports indicate that the blazes in these areas have since been 70-80% suppressed. The woodland in Doi Luang National Park near Ban Tham Pa Sang in Phan district was also burnt by the fire.</p><p>Chatchawan Panya, deputy governor of Chiang Mai, said the province had recently taken steps to tackle its record haze problems. Despite tight restrictions, he noted, unlawful burning and hotpots can still be seen in numerous areas across the province.</p><p>For the previous three weeks, Chiang Mai has had the world's worst air pollution, with PM2.5 levels average 332 microgrammes per cubic metre.</p><p>Chiang Rai Suffers Worst Wildfire in 20 Years</p><p>According to an air pollution report, 233 hotspots have been identified in national parks, restricted forests, Sor Por Kor agricultural area, and neighbouring towns.</p><p>PM2.5 levels have reached the 'unhealthy' red zone throughout the North and upper Northeast, with the highest level exceeding the safe threshold of 50 microgrammes per cubic metre (g/m3) by more than eight times, as people in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai have been urged to stay indoors and work from home.</p><p>As of 11 a.m. on Friday, the Pollution Control Department (PCD) stated that PM2.5 levels in the North ranged from 94 to 416 g/m3. The lowest was in Phitsanulok's Muang district's tambon Nai Muang. The highest was in Nan's Chalerm Prakiat district's tambon Huai Kone.</p><p>PM2.5 levels were 384 g/m3 in Mae Hong Son's Pai district's tambon Wiang Tai, 340 g/m3 in Chiang Rai's Mae Sai district's tambon Wiang, and 321 g/m3 in Chiang Rai's Chiang Khong district's tambon Wiang.</p><p>Chiang Mai governor Nirat Pongsitthithaworn issued an order late Thursday night requiring all governmental organizations in the province to have their officials work from home, with the exception of those providing direct public services.</p><p>The governor also asked residents of the northern province to stay inside and work from home in order to protect themselves and reduce the health impact of PM2.5 particles.</p><p>Chiang Rai Suffers Worst Wildfire in 20 Years</p><p>Chiang Mai's Muang district reported a PM2.5 measurement of 233 g/m3 in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Pinsak Suraswadi, director-general of the PCD, blamed the accumulated air pollution on local forest fires, hotspots in adjacent nations, and stagnant air. He expects thick smog to persist in the North, particularly in border regions, until April 14.</p><p>On Friday morning, the air monitoring website IQAir named Chiang Mai the world's most polluted big city, surpassing regular hotspots like Delhi and Lahore.</p><p>According to IQAir, levels of the most harmful PM2.5 particles, which are so small that they can enter the bloodstream, were more than 66 times higher than the World Health Organization's yearly guideline.</p><p>Thailand has been suffering from an increase in air pollution since the beginning of the year, which has been caused in part by seasonal agricultural burning.</p><p>According to the Public Health Ministry, about two million individuals have required medical care this year for respiratory diseases caused by air pollution. In February, officials ordered Bangkok citizens to stay indoors and work from home because the city was blanketed in toxic haze.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES080420230000502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6803-K021-F00C-6560-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 8, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001232</classCode><className>PARTICULATE MATTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX000322</classCode><className>COFFEE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The evacuation alert currently stops at Sparwood Heights Dr. and does not include Whiskey Jack Dr.</p><p>According to Sparwood mayor David Wilks, there are approximately 400 homes on evacuation alert. Forty volunteers are going door-to-door in the affected area to deliver news of the alert.</p><p>Residents should have a bag packed and be ready to leave at a moment's notice with essential items like a government-based ID, medications, money, clothing, personal care items, financial documents, valuables and keepsakes. Each household should have a designated meeting point outside the evacuation area and everyone living at the residence should be registered through the provincial Evacuee Registration and Assistance Tool at ess.gov.bc.ca. Pets and livestock should be moved to a safe area.</p><p>According to B.C Wildfire Service, a fire was discovered on Friday, July 21 in the early evening at high-elevation on a ridge-top. The cause of the fire was environmental, likely from lightening.</p><p>Strong winds have pushed the fire downwards away from the ridge-top. On Monday, B.C Wildfire Service listed the span of the wildfire as 150 hectares, which was an increase from Sunday's 41 hectare estimate.</p><p>Ground crews and heavy equipment resources arrived Monday night. They are monitoring the fire and setting up equipment. Crews were not able to work on the fire directly over the weekend due to steep and rocky terrain, and a lack of safe exit options.</p><p>Sparwood British Columbia Canada Forrest Fire Update: \u00f0\u0178\"\u00a5 Evacuation Notice in effect.

According to a July 24 update from B.C Wildfire Service, there is concern that water-dropping planes would wash burning debris down the steep slope and that helicopters would spread burning embers. Aviation may be used again in future if the fire spreads to a more moderate slope.</p><p>A team of response officers are using a camera to monitor the fire and an analysis is being developed that will include a suppression plan that can be put to action as soon as the fire reaches an area that crews can access.</p><p>Residents can expect to see more B.C Wildfire Service personelle and heavy equipment enter the community in the next 24 hours.

(Azimut or the Company) is pleased to provide an update on its exploration programs in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The access and travel restrictions imposed by the Government of Quebec in response to the unprecedented forest fire situation persisting since early June remain in place across a significant part of the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The field programs on the Pikwa, Galine and Pontois lithium projects have resumed now that the restrictions have been lifted for air access in these areas. Azimut is ready to expand its activities on other key projects as the situation improves. Over the summer and fall seasons, Azimut intends to complete 10 (ten) programs through its agreements with leading companies or as self-funded programs (see Figure 1):</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pikwa Property (Lithium), SOQUEM JV, 509 claims, 260.9 km2</p><p>The prospecting phase initiated in May and operated by SOQUEM has resumed. This lithium-focused program may be followed by core drilling, contingent on the success of the prospecting phase. Pikwa is a 28-km-long project immediately along strike of the Corvette property (Patriot Battery Metals), where an initial inferred resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O was recently announced for the major CV5 discovery (see press release of May 17, 2023).</p><p>Galine Property (Lithium), SOQUEM JV, 649 claims, 335 km2</p><p>This 33-kilometre-long project is a key priority for the Company. The planned 1,600-metre initial drilling program will test an area adjacent to Winsome Resources lithium discovery on the Adina project (see press release of June 13, 2023). The Galine drilling phase should begin later this summer, immediately following the intensive prospecting phase already underway. Azimuts field team is currently assessing ten (10) excellent multi-kilometre target areas on the project.</p><p>Corvet Property (Lithium), Rio Tinto Option, 877 claims, 451.2 km2</p><p>A comprehensive prospecting phase is scheduled to assess high-potential targets outlined by strong lithium-cesium-rubidium-gallium-tin anomalies in lake sediments (see press release of July 10, 2023). Additional work has been planned and will be further detailed once the program begins.</p><p>Kaanaayaa Property (Lithium), Rio Tinto Option, 421 claims, 216.4 km2</p><p>A prospecting phase is scheduled to assess high-potential targets outlined by strong lithium-cesium-rubidium-gallium anomalies in lake sediments (see press release of July 10, 2023). Additional work has been planned and will be further detailed once the program begins.</p><p>James Bay Lithium Property (Lithium), 2,954 claims, 1,539.2 km2</p><p>Azimuts comprehensive analysis of regional data identified numerous excellent lithium targets, which the Company acquired to form the JBL Property, currently comprising 13 claim blocks (see press release of January 23, 2023). The Company has ranked the 52 x 28 km JBL1 block as one of the most prospective areas for lithium in the James Bay region, and it has been prioritized for a self-funded prospecting program. The block will be explored from the Elmer Camp once the access restrictions are lifted in this area.</p><p>Elmer Property (Gold), 515 claims, 271.3 km2</p><p>Azimut has reported all the results from its drilling programs (242 holes for 76,162.7 m) on the Patwon Gold Zone and exploration targets elsewhere on the property (see press release of June 29, 2023). The maiden resource estimate is well underway. One remaining step is to survey the drill hole collars on the Patwon Zone to refine the resource estimate. The Company postponed the surveying task when the Elmer Camp had to be evacuated in early June due to the forest fire situation. The survey will be conducted once the project can be accessed.</p><p>Kukamas Property (Copper Gold), KGHM Option, 537 claims, 272.5 km2</p><p>A 3,200-line-kilometre helicopter-borne high-resolution magnetic and VTEMTMPlus electromagnetic survey was completed over the entire project earlier this year (see press release of February 8, 2023). The survey outlined highly prospective targets that will be the subject of a partner-funded ground follow-up program.</p><p>Wapatik Property (Nickel Copper, Lithium), Mont Royal Option, 220 claims, 115 km2</p><p>Exploration work has led to the discovery of significant nickel-copper mineralization related to an ultramafic intrusion on the property (see press release of April 24, 2023). Follow-up drilling is planned for later this year. In addition, outcropping lithium targets have been also identified and will be subject to an initial field evaluation. The project is about 20 kilometres north of Allkems lithium deposit (mineral resource of 110.2 Mt at 1.30% Li2O, published in August 2023).</p><p>Dalmas Property (Lithium), SOQUEM JV, 120 claims, 61.3 km2</p><p>A prospecting phase will be initiated to further assess previous encouraging rock sampling results indicating the propertys lithium and tantalum potential.</p><p>Pontois Property (Lithium), SOQUEM JV, 226 claims, 115.1 km2</p><p>A high-resolution heliborne magnetic survey was conducted to outline potential lithium, gold and copper targets. Follow-up prospecting work is underway.</p><p>Azimuts management cautions that results or discoveries on surrounding properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization hosted on the Companys properties.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. Jean-Marc Lulin (P.Geo.) prepared this press release as Azimuts qualified person within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101.

The cause of the fire was environmental, likely from lightening.</p><p>Strong winds have pushed the fire downwards away from the ridge-top. B.C Wildfire Service lists the span of the wildfire as 150 hectares, an increase from Sunday's estimate which stated it was 41 hectares.</p><p>B.C Wildfire Service stated that ground crews and heavy equipment resources will begin fighting the fire this evening.

With rain forecast for the C\u00f4te-Nord, Legault said he is now most worried about the Abitibi, where no rain is expected for five days.<br/><br/> Kateri Champagne Jourdain, the minister responsible for the C\u00f4te-Nord region, said there were 164 forest fires burning in Quebec Monday, up from 155 the day before. At least 114 of those fires were out of control, according to the province's forest fire prevention service.<br/><br/> Champagne Jourdain said the fires in her region northeast of Quebec City were unprecedented. She spoke in Sept-\u00celes, a city threatened by two fires - including one no more than seven kilometres away - with a third burning not far away. <br/><br/> The risk hit home during a helicopter flight over the fires Sunday, Champagne Jourdain said. <br/><br/> \"We saw that in an instant, the situation could change. So even though it may seem like it's far at times, the fires are at our doors,\" she said. \"The force and the size of the fire was stunning, so we absolutely have to let the teams gain ground.\"<br/><br/> She said 138 Canadian Armed Forces members arrived in the area Sunday, with another 100 expected Monday, adding that the troops have received training so they can support the province's wilderness firefighters.<br/><br/> More than 156,000 hectares have burned in Quebec this year, compared with a 10-year average of 247 hectares as of the same date. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023060668100498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-MHT1-JDV5-F2TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

Each household should have a designated meeting point outside the evacuation area and everyone living at the residence should be registered through the provincial Evacuee Registration and Assistance Tool at ess.gov.bc.ca.

The cause of the fire was environmental, likely from lightening.</p><p>Strong winds have pushed the fire downwards away from the ridge-top. B.C Wildfire Service lists the span of the wildfire as 150 hectares, an increase from Sunday's estimate which stated it was 41 hectares.</p><p>B.C Wildfire Service stated that ground crews and heavy equipment resources will begin fighting the fire this evening.

insurance policies to determine their level of coverage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some will be leery of pursuing damage claims for fear of spiking their premiums, hoping that provincial government assistance might be another source of financial compensation for home damage or loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of Thursday (Aug. 24), 88 properties in West Kelowna and the Westbank First Nation suffered damage from the McDougall Creek wildfire and 94 in the Regional District of Central Okanagan West Electoral Area.</p><p>The damage toll in Lake Country is three properties, while in Kelowna it is three homes and two outbuildings.</p><p>But Aaron Sutherland, regional vice-president for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, cautions homeowners that contacting their insurance carrier or the broker who sold them the policy should be an immediate first step.</p><p>\u201cInsurance policies vary but generally standard that fire loss insurance includes coverage for lodging, additional food costs and other expenses if you are forced out of your home,\u201d said Sutherland.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you take advantage of those options that are provided under your policy.\u201d</p><p>He also encourages people returning to their homes to closely check for smoke and heat damage around the exterior of their houses, such as door and window frames, to go over their</p><p>insurance policy coverage for assistance with potential repairs.</p><p>Sutherland says he understands people sometimes have apprehensions about talking to their insurer, for fears starting a claim will lead ultimately to a higher premium.</p><p>\u201cIt is a bit of a confusing process at times but this is what insurance is here for,\u201d he said.</p><p>To help relieve some of the confusion, Sutherland said IBC will have a team set up an information booth on Monday at the West Kelowna reception centre to answer general questions about insurance coverage.</p><p>\u201cThis is an anxious time for many folks so we want to be there face to face to answer some of those questions people have and help reduce that stress where we can,\u201d Sutherland said.</p><p>He said while insurance generally provides replacement value for lost homes, it doesn\u2019t account for the emotional loss of family or per-</p><p>sonal memorabilia, items that can\u2019t be replaced and are often overlooked when an evacuation order is given with little advance notice.</p><p>\u201cThese events are always heartbreaking for those who lose their homes with or without insurance,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cInsurance coverage can help someone put their house back together but nothing can replace what you have personally lost.\u201d</p><p>Sutherland acknowledged extreme weather events are a global issue bringing financial pressure on the insurance industry.</p><p>In B.C. , he said flood insurance is not offered in some areas because of floodplain exposure, but at this point, fire insurance remains the core business of the industry.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like we are setting new records every other year for wildfires and hectares burned\u2026 that is a concern and does place pressure on insurance premiums,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt places a greater emphasis on communities doing all they can do to ensure adequate protections are in place.</p><p>\u201cWe are getting a better handle on flood

In summary: Some change in global conditions, like, for example, a massive release of carbon dioxide and methane (and oxygen in one case) into the atmosphere, one or more invasive species, or, on rare occasions a foreign body like a meteor or major geological disaster causes local circumstances in an ecosystem to change enough so whatever is living there can't sustain itself anymore.</p><p>Usually the creatures that have the hardest time are the ones which take the longest to breed the next generation, which in our current time, includes humans. The last mass extinction before the industrial revolution was the loss of the megafauna \u2014 mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, and short faced bears, which evidence suggests, was caused by the spread of humans across the planet, who slashed and burned heavy foliage along the way to build their homes.</p><p>As of writing we are entering another week of many areas being encased in a cloud of smog from forest fires, including Inuvik in the north. Many recommend a person wear an N95 mask to go outside, as forest fire smoke has serious health risks.</p><p>It seems we may have collectively made our choice, deciding that enriching a select few of us was more important than ensuring the long-term viability of civilization. Now, we're clearly in the \"find out\" phase of the consequences.</p><p>As it turns out, climate disruption isn't just no more glaciers. It's also runaway inflation as climate disasters and crop failures disrupt supply chains. Of course, any comment on inflation needs to point out costs of goods have been artificially kept low for decades by globalization, where we used gigantic greenhouse gas emitting transport vessels to move goods from economies with low valued currency to our privileged shores. Not only did this create widespread inequality across the Earth, it also accelerated climate change.</p><p>If you think things are bad now, just wait until there's droughts across the Midwest of the United States, also known as the breadbasket of North America. Inflation will seem like a minor problem when there is no food available. In rural areas, we're slightly insulated against food shortages thanks to the growing food and hunting and on the land culture which still exists among many \u2014 so long as the land cooperates. But living on the land is likely going to look extremely different in 2050 than it does today.</p><p>Another aspect of climate change people need to realize is that as reality sets in and areas become simply too hot for human habitation, those humans are going to move to places they can survive, meaning heading towards cooler areas. This will put massive pressure on our own supply chains and infrastructure, assuming the people who migrate here in desperation come peacefully.</p><p>We're already at the point where floods and heat are killing people. It just gets worse from here. We need to start taking climate change seriously.

They say the severity of northern wildfires\u00a0has taken a toll, and\u00a0is unlikely to be the last climate impact experienced by the industry.\u00a0</p><p>\"[Airports] were already in need of some enhancements to keep up with current technology, and obviously, when you're building things like gravel runways on permafrost, global warming and climate change is certainly not going to help,\" Aaron Speer, vice-president of Canadian North, told CBC News.</p><p>Joe Sparling, president of Air North, shared those concerns.\u00a0</p><p>\"Much of the northern airport infrastructure was built during World War II,\" Sparling\u00a0said. \"We only have a handful of paved runways and most of the non-paved runways were built to accommodate a DC-3 aircraft, which is an aircraft from the 1930s.\"</p><p>Sparling says that as northern carriers continue to upgrade and modernize their fleets, airports must be able to accommodate the newer\u00a0aircraft.\u00a0</p><p>He's looking to see longer, paved airstrips, improvements to weather infrastructure, and the improvement of approach capability so pilots are able to safely land during bad weather instead of turning back.\u00a0</p><p>\"We want to make sure northern projects don't get overlooked, because they're extremely essential to the communities that require them,\" Sparling said.\u00a0</p><p/><p>According to Sebastien Michel, director flight operations for Air Inuit,\u00a0poor surface quality on northern runways routinely damages\u00a0aircraft. He believes it may soon get to a point where planes can no longer safely land.\u00a0</p><p>For many northerners, access to airline services has become more critical than ever. More than 65 First Nation communities across Canada were\u00a0evacuated this summer due to nearby\u00a0wildfires. Many of those communities\u00a0have no road access.</p><p>In\u00a0the N.W.T. last month, hundreds of people were flown out of Yellowknife and Hay River by Air North over a matter of days when those communities were evacuated.</p><p>'Smoke reduces visibility'</p><p>Sparling, Michel and Speer were part of the team that planned to share\u00a0their wildfire experiences with federal leaders on Thursday.</p><p>\"The smoke reduces visibility significantly, and it could reduce it to a point where you couldn't fly in there,\" said Sparling. \"Yellowknife has a precision approach.\"</p><p>The airlines say that as climate change impacts become more severe, the industry will need to adapt to more frequent instances of challenging weather conditions, like heavy wildfire smoke and storms.</p><p>\"With respect to the community of Old Crow [Yukon], you know, the decision to evacuate or not was a bit of a critical decision,\" said Sparling. \"Had the decision been left too long we would have been unable to do an evacuation. So while it didn't affect our operations, it certainly could have.\"\u00a0</p><p>Northern airlines are also hoping to address labour shortages. Michel said he and his counterparts often feel like \"organ donors\" to southern airlines.</p><p>\"We see our pilots, flight attendants, skilled workers going to the south, and this has a huge impact on northern operators and our ability to offer good service to communities.\"</p><p>NATA representatives will be advocating to see more northern training programs so that airlines can focus on local recruitment.\u00a0</p><p>Sparling says he's already gotten a positive response from other levels of government, and he was optimistic about Thursday's\u00a0meeting with federal officials.</p><p>\"We're looking to work with them and hope that our concerns relating to infrastructure and the importance of skilled workers in the North are heard,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"So far, we're seeing a good indication that they're open to hearing those concerns and are willing to work with us towards meaningful change.\"\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanorthnorthernairlineclimatechangefederalmeeting16974293</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S1-7KX1-JCMC-W2H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><timeReceived>9:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Haney Heritage Village &amp; Museum, perhaps fittingly next to a former forest-fire lookout .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Central for speakers at the unveiling were the devastating wildfires, along with impassioned pleas to take care of the Earth.</p><p>Like the first landmark unveiled at Marine Peace Park in Salmon Arm and the second in Chase Memorial Park, the beautiful P\u00edsell sculpture, which means 'trout' in Secwepemctsin, was created from rose granite.</p><p>A metal sculpture complete with viewing portals is part of the artistry, so people can look through and see significant locations and their Secw\u00e9pemc names.</p><p>The landmark was sculpted by Skwlax artisan Shayne D. Hunt and David Jacob Harder as part of the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project.</p><p>The unveiling and dedication on Sept. 16 was also a fundraiser for wildfire evacuees, with donations to the Shuswap Community Foundation Emergency Response Fund encouraged.</p><p>Splatsin Elder Julianna Alexander, who gave the opening prayer in the Secw\u00e9pemc language, implored everyone to do their part to caretake the land.</p><p>She pointed to over-logging and how water is dependent on trees and the climate cycle. All living things exist in a cycle and the cycles are broken, she said.</p><p>\"Without water we're nothing. And if we continue to do what we're doing, it will look like the Moon.</p><p>\"So we're all held responsible how we caretake the land and how we prevent damage to water and all our trees and plants and medicines.</p><p>\"I need to say that because right now we're real stressed and traumatized with all the fire. We're not the only ones affected by it,\" she told those gathered.</p><p>Bart Thomas, Neskonlith, also said caretaking is up to everybody.</p><p>\"Anybody who comes here to take, we've got to give something back to make sure it stays that way.\"</p><p>Thomas gathered Elders for a song prior to the unveiling, while smudging was completed.</p><p>He encouraged people to visit the sacred place with their \"best energies and best thoughts.\"</p><p>Artisan Shayne D. Hunt explained that when he designs a sculpture, he waits for the rock to tell him what it wants. This one was about transformation.</p><p>He said quietly he was one of the people who lost their home in the wildfire. \"That fire came in and just took everything. So I say a lot of prayers for everybody that lost.</p><p>\"I think the fire itself is a way of cleansing, renewal, having faith again in our culture, in our traditions.\"</p><p>Libby Chisolm, project coordinator, MC'd in place of Adams Lake councillor Shelley Witske, project lead, who was recovering following a vehicle accident.</p><p>Chisholm expressed much appreciation for all the Elders who made the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project what it is. She said it began a few years ago with an Elders meeting of the four surrounding First Nations where they shared their histories.</p><p>The placement of the landmarks and the story boards accompanying them are all guided by Elders.</p><p>Chisholm noted that the landmark signage is interactive, able to play the voices of Elders and recordings of the late Dr. Mary Thomas.</p><p>Elder Lucy William has been translating for the landmark signage and Donna Antoine has helped with translations.</p><p>Trina Antoine, project lead for Splatsin, said in the past her people managed the forests and would conduct controlled burns. Now all the fuel is sitting on the bottom of the forest floors.</p><p>She, too, urged people to respect the water, the land, the animals.</p><p>If people don't take care of Mother Earth, the Earth will give up on people, she said.</p><p>\"And everything will be cleansed. And she will do it. She will cleanse this land. Make it whole again for her.\"</p><p>Read more: 'Spirit of reconciliation': Landmark at Salmon Arm wharf creates awareness of Secw\u00e9pemc presence</p><p>Read more: 'We'll be here forever:' Landmark sculpture embodies Secw\u00e9pemc presence in Chase area</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@saobserver.netLike\">newsroom@saobserver.netLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2023 Lake Country Calendar</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-news20230921PLA4517303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6975-BCH1-F0HF-806G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

That is how retired Kelowna Fire Chief Gerry Zimmermann still responds today when people ask him about the Okanagan Mountain Park fire of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cPeople have not forgotten. For those who weren\u2019t living here then, it is hard to explain,\u201d Zimmermann said of those days in August 2003 when the city was threatened by a wildfire initially sparked by lightning in Okanagan Mountain Park.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cKelowna as a community stood tall when that fire happened. When I think of that fire today, I think about how people reacted, how they helped each other, how people worked together. I remember that more than anything when I am asked about that time.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zimmermann is long since retired from the fire department. He went on to serve a</p><p>term on council, and is now on his second tour of duty as a member of the Agricultural Land Commission.</p><p>He also continues to serve on the Black Mountain Irrigation District board and still keeps busy with his farm and managing its small vineyard.</p><p>But the fire in 2003 is never that far from his thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou never forget, you never forget. Two hundred houses burning down in one go. You never forget that\u201d he said.</p><p>Zimmermann says he often is asked to speak about that experience to groups, and he tries to offer some perspective on the magnitude of impact when that many homes are lost to fire.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things I ask if raise your hand if you have seen two houses burn at one time. You get a few hands go up. Then I ask of you have seen three houses burn at once. Fewer hands go up and that is something not seen very often.</p><p>\u201cSo when you are talking about 200 houses\u2026the magnitude of loss is hard to imagine. In the end, three of our firefighters and one RCMP officer lost their homes in that fire, so for many of us it was quite personal.\u201d</p><p>The Okanagan Mountain Park fire was ignited originally by a lightning strike in a remote area of Okanagan Lake Park on Aug. 16.</p><p>While the flames were visible on the isolated mountainside, the idea that the fire could be whipped up by the prevailing winds and ultimately destroy 236 homes in Kelowna and force the evacuation of 27,000 Kelowna residents seemed very far removed.</p><p>But as the blaze reached the city limits five days later, the Okanagan Mountain Park fire had everyone\u2019s attention-a</p><p>forest fire with the setbacks of hot, unpredictable summer winds and difficult geographic terrain made it difficult to bring under control.</p><p>In 2003, it was Mother Nature that stopped a city plan to bulldoze homes south of Barnaby Road in a desperate last-ditch effort to create a large firebreak that officials at the time believed was needed to save the city.</p><p>Faced with a gut-wrenching decision, Zimmermann remembers how the decision to proceed with the plan was made quickly and not one person in the room opposed it, even with the knowledge of what it meant and how controversial it would be.</p><p>For Ron Mattiussi, it hit home even more on a personal note as his house was one of hundreds that would have been demolished to create a massive fire break.</p><p>\u201cI remember Gerry (Zimmermann) saying to me at the time, if we do this, the city</p><p>will be in court for 20 years,\u201d recalled Mattiussi, reflecting in a Capital News article 10 years ago about that critical moment in the city\u2019s history.</p><p>Despite that, Mattiussi, acting city manager at the time, was willing to take the risk to stop further destruction as there was a fear the flames could reach Kelowna General Hospital.</p><p>He signed the request asking the province for permission to bulldoze the homes, but the plan was never implemented.</p><p>That was because at that moment, the wind changed direction, the sky opened and the rain began to fall.</p><p>\u201cBy the grace of God, luck and Mother Nature, things began to change at that moment,\u201d Zimmermann said.</p><p>But the change in direction also blew the fire in the direction of Myra Canyon which caused devastating damage to some of the Kettle Valley</p><p>rail trestles, with many destroyed and since having been rebuilt in what continues to still be an international tourist attraction.</p><p>At its height, the fire was fought by hundreds of firefighters, both local and others sent from departments across the province to help, along with forest service fire attack crews, helicopter and water bombers, and even the Canadian Army.</p><p>It took teamwork that, while evident on the ground, was not always so evident among the officials from the different jurisdictions.</p><p>A now legendary exchange between Zimmermann and a top official with the B.C. Fire Commissioner\u2019s office in Victoria resulted in Zimmermann being told to get in line or he could be replaced.</p><p>Zimmermann\u2019s response:\u201cGo ahead and try.\u201d</p><p>His attempt to honestly reflect on what was happening with the firefighting efforts in the daily press conferences created national media headlines for days.</p><p>Looking back on that time in the media spotlight, Zimmermann viewed it as a positive occurrence because he was emphatic about getting the message out to the public and in particular local residents, about the status of their community, their neighbourhood, and ultimately their homes.</p><p>\u201cWe had seen in a previous fire in Barriere near Kamloops earlier that summer where an absence of communication was upsetting to people and caused a lot of confusion.

He went on to serve a term on council, and is now on his second tour of duty as a member of the Agricultural Land Commission.</p><p>He also continues to serve on the Black Mountain Irrigation District board and still keeps busy with his farm and managing its small vineyard.</p><p>But the fire in 2003 is never that far from his thinking.</p><p>\"You never forget, you never forget. Two hundred houses burning down in one go. You never forget that\" he said.</p><p>Zimmermann says he often is asked to speak about that experience to groups, and he tries to offer some perspective on the magnitude of impact when that many homes are lost to fire.</p><p>\"One of the things I ask if raise your hand if you have seen two houses burn at one time. You get a few hands go up. Then I ask of you have seen three houses burn at once. Fewer hands go up and that is something not seen very often.</p><p>\"So when you are talking about 200 houses\u2026the magnitude of loss is hard to imagine. In the end, three of our firefighters and one RCMP officer lost their homes in that fire, so for many of us it was quite personal.\"</p><p>The Okanagan Mountain Park fire was ignited originally by a lightning strike in a remote area of Okanagan Lake Park on Aug. 16.</p><p>While the flames were visible on the isolated mountainside, the idea that the fire could be whipped up by the prevailing winds and ultimately destroy 236 homes in Kelowna and force the evacuation of 27,000 Kelowna residents seemed very far removed.</p><p>But as the blaze reached the city limits five days later, the Okanagan Mountain Park fire had everyone's attention - a forest fire with the setbacks of hot, unpredictable summer winds and difficult geographic terrain made it difficult to bring under control.</p><p>In 2003, it was Mother Nature that stopped a city plan to bulldoze homes south of Barnaby Road in a desperate last-ditch effort to create a large firebreak that officials at the time believed was needed to save the city.</p><p>Faced with a gut-wrenching decision, Zimmermann remembers how the decision to proceed with the plan was made quickly and not one person in the room opposed it, even with the knowledge of what it meant and how controversial it would be.</p><p>For Ron Mattiussi, it hit home even more on a personal note as his house was one of hundreds that would have been demolished to create a massive fire break.</p><p>\"I remember Gerry (Zimmermann) saying to me at the time, if we do this, the city will be in court for 20 years,\" recalled Mattiussi, reflecting in a Capital News article 10 years ago about that critical moment in the city's history.</p><p>Despite that, Mattiussi, acting city manager at the time, was willing to take the risk to stop further destruction as there was a fear the flames could reach Kelowna General Hospital.</p><p>He signed the request asking the province for permission to bulldoze the homes, but the plan was never implemented.</p><p>That was because at that moment, the wind changed direction, the sky opened and the rain began to fall.</p><p>\"By the grace of God, luck and Mother Nature, things began to change at that moment,\" Zimmermann said.</p><p>But the change in direction also blew the fire in the direction of Myra Canyon which caused devastating damage to some of the Kettle Valley rail trestles, with many destroyed and since having been rebuilt in what continues to still be an international tourist attraction.</p><p>At its height, the fire was fought by hundreds of firefighters, both local and others sent from departments across the province to help, along with forest service fire attack crews, helicopter and water bombers, and even the Canadian Army.</p><p>It took teamwork that, while evident on the ground, was not always so evident among the officials from the different jurisdictions.</p><p>A now legendary exchange between Zimmermann and a top official with the B.C. Fire Commissioner's office in Victoria resulted in Zimmermann being told to get in line or he could be replaced.</p><p>Zimmermann's response: \"Go ahead and try.\"</p><p>His attempt to honestly reflect on what was happening with the firefighting efforts in the daily press conferences created national media headlines for days.</p><p>Looking back on that time in the media spotlight, Zimmermann viewed it as a positive occurrence because he was emphatic about getting the message out to the public and in particular local residents, about the status of their community, their neighbourhood, and ultimately their homes.</p><p>\"We had seen in a previous fire in Barriere near Kamloops earlier that summer where an absence of communication was upsetting to people and caused a lot of confusion. We did not want that to happen again,\" he said.</p><p>\"I was certainly not used to being on TV every day as I was a pretty private person before the fire happened\u2026\"</p><p>But he said when it came to working the forest fire crews on the ground, the relationship was very good, as was the dissemination of information to the public and relationship with the media, credited now as a key to helping the community deal with the fire.</p><p>In an event filled with many memorable moments for the fire department, Zimmermann recalled that one fateful night when the fire swept down into Okaview and Kettle Valley neighbourhoods, a firestorm that had never been seen before or since in Kelowna.</p><p>\"It was frightening\u2026we had a crew in Kettle Valley and we did not think at one point they could get out.

In summary:Some change in global conditions, like, for example, a massive release of carbon dioxide and methane (and oxygen in one case) into the atmosphere, one or more invasive species, or, on rare occasions a foreign body like a meteor or major geological disaster causes local circumstances in an ecosystem to change enough so whatever is living there can\u2019t sustain itself anymore.</p><p>Usually the creatures that have the hardest time are the ones which take the longest to breed the next generation, which in our current time, includes humans. The last mass extinction before the industrial revolution was the loss of the megafauna \u2014 mam-moths, woolly rhinoceros, and short faced bears, which evidence suggests, was caused by the spread of humans across the planet, who slashed and burned heavy foliage along the way to build their homes.</p><p>As of writing we are entering another week of many areas being encased in a cloud of smog from forest fires, including Inuvik in the north. Many recommend a person wear an N95 mask to go outside, as forest fire smoke has serious health risks.</p><p>It seems we may have collectively made our choice, deciding that enriching a select few of us was more important than ensuring the long-term viability of civilization. Now, we\u2019re clearly in the \u201cfind out\u201d phase of the consequences.</p><p>As it turns out, climate disruption isn\u2019t just no more glaciers. It\u2019s also runaway inflation as climate disasters and crop failures disrupt supply chains. Of course, any comment on inflation needs to point out costs of goods have been artificially kept low for decades by globalization, where we used gigantic greenhouse gas emitting transport vessels to move goods from economies with low valued currency to our privileged shores. Not only did this create widespread inequality across the Earth, it also accelerated climate change.</p><p>If you think things are bad now, just wait until there\u2019s droughts across the Midwest of the United States, also known as the breadbasket of North America. Inflation will seem like a minor problem when there is no food available. In rural areas, we\u2019re slightly insulated against food shortages thanks to the growing food and hunting and on the land culture which still exists among many \u2014 so long as the land cooperates. But living on the land is likely going to look extremely different in 2050 than it does today.</p><p>Another aspect of climate change people need to realize is that as reality sets in and areas become simply too hot for human habitation, those humans are going to move to places they can survive, meaning heading towards cooler areas. This will put massive pressure on our own supply chains and infrastructure, assuming the people who migrate here in desperation come peacefully.</p><p>We\u2019re already at the point where floods and heat are killing people. It just gets worse from here. We need to start taking climate change seriously. Now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGAHRO-news20230804PPDA0003775442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGAHRO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VX-PW41-F0HF-845J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Hunt and David Jacob Harder as part of the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project.</p><p>The unveiling and dedication on Sept. 16 was also a fundraiser for wildfire evacuees, with donations to the Shuswap Community Foundation Emergency Response Fund encouraged.</p><p>Splatsin Elder Julianna Alexander, who gave the opening prayer in the Secw\u00e9pemc language, implored everyone to do their part to caretake the land.</p><p>She pointed to over-logging and how water is dependent on trees and the climate cycle. All living things exist in a cycle and the cycles are broken, she said.</p><p>\"Without water we're nothing. And if we continue to do what we're doing, it will look like the Moon.</p><p>\"So we're all held responsible how we caretake the land and how we prevent damage to water and all our trees and plants and medicines.</p><p>\"I need to say that because right now we're real stressed and traumatized with all the fire. We're not the only ones affected by it,\" she told those gathered.</p><p>Bart Thomas, Neskonlith, also said caretaking is up to everybody.</p><p>\"Anybody who comes here to take, we've got to give something back to make sure it stays that way.\"</p><p>Thomas gathered Elders for a song prior to the unveiling, while smudging was completed.</p><p>He encouraged people to visit the sacred place with their \"best energies and best thoughts.\"</p><p>Artisan Shayne D. Hunt explained that when he designs a sculpture, he waits for the rock to tell him what it wants. This one was about transformation.</p><p>He said quietly he was one of the people who lost their home in the wildfire. \"That fire came in and just took everything. So I say a lot of prayers for everybody that lost.</p><p>\"I think the fire itself is a way of cleansing, renewal, having faith again in our culture, in our traditions.\"</p><p>Libby Chisolm, project coordinator, MC'd in place of Adams Lake councillor Shelley Witske, project lead, who was recovering following a vehicle accident.</p><p>Chisholm expressed much appreciation for all the Elders who made the Secw\u00e9pemc Landmarks Project what it is. She said it began a few years ago with an Elders meeting of the four surrounding First Nations where they shared their histories.</p><p>The placement of the landmarks and the story boards accompanying them are all guided by Elders.</p><p>Chisholm noted that the landmark signage is interactive, able to play the voices of Elders and recordings of the late Dr. Mary Thomas.</p><p>Elder Lucy William has been translating for the landmark signage and Donna Antoine has helped with translations.</p><p>Trina Antoine, project lead for Splatsin, said in the past her people managed the forests and would conduct controlled burns. Now all the fuel is sitting on the bottom of the forest floors.</p><p>She, too, urged people to respect the water, the land, the animals.</p><p>If people don't take care of Mother Earth, the Earth will give up on people, she said.</p><p>\"And everything will be cleansed. And she will do it. She will cleanse this land. Make it whole again for her.\"</p><p>Read more: 'Spirit of reconciliation': Landmark at Salmon Arm wharf creates awareness of Secw\u00e9pemc presence</p><p>Read more: 'We'll be here forever:' Landmark sculpture embodies Secw\u00e9pemc presence in Chase area</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@saobserver.netLike\">newsroom@saobserver.netLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2023 Salmon Arm Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALARM-news20230920PSB4516989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALARM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6972-1DD1-JD2C-J035-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438273</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Total emissions from all other sectors totaled 670 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2021. These figures prompted Kurz to describe Canadian emissions to be \"off the scale\" compared to previous years.</p><p>On 25 June, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre declared that the 2023 wildfire season has seen the largest burned area in Canada's recorded history. By the end of July, over 120,000 square-kilometres had been burned, nearly twice as much as the previous record of 71,060 in 1995.</p><p>The local wildfire season \u2014 already the worst on record based on hectares burned \u2014 continues unabated in British Columbia and elsewhere across Canada with August said to be the peak of the wildfire season.</p><p>@<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:wolfgangdepnerwolfgang.depner@blackpress.caLike\">wolfgangdepnerwolfgang.depner@blackpress.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230803PAB4499258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VT-DKJ1-JD2C-J1T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

The fire suddenly flared on Monday. <br/><br/> While Rose said he initially felt safe from his vantage point on the eastern side of the lake, he and his partner decided to get out Tuesday, just as an evacuation order covering the more than 200 properties around the lake was issued. <br/><br/> The order was quickly upgraded to critical, urging the seasonal and permanent residents to leave for Lillooet or Whistler.<br/><br/> Evacuation alerts were also extended to areas north of Gun Lake, including Tyaughton Lake and the Tyax Resort, as the nearly 18-square-kilometre fire almost quadrupled in size since Monday.<br/><br/> Rose said his father's cabin has been in his family since 1945 and it is where he spent his childhood summers.<br/><br/> \"There was always the fear of lightning (and) there was always a fear of a campfire setting off a forest fire and destroying the incredible natural beauty around that lake, so that's always been a fear in the back of our heads and now it's actually happened,\" he said. He said the fire has burned family traditions and heritage to the ground.<br/><br/> \"So, this is the first time in my 52 years that I've ever actually seen it. And it ended up close. So, it has this sort of sense of 'Lord of the Rings' of devastation,\" Rose said of watching the fire destroy the homes on the opposite side of the lake. <br/><br/> Rose's father, 81-year-old John Rose, said in a previous interview that he intended to stay as long as possible to keep the sprinklers running on the roof of their log house and on the heritage cabins on the neighbouring property built by his parents in the 1940s.<br/><br/> \"This isn't heroic,\" said John Rose, a retired BC Parks Service ranger. \"I just don't think anyone else could handle this set up.\"<br/><br/> Owen Rose said his father has since reassessed the situation and left the property Wednesday. He said their cabin was still standing and he hopes it stays that way.<br/><br/> \"It's three generations and memories that are there. That would be the greatest loss,\" he said.<br/><br/> The Gun Lake fire is among about 360 active wildfires across B.C., including 14 that the B.C. Wildfire Service says were sparked since Tuesday.<br/><br/> Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma told the news conference that about 530 people at more than 500 properties are under evacuation order across B.C., and more than 9,500 people at 4,100 properties are under evacuation alert. <br/><br/> The Canadian Press <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2023080368656443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VM-Y7P1-F197-51J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

As an, 'Oh, which which year is ahead?'\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"It has to be, 'Why are we seeing so many records?'</p><p>\"What it tells us is, something is going on, and that\u00a0something is not going to go away until we change society\u00a0and what we're doing to the atmosphere.\"</p><p>Meanwhile in Canada</p><p>Even if El Ni\u00f1o doesn't make 2024 a record-breaker,\u00a0its effects are still likely to be felt in Canada.</p><p>Typically, El Ni\u00f1o brings drier and warmer weather to the West Coast, which isn't ideal for the region after this year's record-breaking forest fire season,\u00a0Di Liberto\u00a0said.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you have hotter conditions and not\u00a0a lot of precipitation, that leads to drought or drier conditions, and then all you need is a spark,\" he said.\u00a0\"And then you can have these wildfires just go rampant.\"</p><p>But\u00a0there are no guarantees that will happen, he noted, adding that\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o's impacts are never as bad as the worst-case scenarios people tend to picture.</p><p>\"I always like to tell folks:\u00a0that image will never be true.\u00a0This\u00a0never, ever once happened in the history of the world.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewsscience2024elnino17007560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69KS-SRF1-F03F-K41T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Wildfire Service says it's dealing with nearly 400 fires, including notable blazes near Burns Lake in the Bulkley-Nechako area.</p><p>The service says the Tintagel wildfire, the Parrot Lookout wildfire and the Peacock Creek wildfire are all \"wildfires of note,\" and is reminding people not to interfere with firefighting after receiving reports of people riding all-terrain vehicles near active blazes.</p><p>B.C. is approaching its worst wildfire season on record as more than 390 fires burn in the province.</p><p>Wildfire Service figures show flames have consumed more than 12,900 square kilometres of land so far this year, just short of the 13,500 square kilometres burned in 2018.</p><p>Sophie Wilkinson, an assistant professor in environmental management at Simon Fraser University, says the season is on track to be the worst on record, aggravated by widespread and severe drought.</p><p>Her comments come after Canada's Minister of Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair announced last week that federal assistance, including military resources, were being mobilized to help B.C.</p><p>As troops arrive in the province, Public Safety Canada, the Canadian Armed Forces and B.C. emergency management and wildfire officials met to discuss deployment of the federal resources.</p><p>The ministry of emergency management and fire officials are expected to announce plans for the aid later today, as well as provide an overview of current conditions.</p><p>Wilkinson says the wildfire season is also unprecedented because there have been historic wildfire seasons in other provinces and territories, so interprovincial resources are stretched thin.</p><p>\"Although military aid has not been common in the past, it will become increasingly common because the severity of both British Columbia and Canada's wildfire seasons is increasing because of climate change,\" Wilkinson said.</p><p>Sarah Budd, aprovincial fire information officer for the B.C.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, March. 8, 18 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/>

Lafreni\u00e8re said a more detailed plan for the return home would be announced Saturday. </p><p>Forests Minister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina said Friday that the flammability risk for the Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon area had risen overnight. However, officials said both the town and a nearby pulp mill \u2014 which had posed a concern because of chemicals stored there \u2014 are well protected by fire breaks and by the arrival of additional firefighters from the United States.</p><p>The town of about 2,000 people has been under an evacuation order since June 2. </p><p>Lafreni\u00e8re said an additional 140 firefighters from Portugal would be arriving to help attack fire 344, which remained out of control Friday morning. He said the fire, which has burned 1,320 square kilometres, has come within 3.5 kilometres of Highway 113, an important route in and out of the area.</p><p>However, he said the winds appeared favourable, which should allow the firefighters to make progress toward containing the section of the fire nearest to the highway.</p><p>Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, located 620 kilometres northwest of Montreal, is the last community that remains under a full evacuation order after unprecedented wildfires forced more than 13,500 people across the province from their homes over the last two weeks.</p><p>Hundreds of firefighters from France, the United States, Spain and Portugal have arrived in the province in the last few days after the high number of fires in Quebec \u2014 and across Canada \u2014 forced governments to ask for outside help.</p><p>The province's forest fire prevention agency \u2014 SOPFEU \u2014 said there were still 124 fires burning in Quebec as of Friday morning. The province has recorded 455 forest fires this year, compared to a 10-year average of 229 at the same date. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 16, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-924d3719b8774249b08d31f8465043c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GM-7271-JBVR-32TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><timeReceived>01:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 16, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Just like the nightmare of 2003 Okanagan Mountain Fire, all local fire fighter units, RCMP, Central Okanagan Emergency Operations (ECO), and emergency rescue crews have answered the call \u2013 in turn been bolstered by a plethora of local volunteers.</p><p>Most impressive of all is the response of fire crews from out of town.</p><p>\u2018Miraculous\u2019 is a term used way too often, however, in the current scenario it is justified.</p><p>Without the huge number of forest fire foes frantically fighting flames for folks they have never met this fire would have burned out of control and done much greater damage that it has.</p><p>An impressive 31 municipalities have sent assistance to the West Kelowna, Central Okanagan electoral area, Lake Country and Kelowna fires allowing for attack and suppression squads of 500 firefighters during the day and a crew of 100 at night to battle the various blazes.</p><p>That overwhelming support has helped turn the fire back in many areas, saving hundreds of homes and thousands of acres of land.</p><p>Earlier this week, it was nearly impossible to know when nighttime arrived as the skies were a dark black or thick gray all day from the various fires all around us.</p><p>Hardest hit is the north westside area along Westside Road, where some 100 structures have been damaged.</p><p>In West Kelowna, the structure loss is estimated at 90.</p><p>I suppose, considering where we live and the heat wave we have just gone through, we should not be shocked with this environmental assault by Mother Nature.</p><p>We have been blessed by not having more lightning strikes and storms to work against us.</p><p>Some experts have suggested the weather should settle down this week and that the large fire crews now on hand will have the multiple spot fires under control.</p><p>That may be more wishful thinking than science speaking.</p><p>Regardless of weather reports, those operating the Central Okanagan Emergency Operations facilities are only allowing evacuees to return to their homes or properties when deemed absolutely safe.</p><p>Readers are begged to stay patient a bit longer and not add to the stress levels of those working the line.</p><p>If you know of anyone who may need a friendly couch or room, then please offer it to them.</p><p>My hat goes off to the many hotels, motels and businesses that are finding rooms for evacuees or out-of-town fire fighters.</p><p>There are so many volunteers, companies and individuals who are doing what they can to make these difficult times easier.</p><p>It makes me proud as a Kelowna resident to see people lending a caring hand and helping when needed like this.</p><p>Be very careful with your health. The air quality is terrible and dangerous, especially if you have asthma, emphysema, or a compromised respiratory system.</p><p>Be smart by being safe if the smoke in your area is heavy.</p><p>Stay inside.

Assay results are reported herein for three additional holes drilled to define and expand the Eagle Zone. The Property is road accessible and located 4 kilometres (\" km\") east of the village of Gold Bridge, and 10 km north of the historic Bralorne-Pioneer Gold Mining Camp which has produced over 4 million ounces of gold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This 2023 Eagle drilling is testing for down-dip and strike extensions of mineralization in the footwall of the Royal Shear fault that is blind to surface. All three drill holes reported herein have intersected significant gold mineralization. Highlights include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DDH23-072 returned four significant intercepts including: 7.87 grams per tonne (\"gpt\") gold over 7.6 metres (\" m\"), 2.12 gpt gold over 10.5 m, 3.61 gpt gold over 2.5 m, and 1.62 gpt gold over 3.6 m.</p><p>DDH23-073 returned two intercepts including: 3.17 gpt gold over 4.0 m, and 1.92 gpt gold over 8.2 m.</p><p>DDH23-071 is the first drill hole completed in the Crown area and intersected the northwest extension of the Eagle Zone with 3.81 gpt gold over 3.4 m.</p><p>\"We are pleased to see the Eagle Zone expands to the northwest and continue to grow with significant intersections at depth. We have deliberately designed this program with large step-outs to significantly expand the mineralized system potential and it continues to deliver.\" stated Robert T. Boyd President and CEO of Endurance Gold Corporation\"The success statistics also continue to demonstrate the strength and growth potential of the Royal Shear Structure with 70% of the drill holes returned significant gold intercepts. We look forward to further drilling success.\"</p><p>Drilling has now been conducted at the Diplomat, Imperial and Eagle Zones with fourteen (14) holes completed so far in 2023 for over 4,000 m of the planned 15,000 m program. Assays are pending for two drill holes.</p><p>DDH23-072 was drilled at -45 degrees to test the southern-central area of Eagle and intersected four mineralized intervals starting at a downhole depth of 109.25 m. This drill hole was designed to test the width of the Eagle Zone at intermediate depth with a drill setup in the hanging wall in an area previously drill tested from the footwall by DDH22-027.</p><p>DDH23-073 was drilled at -65 degrees with the objective of delineating Eagle area mineralization between holes DDH23-072 and DDH23-070. DDH23-070 returned 7.91 gpt gold over 3.7 m and 1.79 gpt gold over 6.9 m as <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/LG8bDTKo2Y\">reported on August 3, 2023</url>  representing the deepest intersection to date on the Eagle Zone.</p><p>DDH23-071, located 420 m northwest of DDH23-072, was drilled at -45 degrees and designed to test in the unexplored Crown area between the Eagle Zone and the Imperial Zone. This drill hole successfully intersected the Eagle Zone commencing at 211.15 m downhole depth, representing a significant 125 m northwest extension of the Eagle Zone along strike and at depth. As a result, the Eagle Zone has now been traced with drill holes over 550 m.</p><p>Results from 2023 diamond drilling are summarized in Table 1 and highlight intersections are shown on the Royal Shear plan map <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/oL1B7UW1j4\">in Figure 1</url> , the longitudinal section <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/O3MbzSK5z7\">in Figure 2</url> , and the Eagle cross section with two of the reported three holes <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PLBb4UNErQ\">in Figure 3</url> .</p><p>This drilling demonstrates that the Eagle Zone mineralization is the most consistently mineralized structure currently identified at 550 m of trend, about 350 m downdip, or 250 m vertically below surface, and remains open to expansion at depth and along strike. Within the Eagle area, results from drilling to date indicate that two dominant mineralized structures referred to as Eagle South and Eagle Zone which are both southwest dipping and appear to be sub-parallel and separated by 60 to 80 m. In addition, a shallower dipping trend, the 020 Zone, links these two steeper dipping features. Ongoing drilling is testing the importance and continuity of these structures.</p><p>Since 2021, the Company has completed 73 diamond drill holes on the Reliance Property with 50 of these drill holes returning significant intersections of greater than 3 m width with grades exceeding 3.4 gpt gold, and twenty-three (23) of these drill holes with very high-quality intersections as summarized in Table 2. A complete tabulation of prior drill hole results for 2021 through 2022 is available on <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/wWwp8FX840\">the Company website</url> .</p><p>Forest Fire Update</p><p>A forest fire near the Company's crew house near Gun Lake has resulted in an Evacuation Order of drill crews and other residents from the area on August 1 st. Due to the growth of the fire to about 9,400 hectares, the Evacuation Order was expanded during August to encompass the town of Gold Bridge and the area of the Reliance drill program. The Company's crew house and core-logging camp, core storage and diamond drill have not been damaged or affected by the fire. To assist the community and fire fighters in their effort, the Company and its contractor, Foraco Drilling, have contributed the temporary use of bulldozers, generators, water pumps, water hose, accommodation trailers, food and kitchen appliances. Cooler weather and rain provide the Company with encouragement that the evacuation order may be lifted soon, and it will be possible to resume drilling when it is deemed safe to return to work.</p><p>Endurance Gold Corporation is a company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of highly prospective North American mineral properties with the potential to develop world-class deposits.</p><p>ENDURANCE GOLD CORPORATION</p><p>Robert T.

Drilling was completed with NQ size tools capable of collecting 4.76 centimetre diameter core. NQ drill core was cut using a diamond saw with one half of the core sent for analysis and the remaining kept for future studies. All drill core samples have been submitted to ALS Global in North Vancouver, BC, an ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited laboratory, where they are crushed to 70% &lt;2 mm then up to 250 gram pulverized to &lt;75 microns. Samples are then submitted for four-acid digestion and analyzed for 48 element ICP-MS (ME-MS61) and gold 30g FA ICP-AES finish (AU-ICP21). Over limit samples returning greater than 10 parts per million (\" ppm\") gold are re-analyzed by Au-GRA21 methodology and over limit antimony returning greater than 10,000 ppm Sb are re-analyzed by Sb-AA08 methodology. Endurance Gold monitors QA/QC by inserting blanks, certified standards and pulp duplicates into the sample stream.

Assay results are reported herein for three additional holes drilled to define and expand the Eagle Zone. The Property is road accessible and located 4 kilometres (\"km\") east of the village of Gold Bridge, and 10 km north of the historic Bralorne-Pioneer Gold Mining Camp which has produced over 4 million ounces of gold.</p><p>This 2023 Eagle drilling is testing for down-dip and strike extensions of mineralization in the footwall of the Royal Shear fault that is blind to surface. All three drill holes reported herein have intersected significant gold mineralization. Highlights include: //st * DDH23-072 returned four significant intercepts including: 7.87 grams per tonne (\"gpt\") gold over 7.6 metres (\"m\"), 2.12 gpt gold over 10.5 m, 3.61 gpt gold over 2.5 m, and 1.62 gpt gold over 3.6 m. * DDH23-073 returned two intercepts including: 3.17 gpt gold over 4.0 m, and 1.92 gpt gold over 8.2 m. * DDH23-071 is the first drill hole completed in the Crown area and intersected the northwest extension of the Eagle Zone with 3.81 gpt gold over 3.4 m.</p><p>\"We are pleased to see the Eagle Zone expands to the northwest and continue to grow with significant intersections at depth. We have deliberately designed this program with large step-outs to significantly expand the mineralized system potential and it continues to deliver.\" stated Robert T. Boyd President and CEO of Endurance Gold Corporation \"The success statistics also continue to demonstrate the strength and growth potential of the Royal Shear Structure with 70% of the drill holes returned significant gold intercepts. We look forward to further drilling success.\"</p><p>Drilling has now been conducted at the Diplomat, Imperial and Eagle Zones with fourteen (14) holes completed so far in 2023 for over 4,000 m of the planned 15,000 m program. Assays are pending for two drill holes.</p><p>DDH23-072 was drilled at -45 degrees to test the southern-central area of Eagle and intersected four mineralized intervals starting at a downhole depth of 109.25 m. This drill hole was designed to test the width of the Eagle Zone at intermediate depth with a drill setup in the hanging wall in an area previously drill tested from the footwall by DDH22-027.</p><p>DDH23-073 was drilled at -65 degrees with the objective of delineating Eagle area mineralization between holes DDH23-072 and DDH23-070. DDH23-070 returned 7.91 gpt gold over 3.7 m and 1.79 gpt gold over 6.9 m as reported on August 3, 2023 representing the deepest intersection to date on the Eagle Zone.</p><p>DDH23-071, located 420 m northwest of DDH23-072, was drilled at -45 degrees and designed to test in the unexplored Crown area between the Eagle Zone and the Imperial Zone. This drill hole successfully intersected the Eagle Zone commencing at 211.15 m downhole depth, representing a significant 125 m northwest extension of the Eagle Zone along strike and at depth. As a result, the Eagle Zone has now been traced with drill holes over 550 m.</p><p>Results from 2023 diamond drilling are summarized in Table 1 and highlight intersections are shown on the Royal Shear plan map in Figure 1, the longitudinal section in Figure 2, and the Eagle cross section with two of the reported three holes in Figure 3.</p><p>This drilling demonstrates that the Eagle Zone mineralization is the most consistently mineralized structure currently identified at 550 m of trend, about 350 m downdip, or 250 m vertically below surface, and remains open to expansion at depth and along strike. Within the Eagle area, results from drilling to date indicate that two dominant mineralized structures referred to as Eagle South and Eagle Zone which are both southwest dipping and appear to be sub-parallel and separated by 60 to 80 m. In addition, a shallower dipping trend, the 020 Zone, links these two steeper dipping features. Ongoing drilling is testing the importance and continuity of these structures.</p><p>Since 2021, the Company has completed 73 diamond drill holes on the Reliance Property with 50 of these drill holes returning significant intersections of greater than 3 m width with grades exceeding 3.4 gpt gold, and twenty-three (23) of these drill holes with very high-quality intersections as summarized in Table 2. A complete tabulation of prior drill hole results for 2021 through 2022 is available on the Company website.</p><p>Forest Fire Update</p><p>A forest fire near the Company's crew house near Gun Lake has resulted in an Evacuation Order of drill crews and other residents from the area on August 1st. Due to the growth of the fire to about 9,400 hectares, the Evacuation Order was expanded during August to encompass the town of Gold Bridge and the area of the Reliance drill program. The Company's crew house and core-logging camp, core storage and diamond drill have not been damaged or affected by the fire. To assist the community and fire fighters in their effort, the Company and its contractor, Foraco Drilling, have contributed the temporary use of bulldozers, generators, water pumps, water hose, accommodation trailers, food and kitchen appliances. Cooler weather and rain provide the Company with encouragement that the evacuation order may be lifted soon, and it will be possible to resume drilling when it is deemed safe to return to work.</p><p>Endurance Gold Corporation is a company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of highly prospective North American mineral properties with the potential to develop world-class deposits.</p><p>ENDURANCE GOLD CORPORATION</p><p>Robert T.

Drilling was completed with NQ size tools capable of collecting 4.76 centimetre diameter core. NQ drill core was cut using a diamond saw with one half of the core sent for analysis and the remaining kept for future studies. All drill core samples have been submitted to ALS Global in North Vancouver, BC, an ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited laboratory, where they are crushed to 70% (2 mm then up to 250 gram pulverized to (75 microns. Samples are then submitted for four-acid digestion and analyzed for 48 element ICP-MS (ME-MS61) and gold 30g FA ICP-AES finish (AU-ICP21). Over limit samples returning greater than 10 parts per million (\"ppm\") gold are re-analyzed by Au-GRA21 methodology and over limit antimony returning greater than 10,000 ppm Sb are re-analyzed by Sb-AA08 methodology. Endurance Gold monitors QA/QC by inserting blanks, certified standards and pulp duplicates into the sample stream.

Just like the nightmare of 2003 Okanagan Mountain Fire, all local fire fighter units, RCMP, Central Okanagan Emergency Operations (ECO), and emergency rescue crews have answered the call \u2013 in turn been bolstered by a plethora of local volunteers.</p><p>Most impressive of all is the response of fire crews from out of town.</p><p>\u2018Miraculous\u2019 is a term used way too often, however, in the current scenario it is justified.</p><p>Without the huge number of forest fire foes frantically fighting flames for folks they have never met this fire would have burned out of control and done much greater damage that it has.</p><p>An impressive 31 municipalities have sent assistance to the West Kelowna, Central Okanagan electoral area, Lake Country and Kelowna fires allowing for attack and suppression squads of 500 firefighters during the day and a crew of 100 at night to battle the various blazes.</p><p>That overwhelming support has helped turn the fire back in many areas, saving thousands of homes and acres of land.</p><p>Earlier this week, it was nearly impossible to know when nighttime arrived as the skies were a dark black or thick gray all day from the various fires all around us.</p><p>Hardest hit is the North Westside area along Westside Road, where some 100 structures have been damaged.</p><p>In West Kelowna, the structure loss is estimated at 90.</p><p>I suppose, considering where we live and the heat wave we have just gone through, we should not be shocked with this environmental assault by Mother Nature.</p><p>We have been blessed by not having more lightning strikes and storms to work against us.</p><p>Some experts have suggested the weather should settle down this week and that the large fire crews now on hand will have the multiple spot fires under control.</p><p>That may be more wishful thinking than science speaking.</p><p>Regardless of weather reports, those operating the Central Okanagan Emergency Operations facilities are only allowing evacuees to return to their homes or properties when deemed absolutely safe.</p><p>Readers are begged to stay patient a bit longer and not add to the stress levels of those working the line.</p><p>If you know of anyone who may need a friendly couch or room, then please offer it to them.</p><p>My hat goes off to the many hotels, motels and businesses that are finding rooms for evacuees or out-of-town fire fighters.</p><p>There are so many volunteers, companies and individuals who are doing what they can to make these difficult times easier.</p><p>It makes me proud as a Kelowna resident to see people lending a caring hand and helping when needed like this.</p><p>Be very careful with your health. The air quality is terrible and dangerous, especially if you have asthma, emphysema, or a compromised respiratory system.</p><p>Be smart by being safe if the smoke in your area is heavy.</p><p>Stay inside.

The agency says wildfire smoke plumes moved into the impacted areas including the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Windsor, Barrie and London in Ontario and most of northern Quebec. </p><p><br/><br/> It says people with lung or heart disease, older adults, children and others are at higher risk of suffering adverse health effects of forest fires smoke.<br/><br/> The agency says wildfire pollution level can fluctuate over time and can vary depending on the location, but air quality was expected to improve for some areas on Thursday night.<br/><br/> Air quality warnings were also in effect in Chicago and Detroit and along with Toronto; they occupy three of the top four spots on Air-I-Q's global ranking for poor air quality. As of Wednesday morning, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates topped the list of major cities with a significant score of 411 - putting its air quality in the \"Hazardous\" category. Detroit ranked second, followed by Chicago, and Toronto in fourth, with an \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" rating of 159.<br/><br/> Still, some of the smaller communities in Southern Ontario are fairing far worse, with Sarnia scoring 372, as of 3:30 a.m., a score that places the city not far behind Dubai. Air-I-Q updates its numbers hourly.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre's website shows there were 487 active fires burning across the country, with 253 of them classified as out of control. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 66 active fires in Northern Ontario, and as of Wednesday morning, 76 fires were burning across Quebec. <br/><br/> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow.gov site warned everyone in Detroit \"should stay indoors and reduce activity levels.\" <br/><br/> \"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Detroit resident Darren Riley, who said he would wear a mask if he had to go outside at all on Wednesday.<br/><br/> In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors and pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"<br/><br/>U.S. President Joe Biden saw the impact first-hand Wednesday during a visit to Chicago, where he promoted his renewable energy policies during a major address on the economy. Biden has described the Canadian wildfires as clear evidence of climate change. <br/><br/> With files from <br/><br/> The Associated Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2023062968328691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K5-YW01-F197-537T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

the country that has left 20 dead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Civil protection ordered the evacuation of Ano Liosia in northwest Athens, a district of over 25,000 people while at the neighbouring community of Fyli an AFP journalist saw homes on fire.</p><p>Over 60 fires have erupted in the past 24 hours, and six countries were sending help via the European Union's civil protection mechanism, the fire department said, amid a dangerous mix of gale-force winds and temperatures of up to 41 degrees Celsius.</p><p>\"The situation is unprecedented, weather conditions are extreme,\" fire department spokesman Yiannis Artopios told state TV ERT, adding that the Tuesday fires \"grew to gigantic size\" in a short space of time.</p><p>The fire is burning the lower slopes of the Mount Parnitha, the largest forest bordering Athens, which has been burned several times.</p><p>Another big blaze was still raging at a landfill in the industrial zone of Aspropyrgos, west of Athens, covering the area in a noxious black cloud.</p><p>Over 40,000 hectares were destroyed in wildfires the three days from August 19 to 21, according to a report by the National Observatory of Athens.</p><p>\u2013 Suspected migrants found dead \u2013</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, eighteen suspected migrants were found dead in a forest fire near the Turkish border, north of the city of Alexandroupolis.Two children were among them, a police official said.</p><p>As no local residents had been reported missing \"the possibility that they are people who entered our country illegally is under investigation,\" fire department spokesman Yiannis Artopios said in a televised address.</p><p>The area is a frequent entry point for irregular migrants.</p><p>Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou expressed her deep sorrow.</p><p>'We must urgently take effective initiatives to ensure that this bleak reality does not become the new normality,' she said in a statement.</p><p>The latest deaths pushed the overall toll from this week's fires to 20.</p><p>Another suspected migrant was found dead in the area and an elderly shepherd was found dead north of Athens on Monday.</p><p>\"Greece is witnessing an unprecedented scale of wildfire devastation this summer and in such trying times the EU's swift assistance is vital,\" Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner

The agency says wildfire smoke plumes moved into the impacted areas including the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Windsor, Barrie and London in Ontario and most of northern Quebec. </p><p><br/><br/> It says people with lung or heart disease, older adults, children and others are at higher risk of suffering adverse health effects of forest fires smoke.<br/><br/> The agency says wildfire pollution level can fluctuate over time and can vary depending on the location, but air quality was expected to improve for some areas on Thursday night.<br/><br/> Air quality warnings were also in effect in Chicago and Detroit and along with Toronto; they occupy three of the top four spots on Air-I-Q's global ranking for poor air quality. As of Wednesday morning, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates topped the list of major cities with a significant score of 411 - putting its air quality in the \"Hazardous\" category. Detroit ranked second, followed by Chicago, and Toronto in fourth, with an \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" rating of 159.<br/><br/> Still, some of the smaller communities in Southern Ontario are fairing far worse, with Sarnia scoring 372, as of 3:30 a.m., a score that places the city not far behind Dubai. Air-I-Q updates its numbers hourly.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre's website shows there were 487 active fires burning across the country, with 253 of them classified as out of control. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 66 active fires in Northern Ontario, and as of Wednesday morning, 76 fires were burning across Quebec. <br/><br/> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow.gov site warned everyone in Detroit \"should stay indoors and reduce activity levels.\" <br/><br/> \"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Detroit resident Darren Riley, who said he would wear a mask if he had to go outside at all on Wednesday.<br/><br/> In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors and pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"<br/><br/>U.S. President Joe Biden saw the impact first-hand Wednesday during a visit to Chicago, where he promoted his renewable energy policies during a major address on the economy. Biden has described the Canadian wildfires as clear evidence of climate change. <br/><br/> With files from <br/><br/> The Associated Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PETEXM-2023062968328544</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PETEXM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K5-YW01-F197-536B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Peterborough Examiner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peterborough Examiner (Ontario)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

The agency says wildfire smoke plumes moved into the impacted areas including the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Windsor, Barrie and London in Ontario and most of northern Quebec. </p><p><br/><br/> It says people with lung or heart disease, older adults, children and others are at higher risk of suffering adverse health effects of forest fires smoke.<br/><br/> The agency says wildfire pollution level can fluctuate over time and can vary depending on the location, but air quality was expected to improve for some areas on Thursday night.<br/><br/> Air quality warnings were also in effect in Chicago and Detroit and along with Toronto; they occupy three of the top four spots on Air-I-Q's global ranking for poor air quality. As of Wednesday morning, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates topped the list of major cities with a significant score of 411 - putting its air quality in the \"Hazardous\" category. Detroit ranked second, followed by Chicago, and Toronto in fourth, with an \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" rating of 159.<br/><br/> Still, some of the smaller communities in Southern Ontario are fairing far worse, with Sarnia scoring 372, as of 3:30 a.m., a score that places the city not far behind Dubai. Air-I-Q updates its numbers hourly.<br/><br/> The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre's website shows there were 487 active fires burning across the country, with 253 of them classified as out of control. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 66 active fires in Northern Ontario, and as of Wednesday morning, 76 fires were burning across Quebec. <br/><br/> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow.gov site warned everyone in Detroit \"should stay indoors and reduce activity levels.\" <br/><br/> \"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Detroit resident Darren Riley, who said he would wear a mask if he had to go outside at all on Wednesday.<br/><br/> In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors and pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"<br/><br/>U.S. President Joe Biden saw the impact first-hand Wednesday during a visit to Chicago, where he promoted his renewable energy policies during a major address on the economy. Biden has described the Canadian wildfires as clear evidence of climate change. <br/><br/> With files from <br/><br/> The Associated Press<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2023062968328946</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K5-YW01-F197-5394-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

There will still be pizza available on Fridays. <br/><br/> We are in need of kitchen volunteers. You can pick a time slot Monday to Friday, with the morning shift from 9 to 11:30 a.m. or the afternoon shift from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. If you feel that you have some time to offer once a week or a couple of times a month, please contact Kathleen Dennis, volunteer co-ordinator at 905-873-2600 ext. 2282.<br/><br/> The last bingo for the summer will be on Monday, July 17. We are giving the organizers a break for the month of August.<br/><br/> Hey, this sounds delicious - a world food tour right in our own backyard. July will be a Canada-themed menu. Maryse, a Hillsview member, and sous chef Cindy will work with a small group to create a meal. We will taste one and take one home. Space is limited. The dates are Tuesday, July 11 and Thursday, Aug. 24.<br/><br/> Keeping with a Canada-themed menu, first up will be Canada Tourtiere Pie, Waldorf salad, and dessert. Next month we will visit Greece, with chicken souvlaki with tzatziki.<br/><br/> The Centre will be closed on Monday, July 3 to celebrate Canada Day. Show your pride by wearing your red and white the week leading up to Canada Day.<br/><br/> There will be a joint men's and women's breakfast on Wednesday, July 19. Sign up and pay at reception. Come out and enjoy a breakfast of eggs, home fries, sausage, and bacon, with toast and jam and lots of coffee. What a great way to meet and socialize with others.<br/><br/> We are offering a Mandala Rock Art Workshop. It will be held on Tuesday, July 25, from 1 to 2:30 p.m. You will find a description of this art form on page 17 of the Hillsview Magazine. All materials are provided and you will be led through the process by staff from the Royal Academy and Art2Go.<br/><br/> Check out the travel desk for upcoming trips.

And a forecast model suggested fire hot spots were unlikely to receive the more significant precipitation expected farther south over the next few days, he added.</p><p>\u201cThere has been a bit of help from the rain for those battling forest fires, but unfortunately those fires continue,\u201d Flisfeder said. Areas most affected by fires received between 15 and 40 millimetres of rain between Sunday and Wednesday, with possibly higher amounts in localized areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, wildfire smoke led the federal weather agency this week to issue special air quality statements for all of southern Ontario and much of western Quebec. The meteorologists said they expected air quality in the Montreal area to worsen as that smoke moved into the city by Wednesday evening.</p><p>Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency reported 110 active fires Wednesday afternoon, including 73 in the southern half of the province. It has said that lightning is the cause of the majority of fires in the province this year.</p><p>Several communities in northern and western Quebec were still under evacuation orders due to fires and smoke, though residents of the town of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon and the Cree community of Mistissini will be able to return home this week, officials have announced. Mistissini lifted its evacuation order Tuesday evening.</p><p>Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re said Wednesday that recent temperatures and a favourable weather outlook for July made it possible for the community to begin a gradual return after their second evacuation in a month. Members of the general public are scheduled to begin coming back starting Saturday, he said.</p><p>However, fires still pose a threat to the town, the mayor said, adding that a third evacuation is still possible.</p><p>\u201cThere is a risk of fires coming back in full force in July,\u201d he warned. \u201cHowever, we think it would be unrealistic to wait until all of these fires are under control because we\u2019d still be evacuated for four to six weeks.\u201d</p><p>Almost 1,200 vulnerable people from Cree communities, including Mistissini, are among the evacuees.</p><p>Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost of the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay said the evacuation process has gone relatively well, but he added that the situation poses particular health, logistical and cultural challenges for evacuees \u2014 including elders, medical patients, pregnant women and infants \u2014 who have been transferred across hotels and healthcare facilities in Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec City and Saguenay.</p><p>He likened the evacuation to \u201cgoing camping without prior notice,\u201d uprooting people from their homes and lands.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230629RDA0003687998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K5-FJM1-F0HF-80MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Terrace, B.C., was his next scheduled stop on Aug. 23, and Yukon on Aug. 24. </p><p>All three have been postponed. </p><p>\u201cDue to severe wildfires, and the devastation and disruption they are causing to those affected by emergency evacuation orders, we have made the decision to cancel planned events and postpone them to a future date,\u201d reads an online update for the Yukon rally. </p><p>Former federal environment minister Catherine McKenna posted a screenshot of an email telling Conservative party supporters the Yukon \u201cAxe the Tax\u201d rally is postponed until further notice. </p><p>\u201cAs fires burn and Canadians are displaced across the country, Pierre Poilievre is touring the country saying we don't need real climate action,\u201d said federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson in a Aug. 20 Tweet. </p><p>\u201cThis isn't the leadership that Canadians want. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d </p><p>Climate change \u2014 driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas \u2014 is a key factor in increasing wildfire risk. Climate change is bringing more storms and lightning strikes that start fires, hot conditions dry up organic matter into perfect forest fire fuel and arid, windy weather fans the flames. </p><p>The federal carbon price creates a financial incentive for businesses and individuals to pollute less by putting a price on each tonne of carbon dioxide, or equivalent greenhouse gases, emitted when fossil fuels are consumed. </p><p>\u201cWe are still waiting for any kind of climate plan from Pierre Poilievre,\u201d said Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault in an emailed statement to Canada\u2019s National Observer. \u201cWhile the Conservative party still debates whether climate change is real, the world is on fire,\u201d the statement reads. </p><p>\u201cMr. Poilievre is forced to cancel events due to climate-fuelled catastrophes but he still can\u2019t bring himself to face reality,\u201d said Guilbeault, adding that putting a price on pollution is a key part of the federal government\u2019s plan to \u201cbuild a country with sustainable jobs, strong communities and thriving natural beauty.\u201d </p><p>Poilievre\u2019s team did not respond to requests for comment by publication time. </p><p>One of Poilievre\u2019s most common talking points is that he will axe Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax if he becomes prime minister. He hammers the carbon price at every opportunity, tying it to the affordability crisis and telling Canadians eliminating it will lower prices. </p><p>More frequent storms, extreme weather and heat waves made worse by climate change are capable of causing billions of dollars worth of damage to infrastructure. The cost of rebuilding B.C. after the historic 2021 floods is near $9 billion, according to analysis done by the Globe and Mail. </p><p>In 2021, the Canadian Climate Institute found health impacts from climate change could cost Canada's health-care system billions of dollars and the economy to the tune of tens of billions in coming decades. Shortly after those findings were published, Western Canada experienced an extreme heat wave that killed 619 people between June 25 and July 1, according to the BC Coroners Service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-37843eceb24b493284b6fc782555e703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690X-8D11-DY9S-T0CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><timeReceived>09:03 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 22, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
