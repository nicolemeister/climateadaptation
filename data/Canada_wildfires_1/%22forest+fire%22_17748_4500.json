Even the moniker \"Crappy Tire\" tends to be used affectionately. Yet behind the scenes, the folksy chain has undergone a rapid transformation into a tech-forward, digital analytics-driven omnichannel powerhouse whose sales last year soared by 18 per cent, including a nearly 200 per cent spike in e-commerce. Greg Hicks admits this is not what he expected when he took the company's helm literally on the eve of the largest retail disruption in living memory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's almost exactly the one-year mark of your tenure as CEO, so happy anniversary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yeah. Seems like five years.</p><p>When did you realize this was going to be a year like no other?</p><p>The night before the CEO announcement the NBA cancelled the season and the day after the WHO declared a global pandemic. But at that point we were somewhat naive as to the severity of the situation. A couple days later, we were closing the offices and five days later we were shutting more than 1,000 stores. We played defence for six months where you're just reacting.</p><p>How did you mobilize? Did you have war rooms to manage the response?</p><p>We had an enterprise risk committee in place that would usually deal with isolated disasters like a flood or forest fire and there is a playbook you can pull out. In three days we realized that was not going to work, so we expanded the \"nerve centre\" to the top 35 or 40 leaders and for months we were meeting multiple times a day. In the early days, the head of the risk committee was playing point on required decisions and we literally knocked them down like dominoes one by one.</p><p>Despite all that, you've had an outstanding year, largely by effectively tapping e-commerce. That was a channel where you had long lagged other retailers.</p><p>We were in the process of methodical investment in our websites. Having demand accelerate the way it did certainly caught us by surprise and we had our share of hiccups, but the foundation we were building enabled us to respond quickly. First, we chose which parts of the website to own versus partner on. Sounds like a simple idea but those were critical decisions. We had been a build-from-within organization for a long time, but we brought in a new site search partner, a product recommendations engine and a site personalization engine. Second, we invested heavily in the Triangle (rewards program) and Canadian Tire app. Finally, and this one was key, we in-sourced in late 2019 our digital marketing capability, creating a centralized team of experts.</p><p>Our physical store reach also helped us thrive. Those assets are often overlooked when thinking about readiness for battle in e-commerce. But think of it this way: We had 22 million square feet of warehouse space that sits within a 10-minute drive of 90 per cent of Canadians, and those warehouses happen to have 25 million square feet of product showrooms attached to them where you can walk out with the product that day.</p><p>Wait: you think of your stores as showrooms now?</p><p>Traditionally no, but we're trying to find a way to explain why people shouldn't be surprised that we continue to thrive. The pandemic has solidified the fact that the physical store is absolutely critical. It allows us to present and merchandise inspiration in a way an online pure play can't, and it can be the epicentre of fulfilment. Whether we knew it or not, we've been getting ready for this consumer shift for a year. We're a much more digital company than we were 12 months ago.</p><p>What lessons from this past year are you going to take into the future?</p><p>The biggest is how powerful it is to embrace progress over perfection. In crisis management, there just isn't time for the meeting before the meeting and the meeting after meeting, the hierarchies, the egos. The workplace is another obvious place to talk about. Flexibility is the new F word, and flexibility about where people work is here to stay. The next big adjustment will involve technology. No longer will technology be viewed as a separate function. Virtually every company is now a technology company.</p><p>Canadian Tire owns other retail banners, including SportChek, Mark's, Pro Hockey Life. Party City is puzzling. How does it fit in?</p><p>I've gotten that perplexed question before. This is the first time customer data shaped our acquisition target. The data from our Triangle program and credit card business showed us that Party City's customers skewed young and spent 60 per cent more at Canadian Tire than our average Triangle member.</p><p>Party City has a small footprint in Canada, but the people who live in those markets, who have our credit card, who are members of our program, can earn and redeem Canadian Tire money, and that kind of earn-and-burn cycle helps drive a flywheel of loyalty to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>In retail, experience and gut have long ruled decision making. How do you strike the balance between that human acumen and data analytics?</p><p>A big chunk of my career was on the merchant side and there's a lot of intuition there. Now, \"I think\" is diminishing in our vocabulary and moving to \"I know\" because we have so much data and there is little room for subjectivity. Few meaningful decision-making protocols don't still have a mix of art and science, but some we once thought were exclusively art, like margin management, have surprised even the most devoutly old-school merchants. What I love about empirical data is that it can snap a debate into focus, as when a dealer is wondering whether they should take a deeper position in a certain category.</p><p>You have deep personal roots in that dealer network.</p><p>Yes. My father was an officer of the company and went on to become a dealer. I had two uncles who were dealers and I worked in my dad's store. We had this cubbyhole underneath his office where you mixed paint for customers and he showed me how to use the machine and 10 minutes later I was working the paint aisle. I was maybe 15.</p><p>You've compared running Canadian Tire to nation building. The chain may be a fixture, but is that a stretch?</p><p>Canada is just over 150 years old and we will celebrate our 100-year anniversary next year, so in a way we grew up with Canada. The way our history and values evolved have largely reflected Canadian values that are so different from our neighbours to the south and one substantial difference is the value we place on community over individual.</p><p>Many people have gizmos they never thought existed or they needed until they spotted them at Canadian Tire. What's your favourite?</p><p>Oh, I love the little Noma humidifiers that sit on your desk. When I'm on hockey road trips with the kids or sleeping in hotels, I take them with me. Every house should have 10.</p><p>The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210320TTA2021032060475409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:627Y-P531-JDV5-F36H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

So we're able to get in front of the fire now, get on the offensive.\"</p><p>Other workers echoed McLean's comments, saying cooler temperatures and mild winds have finally offered them a chance to make progress.</p><p>The weather is expected to remain benign for the next week, although any deterioration in conditions after that could see the wildfires flare up again.</p><p>While battling the blazes, volunteer firefighting veteran Mick Stain found some moth larvae, or \"witchetty grubs,\" and turned them into what's known in Australia as bush tucker by roasting them directly on the fire's burning coals.</p><p>\"Bit creamy and nutty, but they're all right,\" Stain said. \"They're not spew-worthy, so they're pretty good.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. tennis star Serena Williams donated her $43,000 winner's check from New Zealand's ASB Classic to the fundraising appeal for victims of the wildfires, joining many other tennis stars to pledge money, including Ash Barty, Nick Kygrios, Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova.</p><p>Also on Sunday, news came that another firefighter had been killed. Bill Slade - one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia - died after being hit by a falling tree on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state, Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said.</p><p>The 60-year-old married father of two was commended in November for 40 years of service with the forestry agency.</p><p>\"Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can't be predicted,\" Hardman said.</p><p>\"Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic, high-risk environment and it carries with it significant risk.\"</p><p>The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area larger than the U.S. state of Indiana since September. Four of the casualties have been firefighters.</p><p>The crisis has brought accusations that Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government needs to take more action to counter climate change, which experts say has worsened the blazes.</p><p>Thousands of protesters rallied Friday in Sydney and Melbourne, calling for Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take tougher action on global warming.</p><p>The prime minister said Sunday that his government was building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change.</p><p>He said the government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework within the Department of Home Affairs that will deal with wildfires, cyclones, floods and drought.</p><p>\"This is a longer-term risk framework model which deals with one of the big issues in response to the climate changing,\" Morrison said.</p><p>He said his government accepted that climate change was leading to longer, hotter and drier summers, despite junior government lawmaker George Christensen posting on social media over the weekend that the cause of the latest fires was arson rather than man-made climate change.

So do we need to buy new fighter jets? Richard Shimooka and Bianca Mugyenyi discuss in this week's debate.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that government preparation is essential to successfully navigate unexpected crises. Yet, despite the experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak, successive governments failed have to maintain key capabilities and knowledge, leading to a lacklustre response in the early days of the pandemic. An obvious parallel exists with the recent debate over the need for a fighter aircraft in Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A standing military is tasked with safeguarding the country's domestic sovereignty and territorial integrity. With climate change opening up access to the north, and Russia investing heavily in Arctic capabilities, the challenges facing Canada's sovereignty in the Far North are not abating. No serious state abrogates its core responsibilities towards defending its own territory. Even Switzerland, a country with a strict neutrality policy, maintains a strong military to protect its sovereignty.</p><p>However, Canada's situation is complicated by its proximity to the United States. Despite recent challenges with the Trump administration, no other country enjoys a stronger political, economic and military relationship with the U.S.</p><p>Yet, Canada also represents the biggest vulnerability to our neighbour. The shortest aerial route from China and Russia to strike the U.S. is through Canadian territory. As such, the idea that Canada can somehow disentangle itself from the United States, either by demilitarization or by decoupling its political alliance, is a fallacy that would only result in an immense geopolitical win for our adversaries.</p><p>Conversely, Ottawa's close ties to Washington often leads some to assume Canada does not need to spend on defence, instead relying on the U.S. to defend Canada's territory. Yet this would basically result in the U.S. either dictating our security decisions or taking a much tougher line on bilateral relations.</p><p>Canada also needs to maintain a competent military to safeguard our interests abroad. The country's prosperity was founded on a stable international order, and states can and do use military force to impose their interests - as shown by Russia's incursion into Crimea and Ukraine and China's belligerence towards Taiwan and Japan.</p><p>Canadian prime ministers have long affirmed this view, but the country has, on occasion, bumped against the limits of contributing too little. In 1969, Pierre Trudeau unilaterally slashed Canada's contribution to NATO, partly on the belief that military force was no longer as salient.</p><p>This was greeted with consternation by allies, but especially West Germany - to the extent that it linked the signing of future trade deals with Canada increasing its defence contribution to Europe. Trudeau Sr. reassessed his initial policies and later embarked on a major military rearmament program, which included purchasing the CF-18s we use today.</p><p>Yet what mix of forces best suits Canada's needs today? The country has the world's second largest land mass but the 37th largest population. It is utterly impractical to defend the country with only ships or ground troops; fighter aircraft are the only real solution to successfully deter incursions of the country's vast territory. The total cost of the amortized acquisition of the fighter force and its operation is roughly $2.5 billion a year, or about 0.15 per cent of Canada's annual GDP.</p><p>Air power is also arguably the most responsive capability the military has today. In addition to its North American duties, Canada regularly deploys CF-18s to defend our allies abroad in Eastern Europe, for instance.</p><p>Fighter aircraft, and air power more broadly, are considered an essential capability. Militaries require a broad spectrum of capabilities to operate effectively and neglecting one area over others creates serious vulnerabilities.</p><p>New technologies have also emerged in the past few decades, including cyber warfare, hypersonic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. This has led some to question the utility of fighter aircraft. Yet 12 next generation fighter programs are currently underway among nine countries. Simply put, manned fighters are here to stay for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Importantly, Canada's fighter force is in dire need of replacement. The CF-18s are already a decade past their expected lifespan and cannot be expected to last more than five to 10 additional years. Our allies have taken note and have pushed for Canada to make a decision.</p><p>The CF-18 replacement saga has some parallels to the lack of pre-pandemic planning. Unlike COVID, however, the security challenges and needs facing Canada are quite visible to even casual observers of the news today. We ignore it at our peril.</p><p>Richard Shimooka is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't want to miss the next Saturday Debate? Sign up here and we'll let you know when it's online.</emphasis></p><p>Even before the UN labelled climate change \"code red for humanity\" and a virus upended our lives, it was a bad idea to spend huge sums on new warplanes. But now the \"security\" argument is wholly untenable. Procuring cutting edge new fighter jets will simply line the pockets of arms manufacturers while strengthening the air force's ability to fight in aggressive U.S. and NATO led wars.</p><p>The federal government plans to spend $19 billion on 88 new fighter jets. But that's just the sticker price. The full life cycle cost is expected to reach $77 billion.</p><p>These resources could be directed toward more socially useful endeavours, from ensuring all reserves have healthy drinking water, to building social housing and turbocharging a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Instead, the heavy carbon emitting fighter jets will lock in fossil fuel militarism for decades after the government has committed to reach net zero in its operations. Incredibly, the greenhouse gases emitted by fighter jets aren't included in the calculation since the military is exempt from emission reduction targets even though it accounts for 59 per cent of federal government GHGs.</p><p>While worsening the climate crisis, new fighter jets are not needed to protect Canadians. When the procurement process began, former deputy minister of national defence Charles Nixon argued that next generation fighter jets \"are not required to protect Canada's populace or sovereignty.\" He pointed out they would be largely useless in dealing with an attack like 9/11, responding to natural disasters, providing international humanitarian relief or in peacekeeping operations. Plus, you can't bomb a virus or forest fire.</p><p>Useless in dealing with looming security threats, fighter jets effectively funnel public resources into corporate pockets. Even though Justin Trudeau repeatedly promised not to purchase Lockheed Martin's F-35 prior to being elected, the government has quietly spent hundreds of millions of dollars to remain part of the consortium developing the $1.7 trillion stealth fighter so Canadian firms can continue to profit from the gargantuan corporate handout. The Liberals will likely break their promise and select the F-35 when the final decision is made later this year.</p><p>As is normal in the military-industrial complex, all three firms (Boeing, Saab and Lockheed) vying to build Canada's new fighter jets have offices only blocks from Parliament Hill. These manufacturers also hire former top soldiers and make funds available to think tanks that promote their interests.</p><p>Proponents of new fighter jets repeat over and over: Canada has made commitments to NATO and NORAD, which protect us from the Russians, Chinese and other aggressors.</p><p>But there's nothing \"defensive\" about military alliances with a country former president Jimmy Carter called \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"</p><p>The U.S. has over 800 international military bases and its special forces are stationed in three quarters of the world's nations. Regarding Russia, NATO has troops in a handful of bordering states with Canadians stationed in Latvia and Ukraine, as well as Air Force and Navy assets regularly rotating through Romania and the Baltic and Black seas.</p><p>For its part, China is encircled by tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand and Guam, as well as the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Canadian naval vessels have recently patrolled the South China Sea and the military has sought a small base in Singapore, according to Canadian Press, \"to support the United States' 'pivot' toward Asia to counter a rising China.\"</p><p>Cutting edge new fighter jets are not designed to defend Canada from China or Russia but rather to increase the Canadian military's capacity to rain bombs on countries, often in the Global South, in U.S.-led wars. Over the past three decades Canadian fighter jets have bombed Iraq, Serbia, Libya and Iraq/Syria. Many innocent civilians were killed directly or due to the destruction of infrastructure.</p><p>In perhaps the most egregious example, Canadian fighter jets bombed Libya in 2011 against the wishes of the African Union, which opposed the NATO campaign led by a Canadian general. An upsurge in anti-Blackness, including slave markets, subsequently appeared in Libya and violence quickly spilled southward to Mali and across much of Africa's Sahel.</p><p>Spending tens of billions of dollars in order to be able to bomb largely Black and brown people living in countries thousands of kilometres away does not make Canadians more secure. We can find far better uses for our tax dollars.</p><p>Bianca Mugyenyi is the director of the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-news20210814TTAW48e92bc0fe034a30a4661b2768c357c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CF-V2P1-F197-5189-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

So we're able to get in front of the fire now, get on the offensive.\"</p><p>Other workers echoed McLean's comments, saying cooler temperatures and mild winds have finally offered them a chance to make progress.</p><p>The weather is expected to remain benign for the next week, although any deterioration in conditions after that could see the wildfires flare up again.</p><p>While battling the blazes, volunteer firefighting veteran Mick Stain found some moth larvae, or \"witchetty grubs,\" and turned them into what's known in Australia as bush tucker by roasting them directly on the fire's burning coals.</p><p>\"Bit creamy and nutty, but they're all right,\" Stain said. \"They're not spew-worthy, so they're pretty good.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. tennis star Serena Williams donated her $43,000 winner's check from New Zealand's ASB Classic to the fundraising appeal for victims of the wildfires. Many other tennis stars have pledged money, including Ash Barty, Nick Kygrios, Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova.</p><p>Also on Sunday, news came that another firefighter had been killed. Bill Slade - one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia - died after being hit by a falling tree on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state, Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said.</p><p>The 60-year-old married father of two was commended in November for 40 years of service with the forestry agency.</p><p>\"Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can't be predicted,\" Hardman said.</p><p>\"Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic, high-risk environment and it carries with it significant risk.\"</p><p>The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area larger than the U.S. state of Indiana since September. Four of the casualties have been firefighters.</p><p>The crisis has brought accusations that Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government needs to take more action to counter climate change, which experts say has worsened the blazes.</p><p>Thousands of protesters rallied Friday in Sydney and Melbourne, calling for Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take tougher action on global warming.</p><p>The prime minister said Sunday his government was building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change.</p><p>He said the government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework that will deal with wildfires, cyclones, floods and drought.</p><p>\"This is a longer-term risk framework model which deals with one of the big issues in response to the climate changing,\" Morrison said.</p><p>He said his government accepted that climate change was leading to longer, hotter and drier summers, despite junior government lawmaker George Christensen posting on social media over the weekend that the cause of the latest fires was arson rather than man-made climate change.</p><p>State authorities say a minority of fires are deliberately lit.</p><p>\"Our party room has a broad range of views,\" Morrison said of those within government ranks who reject mainstream climate science.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2020011356852705</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYV-D481-F103-32H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Vayu builds high-performance vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) hybrid propulsion-based, autonomous aircraft. Its customers and partners range from public and private entities in Australia, Canada and sub-Saharan Africa in a variety of sectors - from critical medical supply transport to infrastructure inspection. Vayu represents Alpine 4's second recent acquisition in the fast-growing UAV space and will serve as a vital addition to the platform capabilities of Impossible Aerospace. The shareholders of Vayu are primarily leading venture capitalists and angel investors, including Tesla Motors founder's Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and Cosmonaut Esther Dyson, as well as public health experts. Like Impossible Aerospace, the transaction will be completed in a reverse triangular merger with a newly formed subsidiary of Alpine 4. Upon meeting the final closing conditions, Vayu will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpine 4. Vayu and Alpine 4 expect to have the closing conditions met by January 10th, 2021. Daniel Pepper, the current CEO of Vayu, will continue on in his role as CEO.</p><p/><p>Strategic Rationale</p><p>Kent Wilson, CEO of Alpine 4, had this to say, \"I cannot say enough about Vayu and why I absolutely love this company. Their mission is resolute and purposeful. Their X5, G1 and G2 aircraft are designed to deliver lifesaving medicine and technology to people within inaccessible areas of developing countries, as well as hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities in the U.S. The mission-driven purpose of it alone is even more significant than its dollar value. When you look at the evolving landscape of the commercial UAV industry, you see an abundance of opportunities for Vayu's family of VTOL aircraft. Its seven years of expertise combines not only core technologies advantages but also invaluable market insights.</p><p>Wilson added: \"Vayu's platforms complement the multicopters from Impossible Aerospace. Both Vayu and Impossible Aerospace have unique qualities that make their respective platforms advantageous and complementary, depending on the requirements of the end-user. Combining these two companies into the Alpine 4 portfolio of subsidiaries gives us a wider and larger scope of commercial clients and positions the company to capture a large market share of the commercial drone industry.\"</p><p>Daniel Pepper, CEO of Vayu, said, \"This represents the beginning of a new chapter in Vayu's story. The company began in response to an acute need of tremendous magnitude: solving some of the hardest logistical challenges for delivering medical care, anywhere in the world. Over the years Vayu's capabilities have grown in size and capability, and in direct response to an enormous amount of customer and stakeholder engagement. Platforms such as the G1 and the G2 are virtually unmatched in the civilian market, yet their demand is as critical as ever. Whether it is for maritime surveillance, forest fire monitoring, linear asset inspection, or the primary and core use case of medical delivery, Vayu's opportunity set is wide, diverse, and growing. In the years to come, Vayu will further expand its offerings to a range of customers, ever expanding its payload and range capabilities, while further investing in its autopilot and avionics expertise to further safety, reliability, and autonomy.\"</p><p>Transaction highlights include: //st * Advanced UAV autopilot software: The acquisition of Vayu will allow Alpine 4 to incorporate Vayu's highly advanced and rugged autopilot company-wide for other applications such as with Impossible Aerospace's US-1 drone. * Large Medical Market Opportunities: The rural medical markets of 'last mile' and 'middle mile' delivery that can be supported by Vayu's drone technology are large and growing. Vayu's G1 has a payload of 12lb while its G2 aircraft has a payload capacity of up to 44lbs. * Vertical Manufacturing: Having Vayu within the portfolio of Alpine 4 companies will add more integration opportunities with our subsidiary Quality Circuit Assembly and have cross-pollination manufacturing opportunities for the team at Vayu.</p><p>Vayu builds high-performance gas/electric VTOL aircraft that save lives. Founded in 2014 by Daniel Pepper, the company unveiled its X5 in 2016, and its G1 and G2 aircraft in 2020. Vayu's mission is to solve the hardest and most critical logistics challenges, anywhere in the world, aiming to set the standard and lead the market in safe, reliable, and autonomous VTOL aircraft.</p><p>ABC News: <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/doctors-drones-drop-medical-sup\">https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/doctors-drones-drop-medical-sup</url> plies-madagascar-46880863</p><p>X5 Vayu: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Z\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Z</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vayu.us\">https://www.vayu.us</url>/</p><p>Alpine 4:</p><p>Four principles at the core of our business are Synergy.

After two weeks, the vessels and helicopter will head out to sea where they will be ready to respond to a domestic emergency as needed.</p><p>\"This option gives us the best chance of avoiding a community spread within one of the ships should someone have contracted the virus at the last minute due to natural family interactions,\" he said in his letter.</p><p>\"I recognize this decision will be very challenging for our sailors and their families. In many ways, it will be like they have left on deployment, while in reality they will be very close by.\"</p><p>The U.S. Navy has seen COVID-19 infections on two of its nuclear-powered aircraft carriers over the past week, where close quarters have allowed the illness to spread like wildfire among the crew.</p><p>Baines could not say how long the Ville de Quebec and Moncton would remain at sea, suggesting it would largely depend on the pandemic.</p><p>The sequestration order came as the federal government promised the military is ready to respond should a formal request for assistance come from a province, territory or municipality, whether it is to help with COVID-19 or a natural disaster such as a flood.</p><p>\"To date, the federal government has received no requests for action from the provinces or territories,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in French during the daily news conference outside his Ottawa home on Monday.</p><p>\"If that were to change, the Armed Forces would be ready to answer the call as they have done throughout our history, whether it is to transport medical equipment or protect your homes during the flood or forest-fire season. Those who wear the uniform will be there for you.\"</p><p>Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan later revealed Ottawa is ready to mobilize up to 24,000 Canadian troops to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. That represents about a quarter of the entire force and would be one of the largest peacetime mobilizations in Canadian history.</p><p>Those on standby include 10 Canadian Army units as well as Navy ships and Air Force aircraft and crew. Reservists and Canadian Rangers are also being put on notice, Sajjan said, with the Rangers ready to conduct patrols to northern and Indigenous communities.</p><p>\"These flexible teams are capable of operating as local response forces to assist with humanitarian support, wellness checks, natural disaster response and other tasks as required,\" said Sajjan, adding requests for assistance will be prioritized based on need.</p><p>The minister added that the government has been in touch with some remote communities to assess their needs. The military has in recent years provided assistance, including evacuations due to flooding and forest fires, to Indigenous communities and others in the north. </p><p>Sajjan also left the door open to military personnel helping enforce quarantines while chief of the defence staff Gen. Jonathan Vance said the Armed Forces could provide medical support and engineers if required.</p><p>Vance last week essentially put all Canadian military personnel on a war footing by telling them to stay healthy and be ready to respond. He also asked members who were in the process of voluntarily leaving the Forces to reconsider and encouraged veterans to rejoin.</p><p>Meanwhile, military commanders have been working to be ready to help with COVID-19 at the same time as they could also be asked to respond to natural disasters, with many communities across Canada having experienced extreme springtime flooding over the past few years.</p><p>Yet the force is also being asked to maintain its presence in several overseas missions while guarding against any potential attack.</p><p>The federal government is looking at all its overseas missions and making adjustments where needed, Sajjan said. It is also working closely with its allies and \"looking at any adversaries that might take advantage of the situation.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-cff59cfdae104baca38910ad167c141e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJG-FKC1-JBVR-3047-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><timeReceived>03:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 30, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(TSXV: ILC) (the \"Company\" or \"ILC\") is pleased to announce that it has closed the first tranche of its non-brokered private placement (the \"Private Placement\") of units (\"Unit\") announced on July 15, 2021. On closing, the Company issued 8,966,667 Units at CAD $0.06 per Unit for proceeds of CAD $538,000. Each Unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one additional common share at an exercise price of CAD $0.08 per common share until June 30, 2024. </p><p><br/>The proceeds of the Private Placement will be used for exploration on the Company's Raleigh Lake Project and for general corporate and administrative costs. All Private Placement securities will be restricted from trading for a period of four months plus one day from the date of closing. <br/>No finder's fees were paid on this tranche of the transaction. <br/>John Wisbey, Chairman and CEO of the Company, commented, \"This placing continues the successful fundraising conducted earlier this year, and allows us to continue work on our lithium and rubidium deposit at Raleigh Lake soon after the current forest fire prevention restrictions in that part of Ontario are lifted.\" <br/>Certain directors and officers participated in this tranche of the Private Placement. The issuance of private placement securities to non-arms' length parties constitutes related-party transactions under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). Because the Company's shares trade only on the TSX Venture Exchange, the issuance of securities is exempt from the formal valuation requirements of Section 5.4 of MI 61-101 pursuant to Subsection 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 and exempt from the minority approval requirements of Section 5.6 of MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.7(b). The Company did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the closing of the private placement as the details of the participation of insiders of the Company had not been confirmed at that time. <br/>About International Lithium Corp.<br/>International Lithium Corp. believes that the '20s will be the decade of battery metals, at a time that the world faces a significant turning point in the energy market's dependence on oil and gas and in the governmental and public view of climate change. Our key mission in the new decade is to make money for our shareholders from lithium and battery metals while at the same time helping to create a greener, cleaner planet. This includes optimizing the value of our existing projects in Canada, Argentina and Ireland as well as finding, exploring and developing projects that have the potential to become world class lithium and rare metal deposits. In addition, we have seen the clear and growing wish by the USA and Canada to safeguard their supplies of critical battery metals, and our Canadian properties are strategic in that respect.  <br/>A key goal is to become a well funded company to turn our aspirations into reality. <br/>International Lithium Corp. has a significant portfolio of projects, strong management, and strong partners. Partners include Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd., (\"Ganfeng Lithium\") a leading China-based lithium product manufacturer quoted on the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges (A share code: 002460, H share code: 1772) and Essential Metals Limited, quoted on the Australian Stock exchange. <br/>The Company's primary strategic focus is now on the Raleigh Lake lithium and rubidium project in Canada and on the Company's strategic options on the Mariana project in Argentina. In respect of the latter, the Company has announced that its board believes it to be in the best interests of the Company to sell its stake in Mariana before the next capital intensive stage of the project gets underway. <br/>The Raleigh Lake project consists of 3,027 hectares of adjoining mineral claims in Ontario, and is regarded by ILC management as ILC's most significant project in Canada. The pegmatites explored there contain significant quantities of rubidium and caesium as well as lithium. Raleigh Lake is 100% owned by ILC, is not subject to any encumbrances, and is royalty free.  <br/>Current ownership of the Mariana lithium-potash brine project is through a joint venture company, Litio Minera Argentina S. A. (\"LMA\"), a private company registered in Argentina. At December 31, 2020, LMA was owned 88.4% by Ganfeng Lithium and 11.6% by ILC (percentages are subject to audit). As at mid 2021 and subject to further audit, the Company's share had been diluted to around 10%. In addition, ILC currently has an option to acquire a further 10% in LMA through a back-in right. The Mariana project is located within the renowned South American \"Lithium Belt\" that is the host to the vast majority of global lithium resources, reserves and production. The Mariana project strategically encompasses an entire mineral rich evaporite basin, totalling 160 square kilometres, and has over 7,800,000 tonnes of Measured and Indicated Lithium Chloride equivalent resource, ranking it as one of the more prospective salars or 'salt lakes' in the region.  <br/>Complementing the Company's lithium brine project at Mariana and rare metal pegmatite property at Raleigh Lake, are interests in two other rare metal pegmatite properties in Ontario, Canada known as the Mavis Lake and Forgan Lake projects, and the Avalonia project in Ireland, which encompasses an extensive 50-km-long pegmatite belt. <br/>The ownership of the Mavis Lake project is now 51% Essential Metals Limited (\"ESS\") and 49% ILC. In addition, ILC owns a 1.5% NSR on Mavis Lake. ESS has an option to earn an additional 29% by sole-funding a further CAD $8.5 million expenditures of exploration activities, at which time the ownership will be 80% ESS and 20% ILC.  <br/>The Forgan Lake project will, upon Ultra Resources Inc. meeting its contractual requirements pursuant to its agreement with ILC, become 100% owned by Ultra Resources, and ILC will retain a 1.5% NSR on Forgan Lake. <br/>The ownership of the Avalonia project is currently 55% Ganfeng Lithium and 45% ILC. Ganfeng Lithium has an option to earn an additional 24% by either incurring CAD $10 million expenditures on exploration activities or delivering a positive feasibility study on the project, at which time the ownership will be 79% Ganfeng Lithium and 21% ILC. <br/>With the increasing demand for high tech rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles and electrical storage as well as portable electronics, lithium has been designated \"the new oil\", and is a key part of a \"green tech\" sustainable economy. By positioning itself with solid strategic partners and projects with significant resource potential, ILC aims to be one of the lithium and rare metals resource developers of choice for investors and to continue to build value for its shareholders in the '20s, the decade of battery metals. <br/>On behalf of the Company, <br/>John Wisbey Chairman and CEO <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.internationallithium.com\">www.internationallithium.com</url>[1] <br/>For further information concerning this news release please contact +1 604-449-6520 <br/>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. <br/>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information <br/>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release or other releases contain certain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities law.

After two weeks, the vessels and helicopter will head out to sea where they will be ready to respond to a domestic emergency as needed.</p><p>\"This option gives us the best chance of avoiding a community spread within one of the ships should someone have contracted the virus at the last minute due to natural family interactions,\" he said in his letter.</p><p>\"I recognize this decision will be very challenging for our sailors and their families. In many ways, it will be like they have left on deployment, while in reality they will be very close by.\"</p><p>The U.S. Navy has seen COVID-19 infections on two of its nuclear-powered aircraft carriers over the past week, where close quarters have allowed the illness to spread like wildfire among the crew.</p><p>Baines could not say how long the Ville de Quebec and Moncton would remain at sea, suggesting it would largely depend on the pandemic.</p><p>The sequestration order came as the federal government promised the military is ready to respond should a formal request for assistance come from a province, territory or municipality, whether it is to help with COVID-19 or a natural disaster such as a flood.</p><p>\"To date, the federal government has received no requests for action from the provinces or territories,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in French during the daily news conference outside his Ottawa home on Monday.</p><p>\"If that were to change, the Armed Forces would be ready to answer the call as they have done throughout our history, whether it is to transport medical equipment or protect your homes during the flood or forest-fire season. Those who wear the uniform will be there for you.\"</p><p>Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan later revealed Ottawa is ready to mobilize up to 24,000 Canadian troops to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. That represents about a quarter of the entire force and would be one of the largest peacetime mobilizations in Canadian history.</p><p>Those on standby include 10 Canadian Army units as well as Navy ships and Air Force aircraft and crew. Reservists and Canadian Rangers are also being put on notice, Sajjan said, with the Rangers ready to conduct patrols to northern and Indigenous communities.</p><p>\"These flexible teams are capable of operating as local response forces to assist with humanitarian support, wellness checks, natural disaster response and other tasks as required,\" said Sajjan, adding requests for assistance will be prioritized based on need.</p><p>The minister added that the government has been in touch with some remote communities to assess their needs. The military has in recent years provided assistance, including evacuations due to flooding and forest fires, to Indigenous communities and others in the north.</p><p>Sajjan also left the door open to military personnel helping enforce quarantines while chief of the defence staff Gen.

Vayu builds high-performance vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) hybrid propulsion-based, autonomous aircraft. Its customers and partners range from public and private entities in Australia, Canada and sub-Saharan Africa in a variety of sectors - from critical medical supply transport to infrastructure inspection. Vayu represents Alpine 4's second recent acquisition in the fast-growing UAV space and will serve as a vital addition to the platform capabilities of Impossible Aerospace. The shareholders of Vayu are primarily leading venture capitalists and angel investors, including Tesla Motors founder's Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and Cosmonaut Esther Dyson, as well as public health experts. Like Impossible Aerospace, the transaction will be completed in a reverse triangular merger with a newly formed subsidiary of Alpine 4. Upon meeting the final closing conditions, Vayu will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpine 4. Vayu and Alpine 4 expect to have the closing conditions met by January 10th, 2021. Daniel Pepper, the current CEO of Vayu, will continue on in his role as CEO.</p><p/><p>Strategic Rationale</p><p>Kent Wilson, CEO of Alpine 4, had this to say, \"I cannot say enough about Vayu and why I absolutely love this company. Their mission is resolute and purposeful. Their X5, G1 and G2 aircraft are designed to deliver lifesaving medicine and technology to people within inaccessible areas of developing countries, as well as hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities in the U.S. The mission-driven purpose of it alone is even more significant than its dollar value. When you look at the evolving landscape of the commercial UAV industry, you see an abundance of opportunities for Vayu's family of VTOL aircraft. Its seven years of expertise combines not only core technologies advantages but also invaluable market insights.</p><p>Wilson added: \"Vayu's platforms complement the multicopters from Impossible Aerospace. Both Vayu and Impossible Aerospace have unique qualities that make their respective platforms advantageous and complementary, depending on the requirements of the end-user. Combining these two companies into the Alpine 4 portfolio of subsidiaries gives us a wider and larger scope of commercial clients and positions the company to capture a large market share of the commercial drone industry.\"</p><p>Daniel Pepper, CEO of Vayu, said, \"This represents the beginning of a new chapter in Vayu's story. The company began in response to an acute need of tremendous magnitude: solving some of the hardest logistical challenges for delivering medical care, anywhere in the world. Over the years Vayu's capabilities have grown in size and capability, and in direct response to an enormous amount of customer and stakeholder engagement. Platforms such as the G1 and the G2 are virtually unmatched in the civilian market, yet their demand is as critical as ever. Whether it is for maritime surveillance, forest fire monitoring, linear asset inspection, or the primary and core use case of medical delivery, Vayu's opportunity set is wide, diverse, and growing. In the years to come, Vayu will further expand its offerings to a range of customers, ever expanding its payload and range capabilities, while further investing in its autopilot and avionics expertise to further safety, reliability, and autonomy.\"</p><p>Transaction highlights include: //st * Advanced UAV autopilot software: The acquisition of Vayu will allow Alpine 4 to incorporate Vayu's highly advanced and rugged autopilot company-wide for other applications such as with Impossible Aerospace's US-1 drone. * Large Medical Market Opportunities: The rural medical markets of 'last mile' and 'middle mile' delivery that can be supported by Vayu's drone technology are large and growing. Vayu's G1 has a payload of 12lb while its G2 aircraft has a payload capacity of up to 44lbs. * Vertical Manufacturing: Having Vayu within the portfolio of Alpine 4 companies will add more integration opportunities with our subsidiary Quality Circuit Assembly and have cross-pollination manufacturing opportunities for the team at Vayu.</p><p>Vayu builds high-performance gas/electric VTOL aircraft that save lives.

The research highlights how the presence of pollutants, such as particulate matter and aerosols, in the atmosphere can enhance storm activity. This leads to increased rainfall and potentially more severe weather events, amplifying risks for the region\u2019s ecosystems and communities.    As Southeast Asia grapples with the twin challenges of storm intensification and forest fire air pollution , the study emphasizes the urgent need for addressing these intertwined environmental issues. The impact of increased pollutant particles in the atmosphere, especially during the monsoon season, could exacerbate flooding risks, disrupt local communities, and put significant strain on disaster management resources.     How Forest Fire Air Pollution Alters Storms and Weather Patterns    The study reveals that forest fire air pollution plays a crucial role in altering atmospheric conditions, making storms in Southeast Asia more potent. The release of pollutant particles during forest fires can modify cloud formation, intensifying rainfall and strengthening storm systems. This intensification of storms could have severe implications for the region, particularly during the already heavy monsoon season , when the risks of flooding and infrastructure damage are higher.    The presence of particulate matter and aerosols in the air further contributes to the shifting dynamics of storms in the region. The increased storm severity and frequency, driven by forest fire air pollution , complicates local preparedness efforts and places additional pressure on emergency response systems, already stretched thin by the ongoing effects of climate change.    Exacerbating Flooding Risks and Impact on Communities    The intensification of storms due to forest fire air pollution is raising concerns about the increased risk of flooding in Southeast Asia. The combination of heavy rainfall and more powerful storms during the monsoon season poses a significant threat to local communities, especially in flood-prone areas such as river deltas and coastal regions. These areas, already vulnerable to flooding, face even greater risks as the intensity of storms increases.    The consequences of these intensified storms extend beyond physical damage to homes and infrastructure. Communities are also facing long-term economic losses, food insecurity, and potential public health challenges. The flooding could displace thousands, disrupt local economies, and overwhelm disaster management resources, making it essential to address the underlying environmental causes of storm intensification .    Addressing the Root Causes of Forest Fires and Air Pollution    Experts stress that addressing the root causes of forest fires, particularly unsustainable agricultural practices and land-use changes, is key to reducing the impact of forest fire air pollution . The study emphasizes that slash-and-burn agriculture and deforestation, both of which contribute significantly to air pollution in Southeast Asia, must be curtailed to mitigate the worsening storm conditions.    By implementing stricter regulations on land management and promoting more sustainable farming practices, Southeast Asia can reduce the frequency and severity of forest fires, thereby decreasing their contribution to storm intensification . A focus on reforestation, soil conservation, and the reduction of land-use changes will play an important role in controlling the pollutant particles released during forest fires and reducing the associated environmental risks.    A Regional Approach to Mitigate the Impact of Storm Intensification    The findings from this study underscore the need for Southeast Asian nations to take a regional, coordinated approach to address the challenges posed by forest fire air pollution and storm intensification . Governments, businesses, and local communities must work together to implement strategies that both mitigate pollution and improve disaster preparedness. This includes strengthening disaster management systems, investing in green infrastructure, and enforcing stricter environmental regulations to control emissions from forest fires.    In addition, raising public awareness about the connections between forest fire air pollution , climate change, and storm dynamics is crucial in fostering collective responsibility. Local governments and environmental organizations should promote sustainable land-use practices, educate farmers on the dangers of slash-and-burn agriculture, and encourage citizens to reduce their carbon footprint to help combat storm intensification .    Strengthening Southeast Asia\u2019s Climate Resilience for the Future    In order to mitigate the long-term effects of forest fire air pollution and storm intensification , Southeast Asia needs to adopt comprehensive climate resilience strategies. These strategies must focus on sustainable land management, improved infrastructure, and enhanced emergency response capabilities. Climate change adaptation should be at the forefront of policy discussions, as increasing storm intensity linked to air pollution will likely become a more prominent issue in the years to come.    Building climate resilience not only involves reducing the risks of storm intensification but also includes proactive measures such as flood control systems, improved drainage, and investments in green spaces. Additionally, fostering collaboration between countries in Southeast Asia will be essential for sharing resources, knowledge, and best practices to combat the growing environmental crisis.    A Holistic Approach to Address Environmental and Climate Challenges    The study\u2019s findings serve as a stark reminder of the interrelated nature of environmental issues in Southeast Asia. As forest fire air pollution and storm intensification continue to threaten the region, governments, communities, and organizations must collaborate on integrated solutions. From enforcing stricter land-use regulations to improving storm preparedness, the path forward will require a multifaceted approach to protect the region\u2019s communities and ecosystems from the devastating effects of climate change.    The research underscores the need for proactive, region-wide strategies to combat the environmental factors driving forest fire air pollution and storm intensification . Only through coordinated action and sustainable practices can Southeast Asia hope to mitigate the risks posed by these growing environmental challenges and secure a more resilient future for its people.

(the \"Company\" or \"ILC\") is pleased to announce that it has closed the first tranche of its non-brokered private placement (the \"Private Placement\") of units (\"Unit\") announced on July 15, 2021. On closing, the Company issued 8,966,667 Units at CAD $0.06 per Unit for proceeds of CAD $538,000. Each Unit is comprised of one common share and one-half of one share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one additional common share at an exercise price of CAD $0.08 per common share until June 30, 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proceeds of the Private Placement will be used for exploration on the Company's Raleigh Lake Project and for general corporate and administrative costs. All Private Placement securities will be restricted from trading for a period of four months plus one day from the date of closing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No finder's fees were paid on this tranche of the transaction.</p><p>John Wisbey, Chairman and CEO of the Company, commented, \"This placing continues the successful fundraising conducted earlier this year, and allows us to continue work on our lithium and rubidium deposit at Raleigh Lake soon after the current forest fire prevention restrictions in that part of Ontario are lifted.\"</p><p>Certain directors and officers participated in this tranche of the Private Placement. The issuance of private placement securities to non-arms' length parties constitutes related-party transactions under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). Because the Company's shares trade only on the TSX Venture Exchange, the issuance of securities is exempt from the formal valuation requirements of Section 5.4 of MI 61-101 pursuant to Subsection 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 and exempt from the minority approval requirements of Section 5.6 of MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.7(b). The Company did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the closing of the private placement as the details of the participation of insiders of the Company had not been confirmed at that time.</p><p>About International Lithium Corp.</p><p>International Lithium Corp. believes that the '20s will be the decade of battery metals, at a time that the world faces a significant turning point in the energy market's dependence on oil and gas and in the governmental and public view of climate change. Our key mission in the new decade is to make money for our shareholders from lithium and battery metals while at the same time helping to create a greener, cleaner planet. This includes optimizing the value of our existing projects in Canada, Argentina and Ireland as well as finding, exploring and developing projects that have the potential to become world class lithium and rare metal deposits. In addition, we have seen the clear and growing wish by the USA and Canada to safeguard their supplies of critical battery metals, and our Canadian properties are strategic in that respect.</p><p>A key goal is to become a well funded company to turn our aspirations into reality.</p><p>International Lithium Corp. has a significant portfolio of projects, strong management, and strong partners. Partners include Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd., (\"Ganfeng Lithium\") a leading China-based lithium product manufacturer quoted on the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges (A share code: 002460, H share code: 1772) and Essential Metals Limited, quoted on the Australian Stock exchange.</p><p>The Company's primary strategic focus is now on the Raleigh Lake lithium and rubidium project in Canada and on the Company's strategic options on the Mariana project in Argentina. In respect of the latter, the Company has announced that its board believes it to be in the best interests of the Company to sell its stake in Mariana before the next capital intensive stage of the project gets underway.</p><p>The Raleigh Lake project consists of 3,027 hectares of adjoining mineral claims in Ontario, and is regarded by ILC management as ILC's most significant project in Canada. The pegmatites explored there contain significant quantities of rubidium and caesium as well as lithium. Raleigh Lake is 100% owned by ILC, is not subject to any encumbrances, and is royalty free.</p><p>Current ownership of the Mariana lithium-potash brine project is through a joint venture company, Litio Minera Argentina S. A. (\"LMA\"), a private company registered in Argentina. At December 31, 2020, LMA was owned 88.4% by Ganfeng Lithium and 11.6% by ILC (percentages are subject to audit). As at mid 2021 and subject to further audit, the Company's share had been diluted to around 10%. In addition, ILC currently has an option to acquire a further 10% in LMA through a back-in right. The Mariana project is located within the renowned South American \"Lithium Belt\" that is the host to the vast majority of global lithium resources, reserves and production. The Mariana project strategically encompasses an entire mineral rich evaporite basin, totalling 160 square kilometres, and has over 7,800,000 tonnes of Measured and Indicated Lithium Chloride equivalent resource, ranking it as one of the more prospective salars or 'salt lakes' in the region.</p><p>Complementing the Company's lithium brine project at Mariana and rare metal pegmatite property at Raleigh Lake, are interests in two other rare metal pegmatite properties in Ontario, Canada known as the Mavis Lake and Forgan Lake projects, and the Avalonia project in Ireland, which encompasses an extensive 50-km-long pegmatite belt.</p><p>The ownership of the Mavis Lake project is now 51% Essential Metals Limited (\"ESS\") and 49% ILC. In addition, ILC owns a 1.5% NSR on Mavis Lake. ESS has an option to earn an additional 29% by sole-funding a further CAD $8.5 million expenditures of exploration activities, at which time the ownership will be 80% ESS and 20% ILC.</p><p>The Forgan Lake project will, upon Ultra Resources Inc. meeting its contractual requirements pursuant to its agreement with ILC, become 100% owned by Ultra Resources, and ILC will retain a 1.5% NSR on Forgan Lake.</p><p>The ownership of the Avalonia project is currently 55% Ganfeng Lithium and 45% ILC. Ganfeng Lithium has an option to earn an additional 24% by either incurring CAD $10 million expenditures on exploration activities or delivering a positive feasibility study on the project, at which time the ownership will be 79% Ganfeng Lithium and 21% ILC.</p><p>With the increasing demand for high tech rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles and electrical storage as well as portable electronics, lithium has been designated \"the new oil\", and is a key part of a \"green tech\" sustainable economy. By positioning itself with solid strategic partners and projects with significant resource potential, ILC aims to be one of the lithium and rare metals resource developers of choice for investors and to continue to build value for its shareholders in the '20s, the decade of battery metals.</p><p>On behalf of the Company,</p><p>John Wisbey</p><p>Chairman and CEO</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.internationallithium.com\">www.internationallithium.com</url></p><p>For further information concerning this news release please contact +1 604-449-6520</p><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release or other releases contain certain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities law.

They are in an impossible situation, and quite frankly I'm done with it, and so should most of the visitors to the park who go there to enjoy their day, not to have their child witness a cliff accident or drunk belligerent people.\"</p><p>Firefighters and B.C. Ambulance paramedics were called on Saturday afternoon (Aug. 1) after a teenager was found unconscious on a trail behind the lake. Crews determined the 15-year-old was severely intoxicated.</p><p>The second incident happened as crews were returning to the station. They were immediately called back to the lake after a brush fire was reported on the big island. Fire crews deployed forestry equipment and their marine unit to access the fire, caused by a campfire. According to Hurst, the person who lit the fire swam away before crews arrived.</p><p>\"These two incidents not only tied up emergency resources in View Royal for several hours but also those of Colwood and Langford Fire, who were tasked with looking after the Town of View Royal while we were deployed. Both of these incidents are 100 per cent preventable and result in the unnecessary deployment of significant resources to manage. On top of this, first responder crews were subject to harassment on this call and in the execution of their duties,\" Hurst said.</p><p>ALSO READ: View Royal fire chief frustrated by Thetis Lake accidents</p><p>He noted firefighters also voiced concern about the \"absolute disregard\" for physical distancing on the beach and trails. He added the main beach resembled pictures of overcrowded beaches from spring break in the U.S.</p><p>\"My firefighters have to not only manage the incident but wade through groups of people who have zero regard for their own well-being or that of emergency services personnel.\"</p><p>Asked if View Royal Fire Rescue has seen an uptick in calls or if this is typical for the summer season, Hurst said looking back at the '80s and '90s, the department (in consultation and agreement with the City of Victoria, previous owners) would close the back of the park because of high or extreme fire ratings. This led to no visitors off the main beach, which resulted in few or no rescue, fire or alcohol-related calls. But as he noted, this isn't the case now and hasn't been practised for several years.</p><p>Hurst is eager to sit down with Capital Regional District officials to discuss what he called realistic solutions to the park and its problems while creating a long-term plan.</p><p>\"All options are on the table from my perspective, as the costs are excessive and the risks far outweigh the benefit of doing nothing and simply responding to pick up the pieces of irresponsible decisions.\"</p><p>Hurst added bylaw officers have been working hard in the park to educate and mitigate issues.</p><p>\"They spoke to people on the beach about physical distancing; they spoke to people on the cliffs about the dangers associated &amp;#x26;#8230; and I will bet you know where they were told to go.\"</p><p>CRD bylaw officers work with the RCMP, municipal police and fire detachments to reduce alcohol and drug use, smoking and other risky behaviours in the park, noted a spokesperson for the CRD. In 2018, the CRD board approved a $100,000 budget for additional enforcement relating to dog management and park regulations. A portion of that allows for more time to be spent educating visitors about swimming and cliff-jumping hazards, especially at Thetis Lake.</p><p>The CRD noted visitation to its parks and trails increases every year and peaks during the summer months, especially at popular destinations such as Thetis Lake, with the majority of visitors respectful of others and natural areas.</p><p>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CRD is reminding visitors to do their part on beaches and in parks. This includes staying home if ill; keeping two metres apart from other visitors on the beaches, trails or in the water; yielding to others while walking single file; and parking in designated spots to ensure emergency vehicle access. The CRD is also asking residents to consider using other areas in parks if visitors are unable to properly practice physical distancing or returning at another time if the parking lot is full.</p><p>ALSO READ: Years of 'horrific, violent accidents' at Thetis Lake prompt plea to public</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Do you have a story tip?

Snowpacks in snow courses of both basins were at a minimum or all-time lows at the end of the month. On the Kootenay River, snowpacks are well below average in both the east and west drainages.</p><p>Dateline March 19, 1970</p><p>Nelson has a problem. Expected growth in the recreation and tourist industries, along with the federal incentives plan to attract industry, could result in great expansion for the city, but where do the people go? At least a partial solution was presented at city council Monday in the form of a proposed land assembly scheme for the Rosemont area.</p><p>The report says that the Rosemont area is the only one left in the city which could offer good land for house construction. The portion of land termed most attractive for land assembly is the wooded area in Rosemont once intended as the site for Columbia College.</p><p>The Fairview area is completely built up, except for the university area, which must be kept clear for possible expansion; the View Street area would be very difficult to develop because of existing construction and the expensive costs of fitting in new utilities to meld into the existing neighborhood; the remaining fringe in the Uphill section is a stretched-out remnant abutting a railway track and possibilities for attractive development appear remote.</p><p>The plan says financing of the scheme in its initial stages could be assumed by the city, with ultimate costs then being taken over by a private developer, who would gain his profit by the sale of the lots.</p><p>Dateline March 20, 1970</p><p>The completion of a $3.3 million project to bring direct long distance dialing service to West Kootenay communities including Nelson will highlight the B.C. Telephone Company's $1.7 million expansion program for West Kootenay during 1970. Facilities to enable Nelson and other B.C. Tel customers in the region to dial long distance calls directly are to go into service in June.</p><p>At that time, the Nelson telephone office will become the primary toll centre for the entire district, providing operator services and the switching and ticketing machinery through which direct dialing works. Other expansion of facilities in Nelson this year involves about $40,000 in cable placement throughout the exchange area to provide for connection of additional customers and improved service to others.</p><p>Dateline March 23, 1970</p><p>The 1969-70 Western International Hockey League season for the Nelson Maple Leafs ended Friday night. The Leafs, down three games in the best-of-seven league final with the Spokane Jets, were edged 2-1 at Civic Arena.</p><p>The Jets, in winning the series four straight, copped the Savage Cup and WIHL Round Table Award for the third straight year as they continued their domination of the league. The Jets will now meet the winner of the Alberta Hockey League playoff in the quarter-finals of the Allan Cup.</p><p>However, the Leafs did not go down without a fight. Only two quick goals from the Jets in the final period destroyed the Leafs' hopes of further playoff competition. Playing before 2,400 partisan Nelson Leaf fans at Civic Arena, the locals turned on their best performance of the series and were ahead on the scoreboard after two periods of play, 1-0.</p><p>Bill McDonnell in the Nelson net, playing his first game of the final playoffs, was the reason the Leafs were ahead and not behind as he came up with 17 saves, many of them from close in. McDonnell produced some dazzling stops, sometimes sprawling flat out to pounce on a loose puck or doing the splits on another occasion.</p><p>Disaster struck in the final frame for the Leafs, as they let down after a Spokane power play marker and then were stunned seven seconds later by a second goal. With McDonnell's brilliance in goal, coupled with a 100 per cent effort from the rest of the team, the Leafs came close to defeating the Jets and another crack at the Savage Cup.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-3975670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHN-6W01-JDH1-C296-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nelson Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 26, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0005LSH</classCode><className>BC TEL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SIC4813 TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, EXCEPT RADIOTELEPHONE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001589</classCode><className>WINTER SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DEFE</classCode><className>INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001454</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001817</classCode><className>WATER QUALITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001454</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N517000CC</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0008ZHZ</classCode><className>TELEPHONE SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001046</classCode><className>LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(Damara or the Company) is pleased to announce the Company has entered into a joint venture agreement with Universal Copper Ltd (\"Universal\") in respect of the Placer Mountain project (Placer Mountain or the Property) located in British Columbia. As noted in the Damara press release datedApril 30, 2021, Damara has completed its earn-in expenditures and exercised the option to acquire a 75% interest in Placer Mountain. Universal retains the remaining 25% interest.</p><p>Larry Nagy, President and CEO of Damara stated We are pleased to have finalized thePlacer Mountainjoint venture agreement with Universal and are extremely excited to commence exploration on the Placer Mountain Project. Despite last minute timing issues and limited drill site access when the Company first acquired the Project last December, the maiden 2020 drill program successfully demonstrated the presence of a significant gold-bearing vein system on the Project. The well-exposed Main Vein trends directly under post-mineral cover, which combined with the presence of widespread quartz-limonite float, indicate good potential for the discovery of buried and preserved mineralization elsewhere on the Project. We are also very excited to test the copper-gold porphyry target revealed by our teams data compilation effort. The Company looks forward to updating the market with the Phase II results from our upcoming drill program planned for this late Summer/Early Fall.</p><p>The Phase II exploration program includes a plan to collect approximately 2,500 B-horizon soil samples as well as complete a Soil Gas Hydrocarbon (SGH) orientation survey over and along strike of the Main Vein, where it trends underneath Eocene age post-mineral Princeton Group cover rocks.</p><p>Phase II will also consist of detail geological mapping, prospecting, and stream sediment sampling. With excellent weather conditions forecasted in Princeton, crews are expected to be able to continue exploration work without interruption. Numerous forest service roads provide excellent access throughout the Project. A recent forest fire and extensive logging in the area has exposed several new highly prospective areas showing widespread quartz-limonite vein float that were previously covered by heavy vegetation during historic exploration programs.</p><p>The quartz-limonite vein float occurs along a well-defined corridor identified by previous operators (Henneberry, 2018)1, which trends north from the main vein with a particularly strong concentration recently identified at the base of a Princeton Group exposure over 3.5 kilometers to the north of the Main Vein.</p><p>Damara will be focusing its exploration along an unconformity in the north of the Project, which separates Eocene Princeton Group and Triassic Nicola Group rocks (Figure 1), Northern Au-Ag Target). Select historic grab samples running up to 28.9 g/t Au and 100 g/t Ag have been collected <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/\">https://www.thenewswire.com/data/tnw/clients/img/</url></p><p>Click Image To View Full Sizein the area2,3. The Princeton volcanics may have provided a protective cap, preventing erosion of underlying mineralization throughout the Project. Mineralization may be better preserved under Princeton Group cover than where exposed at surface at the Main Vein showing.</p><p>A comprehensive stream sediment sampling program (Figure 2) to test for the presence of elevated gold, arsenic and antimony may help locate additional zones of buried mineralization elsewhere on the Project.</p><p>An interesting copper-molybdenum-gold-silver-arsenic-antimony anomaly in the western portion of the property was detected in road side soil samples collected by historic operators, along trend and only ~13km from the producing Copper Mountain Cu-Au Mine. The soil anomaly occurs along a prominent north-south gravity lineament defined by a regional airborne survey flown by Geoscience BC (Figure 3). The lineament is coincident with the Summers Creek Fault Zone, a north-south belt of alkalic copper-gold porphyry showings which trend from Copper Mountain in the south through to Kodiak Coppers recent MPD discovery. The Summers Creek Fault Zone represents a deep-seated regional structure, that controlled the emplacement of copper-gold porphyry mineralization along the belt. The gravity lineament, and the inferred Summers Creek Fault Zone, pass directly through the western half of the Placer Mountain Property, representing a potential copper-gold porphyry target. The soil anomaly is coincident with a magnetic high anomaly, which is a key characteristic of alkalic porphyry systems which often have a high magnetite content. A 1,000 soil sample grid is planned over this porphyry target area.</p><p>Following receipt and interpretation of the Phase II exploration results, the Company aims to follow up with excavator trenching across selected new targets as well as a minimum 2,000-meter core drilling program as early as September of this year. The permits for this proposed work program are currently in place.</p><p>About Placer Mountain</p><p>The Placer Mountain Property is comprised of 22 mineral claims covering approximately 8,955 hectares located approximately 35km south of Princeton, British Columbia and is subject to the Universal and Wilson NSR.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. Gerald G.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of June 11, 2022 20 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Ceremonial Drive, between Chagall Court and Bristol Road West in Ward 5.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of June 13, 2022 21 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Ceremonial Drive, between Chagall Court and Bristol Road West in Ward 5.

In the Russian community of Verkhoyansk, temperatures topped 38C, <url normalizedValue=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/june-sees-more-global-heat-especially-arctic-siberia\">marking what may be the highest air temperature ever recorded within the Arctic</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The temperatures at Verkhoyansk are part of a larger trend across western Russia this summer, with small communities throughout the region reporting temperatures that are <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mikarantane/status/1280900094913585152?s=20\">smashing local records</url> that have stood for decades. During the latter half of June, surface temperatures throughout western Siberia were as much as <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/arctic-siberias-unusual-warm-spell-continues\">10C above historical</url> norms, marking one of the hottest Junes on record despite relatively cool temperatures at the start of the month. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For scientists the world-over these record-breaking temperatures are alarm bells, demonstrating the kind of extreme weather events we can <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/100-degrees-in-siberia-5-ways-the-extreme-arctic-heat-wave-follows-a-disturbing-pattern-141442\">expect to see more often</url> if climate change continues unchecked. However, it is the long-term fallout from modern heat waves that has many northern scientists deeply concerned, as they will affect our planet for decades to come.</p><h>The fires that follow</h><p>During heat waves surface temperatures soar, often triggering a chain of fire-promoting weather conditions including extreme thunderstorms. These thunderstorms have hundreds of <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate3329\">lightning strikes that can ignite the dry soils</url> and vegetation that serve as fuel for fire. </p><p>In northern regions like the boreal biome, these fire-promoting conditions can cause large-scale wildfires that burn <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14287\">millions of hectares of forest</url> in a single summer. </p><p>Historically, humanity has considered wildfire a true disaster and spent considerable resources to suppress them. We now understand that despite the initial loss of established trees and soils, wildfires are a natural and integral part of the boreal biome. </p><p>Modern wildfires, however, are occurring with increasing frequency and intensity, covering a larger area due weather events like severe heat waves. In extreme fire years, these <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1071/WF17095\">modern wildfires can burn deep into the organic soils</url> that characterize boreal forests. These carbon-rich soils have been built up over thousands of years and hold approximately <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.4155/cmt.13.77\">30 per cent of the world's terrestrial carbon stocks</url>. </p><p>When fires burn deep into soils or return too quickly to a forest, they lose their <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1474-y\">\"ancient carbon\" stocks</url>. Instead of being held in the ground these ancient carbon reserves are combusted and released back into the atmosphere, increasing the carbon levels. The higher carbon dioxide levels generated by wildfires intensify climate change impacts like heat waves, which can lead to further wildfires, forming a powerful \"positive feedback\" loop with climate change. </p><p>While these trends alone are alarming, northern researchers warn that the fallout from heat waves won't stop when the fires burn out. In northern regions where the soils historically stay frozen year-round, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05457-1\">whole new set of changes</url> are beginning to take form. </p><h>When permafrost perishes</h><p>Permafrost forms on the landscape when soil materials remain below freezing for two or more consecutive years. In some areas permafrost forms in direct response to a cold climate. </p><p>As one moves further south, however, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1139/X10-060\">permafrost becomes increasingly dependent on the presence of thick organic soils</url>, surface vegetation and a shady overstorey to survive the warm summer months. In those cases, the ecosystem acts like a giant protective blanket, limiting the sun's heat that is able to reach the frozen permafrost materials below.</p><p>When permafrost ecosystems burn, the wildfire consumes these protective layers, often triggering permafrost thaw. <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0526-0\">This can occur gradually, with the thawed layer expanding slowly over decades, or abruptly</url>, with the thawed layer expanding dramatically over years. The land may cave in or sink, plant communities may change completely and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/landslide-creates-new-lake-in-yukon-s-kluane-national-park-1.2890258\">local water flows may be rerouted.</url></p><p>In both cases, the loss of permafrost makes the massive Arctic carbon reserves more vulnerable to loss. With gradual thaw microbes are able to break down and release the previously frozen carbon back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In contrast, abrupt thaw commonly occurs in ice-rich permafrost resulting in warmer but also wetter soils. Under these conditions decomposition still occurs but carbon is commonly returned to the atmosphere as methane, a greenhouse gas approximately <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf\">30 times more powerful</url> at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. </p><p>All this lost carbon may make the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14338\">positive feedback with climate change</url> even stronger. While scientists are working to understand if the vegetation that grows after permafrost thaw is able to offset all the carbon released during decomposition, most current models indicate that permafrost thaw will <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1719903115\">ultimately be a source of atmospheric carbon</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: More frequent fires could dramatically alter boreal forests and emit more carbon</emphasis></p><p>Researchers are coming to understand just how tightly linked these disturbances caused by climate change really are.

A close contact of hers who was also on the tour is being tested and \"may well\" test positive, Henry said.</p><p>Ontario and Quebec have a number of cases related to tours in Egypt and B.C. is working with its federal counterparts to determine whether the infections are related, she added.</p><p>Another travel-related case is a man in his 40s who recently returned from Germany while the other is a man in his 90s who was aboard the Grand Princess cruise that returned on Feb. 21. All three are in the Vancouver area.</p><p>The two new community cases are both in the region covered by Fraser Health and involve a man in his 90s who is in hospital and a man in his 40s who is in isolation at home.</p><p>Health Minister Adrian Dix said B.C.'s cases include 16 linked to travel to Iran, one to Hong Kong and India, one to Washington state, three to the Grand Princess cruise, one to Italy and one to Germany.</p><p>Testing has increased dramatically this week and there are now five sites around the province where testing can be done, Dix said.</p><p>\"We continue to do the most testing of any jurisdiction in the country. I think that's significant.

Our seniors are the tinder and part-time, poorly paid staff are the spark. Personal care for the elderly, disabled, and children is still largely \"women's work.\" Pay is so low for personal support workers that there was a serious shortage before COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But all organizations need adequately paid and trained staff to accomplish their mission. Like having non-slip flooring, treating employees with care so they can better care for others should be LTC care admin 101. It hardly outlines a new model of care. LTC should provide social and physical environments where the frail elderly can thrive. And these settings also protect vulnerable Canadians from communicable diseases.</p><p>Another prerequisite is non-profit personal care. Yes, the private sector should provide the wheelchairs, food, and cleaning materials. And, the non-profit sector is not a pristine alternative. But we want to minimize the incentives for underservicing. The evidence shows overall poorer quality care in for-profit facilities related to lower staff ratios. Our public resources for personal care should go to workers, not investors.</p><p>There are two major strategies for LTC reform. The first is a different LTC institution. The second is to move LTC to the community.</p><p>Some older LTC institutions need to be completely overhauled. Many residents still live two or four to a room in 30 to 40 bed wards. Every person must have their own room and their own toilet, for their dignity and safety.</p><p>And, we don't want facilities that feel like warehouses with a dozen different staff in a resident's room every day. Some new homes have 500 residents. With contingent workers working on several wards in several institutions every month, it's not whether, it's when, there will be a major outbreak.</p><p>In contrast, in homes embracing the American Eden Alternative or the British Butterfly model, residents typically have their own rooms and live in 8 to 10 room houses.</p><p>At Saskatoon's Sherbrooke Community Centre's \"The Village,\" nine or 10 residents live in their own rooms in their own houses. Each house opens onto an indoor streetscape, \"Poppy Lane\" with a hairdresser, gift shop, market, art studio and other amenities.</p><p>The previously separate housekeeping, dietary, and personal care staff have been cross-trained so a small number can provide all the house's care. In case of an outbreak, each resident can be isolated and individual houses can be isolated from others.</p><p>The reduced risk of infection is a side benefit of Sherbrooke's implementation of the Eden Alternative. The small numbers of staff and residents enhance human relationships, vitalizing residents and caregivers.</p><p>The other model of LTC is intensive community care. In the 1980s, San Francisco's On Lok Seniors Services pioneered the Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly. PACE is now found in over 150 American communities. Participants are eligible if they are assessed as needing LTC by a state assessor. They can choose either institutional care or PACE.</p><p>Program participants live in their own housing. Many live in supportive housing and some live with family. PACE provides all needed health services at home 24/7. A lot of services (e.g. diagnostic, rehab, bathing, as well as socialization) are provided in congregate day facilities that operate 10 to12 hours a day. The day centres have subacute beds so families can get respite and participants can get IV treatments and other care without hospitalization.</p><p>It works. On Lok's clients are as healthy and happy as they can be. PACE participants have lower health care costs, longer life expectancy, improved quality of life, and reduced use of acute and long-term care.</p><p>PACE provides much better communicable disease protection than traditional LTC because each resident has their own home, which can be easily locked down during pandemics.</p><p>Provinces are planning to spend tens of billions of dollars building new LTC facilities in the next decade. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted that we need new ways of providing LTC to protect residents from plagues of communicable disease. But we also need to eradicate the noncommunicable plagues of old age identified by the architects of the Eden Alternative - loneliness, helplessness, and boredom.</p><p>We need new models of care that prioritize human relationships, dignity, and safety. That means a moratorium on new LTC facilities that don't look like Sherbrooke Community Centre's Poppy Lane. And let's save billions of dollars in bricks and mortar with a Canadian version PACE.</p><p>Dr. Michael Rachlis is a public health physician and an Adjunct Professor at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020050857902758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YVM-0FR1-F103-34SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The innovative project features technology being used for the first time in North America and represents exciting new opportunities to reduce emissions using British Columbia (BC)'s expansive forestry sector. The production facility will be owned and operated by REN Energy and located near Fruitvale, BC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are extremely pleased with our FortisBC agreement spanning 20 years, to provide RNG to our fellow BC customers,\" said Philip Viggiani, president of REN Energy. \"REN Energy plans to be a major factor in assisting with the FortisBC mandate of creating carbon-neutral RNG. The REN team has been working for the past several years to create the REN Solution that creates RNG from wood waste. The plant, the first of its kind in North America, will create an immediate annual economic impact in the Kootenay region, as well our future waste-to-energy project regions will carry similar economic impacts in regard to the creation of hundreds of direct and indirect jobs, significant in-community investments and, of course, the clean energy product we create.\"</p><p>Renewable Natural Gas is a carbon-neutral energy that is typically made from capturing the methane released from decomposing organic waste. This project will make use of waste from forestry operations, sawmills and other wood product manufacturers and, rather than collecting the methane from decomposition, would create syngas through gasification. The syngas is further converted to methane and then purified to meet natural gas line specifications. Once operational, the technology will create a use for forestry waste in BC and unlock the potential for significant new volumes of RNG in BC. This will also assist the forestry industry with cleaning up bush residuals, thereby assisting in provincial forest fire mitigation.</p><p>\"This is such an exciting win for us. This and future projects like it will rely on waste already generated by sustainable forestry, making it a credible addition to energy production in this province,\" said Doug Stout, vice-president of market development and external relations at FortisBC. \"I'd like to thank REN Energy and the community of Fruitvale for their partnership as we continue to work hard to reduce emissions and advance towards a lower carbon future.\"</p><p>Advancing carbon-neutral energies such as RNG is a crucial element of FortisBC's 30BY30 target   the organization's goal to reduce customers' greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. FortisBC is also working towards having 15 per cent of its natural gas supply be renewable by 2030, which is in line with commitments outlined in the Province's CleanBC promise.</p><p>The project received regulatory approval from the British Columbia Utilities Commission last month and is expected to be in service in the summer of 2021. It is anticipated to produce over one million gigajoules of RNG annually, which would make it the largest source of RNG in the province to date. RNG blends seamlessly with conventional natural gas in FortisBC's existing infrastructure which includes approximately 49,000 kilometres of natural gas lines, safely delivering energy throughout the province. </p><p>For more information on how FortisBC is supporting the growth of renewable gases as part of its 30BY30 target, visit: fortisbc.com/30BY30.</p><p>About FortisBC Energy Inc.FortisBC Energy Inc. is a regulated utility focused on providing safe and reliable energy, including natural gas, propane and thermal energy solutions.

We never expected to have to say goodbye to our Sydney so soon, but we are incredibly grateful for every precious moment that we shared with her. There are so many lives that Sydney touched. A piece of us will always be missing; she was a daughter, a sister, an auntie, a cousin, a granddaughter, a friend, and to us, the Fourth Amigo. The three of us feel so honoured to be writing this for her, and we each wanted to share a little bit about what she meant to us.</p><p>As Sydney once said, we were blessed with a best friend since birth. I am so thankful I got to grow up with Syd; all the memories, laughs, love, lessons and growth. \"Growing up with you as a best friend is the best thing that's ever happened to me!\" Syd was more than just a friend or a sister, she was my person. We were always together, like two halves of a whole. I was so at home with Syd as we talked about anything and everything. We always wanted to be best friends, just like our Dads, calling each other every day. We joked that our kids would have no choice but to be best friends as well. I can't believe how much we've been through, and I am so thankful that we had each other through each challenge and celebration. I wouldn't be who I am without Syd &amp; - she always has and always will inspire me. Words can't express how much she meant to me and so many other people. Thanks for all the memories Syd. I'm going to miss our 'Syd and JC time,' but I know that someday I will squeeze you tight and listen to the enthusiastic stories that only you can tell.</p><p>Syd often said that Living Springs Bible Camp was her favourite place on earth and I feel so lucky to be the one who introduced her to such an important part of her life. She came to camp with me for the first time in 2011 and after that nobody would have been able to stop her from going back. She spent the majority of the summer there the past five years, and touched so many lives through her time there. But to me, Syd was so much more than just someone I spent the summer with. She was the first person I went to about everything; I knew that no matter what, I could always tell her what was on my mind. She was my shoulder to cry on, the source of my greatest laughter, and she was never afraid to call me out when that was what I needed. No one could ever replicate that special Sydney-and-Kaylin bond. Even though she isn't physically here anymore, she will definitely continue to have an impact on who I am for the rest of my life.</p><p>The relationship between Syd and I was truly one-of-a-kind. Everyone described us as so similar, but at the same time so different. She was the forest fire to my tsunami; I know she would really enjoy it if we stuck a good Zodiac reference in here somewhere, and since she was a Leo (fire sign) and I'm a Pisces (water sign) I thought that would be a suitable metaphor for our relationship. The two of us really pushed each other to our limits, in the best possible way. We challenged each other's beliefs, and we were always able to go from the Silent Treatment on Saturday to singing Hamilton songs in the car on Sunday. We fought like true sisters, but through every fight and argument, we always came out as stronger friends. I knew she was someone I could go to with anything, no matter what. It didn't matter the mountain we had to climb, our friendship was built to stand the test of time; I believe that it still will. Syd and Quinn will always be a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>The immensely special bond that Sydney had with her family was expressed through so many of her stories. Anyone who knew her, knew how much they all meant to her. We all refer to 'Nana and Papa, Auntie Carrie and Uncle Wooh,' Ireland and Presley as our family. Curt, Candace, Kenny and Taylor are like our family as Syd graciously shared them with us since her love for them overflowed to all those around her.</p><p>Syd demonstrated her love for her family by sharing stories with us constantly. There isn't enough paper in the world to share all the countless memories.</p><p>She loved spending time with Nana and Papa, helping in the garden, cooking, and looking at pictures. She knew that Auntie Carrie and Uncle Wooh always had her back; if she forgot her wallet going to the Meat Market, she wouldn't be leaving without food. Syd would always hype Presley and Ireland up about their style, loving their individuality and encouraging them to embrace who they are and to be so 'freaking' proud. Sydney was always ready to help people. Being Taylor's Maid of Honour and helping her after Isla was born was such a privilege and joy for her. Syd and Kenny may look a lot alike, but their personalities kept each other balanced. Sydney always had big dreams, like her dayhome, but Kennedy was someone who supported her and made it so successful. Kennedy was always by Syd's side, walking with her until their feet were bleeding just so they could see Nana and Papa. Curt and Candace were kept on their toes from the moment she was born. She had such a zest for life that they will always hold dear. Once Syd got an idea in her head, like marrying Harry Styles, she always made her parents laugh. Even so, they were right there listening to his music and getting her concert tickets and merchandise. So many are like family to the Hunters and Syd was so proud to share them.</p><p>It isn't easy to describe Sydney, but it will be so easy to remember her. Anyone that was lucky enough to meet her will tell you the same. There just aren't enough words in the world to do this beautiful young woman justice and to describe the love and light she brought to every single life she touched. Sydney felt so blessed to have been able to impact so many young lives. It doesn't feel real yet; we're still waiting for her to call so we can finally tell her about how crazy this is. Sydney Grace Anne Hunter was that one of a kind, once in a lifetime soul that we will never be able to replace. Our friendship was supposed to last a lifetime, but God had other plans for her. In her short 20 years, she left us with a lifetime of love and memories which we will cherish forever.</p><p>Oh man Sydney, will we ever miss you here on Earth, but we can't wait until we get to see you again. There were so many things we were still supposed to do, and it almost seems impossible to imagine what our future looks like without you. Though there will forever be a missing piece in our hearts, we know that you'll still be right there with us wherever we go.</p><p>READ MORE: OBITUARY: Sydney Grace Ann Hunter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BASHAW-4109235</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BASHAW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61WJ-B2V1-F103-34P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459599</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

Crews from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry are working on containment, including both ground and aerial suppression with five water bombers. At this time, the Municipality of Red Lake is advising all residents to evacuate the municipality. PureGold has temporarily suspended operations, maintaining a security force at site while the fire is being contained. The Company is closely monitoring the regional situation.

ADALSTEINN BROWN (Science Advisory Table Co-Chair): Under the five percent growth rate, before the end of December, we are between 6,000 and 7,000 cases a day, compared to the three percent where we would be between about 3,000 and 4,000 cases per day. So it's important to note that even small changes in the rate of growth result in large changes in the number of cases. The three day rate of growth a few days ago was about five percent. It's now six percent. And so if the last few days is a reasonable point of extrapolation, it's fair to say that the five percent is a current or maybe even a slightly opposition scenario.</p><p>EVAN SOLOMON: I know that doesn't sound scary, but what he just said is scary. That's Ontario announcing new modelling that warns the province could see 6,000 cases a day by mid December in the worst case scenario. As Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott are facing a backlash from all sides after the Toronto Star reported the province rejecting advice from some doctors, including its own public health agency. One expert said they didn't even see the final framework until it went public. This comes with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing across province. Ontario hit another daily record today, reported 1,575 infections, fifth record in six days. And as we say, the December projections could get so bad hospitals would be overwhelmed in the worst case scenario. So has that province, and what about Quebec, and Manitoba, and Alberta, and rising cases in BC? Are we losing control of this pandemic? The press gallery is here. Joyce Napier, the Ottawa bureau chief for CTV National News; Vanmala Subramaniam is the reporters with The Logic; Tom Mulcair is a political analyst for CTV News, he had an illustrious political career leading the NDP; Dr. Abdu Sharkawy is CTV News infectious disease specialist, and I affectionately know him as the shark, and the shark is with us as well. Doc, I got to start with you. We always thank you for your frontline work, and your tireless work. First of all, what was your reaction to the Ontario framework that will make a real shutdown occur, the heavy restrictions, at 100 cases per 100,000, or 10 percent positivity rate, not 25 cases per 100,000 or the 2.5 percent rate of positivity that other doctors had recommended?</p><p>DR. ABDU SHARKAWY (CTV Infectious Disease Specialist): Well it's patently dangerous and irresponsible, quite frankly. I think that if you look around the world, and you look at what epidemiology tells us about exponential growth of a very lethal virus, once you're approaching three to five percent you're in big trouble already. And to have that number go up to ten percent is essentially waiting for a forest fire to happen before you're pulling out your hose. These are very dire times we are living in. These projections are nothing short of horrifying. As frontline care physician, you know, I just shudder at the thought of not being able to care for my patients, COVID and non-COVID alike, when these numbers are trending the way they are. It's absolutely horrifying.</p><p>SOLOMON: Tom, you're listening to Dr. Sharkawy, horrifying, irresponsible. What do you make of the situation in Ontario, and Quebec, and where, by the way, Quebec warned they could shut down schools today. Things are getting out of control here, Tom.</p><p>TOM MULCAIR (CTV Political Analyst): Things are getting out of control in the schools right now, and the numbers in Quebec over the past couple of days, culminating with yesterday and today have just been horrifying. But at the same time, a lot of public health people warned Premier Legault to simply cancel Halloween. We're twelve days after Halloween, which is right in line with the incubation period. So a lot of people said just don't do it. He said, no, no, we're going to tell people to be careful, but there were hundreds of thousands of kids in the street, and now we're finding out that one of the principle vectors here in Quebec of course are the schools. So we're very worried about the Christmas holidays. Now they're thinking of saying, well everybody is going to get a month of Christmas. That gives time essentially to avoid, you know, to watch out for that fourteen day period, the quarantine, but I'm not sure that it's an answer because 12 days after Christmas or New Years we're going through this same sort of spike. We haven't learned anything. I think that that's the problem when the politicians are making the announcements as opposed to the public health officials. The ones who are just doing public health tend to do a lot better.</p><p>SOLOMON: Joyce, let me bring you in. Doug Ford made a point today. He said, look, I've got to balance the health of the economy with the health of our citizenry. But are they making a mistake? Are we opening up too quickly, and you just can't have it both ways? Or maybe you can.</p><p>JOYCE NAPIER (CTV News): Well I don't know if you can have it both ways. And I hear what Dr. Abdu Sharkawy is saying, and it's kind of scary. And if he's saying it, it's got to be true because he's on the front lines. But there are other questions. The government was offered, these provincial governments were offered $19 billion from the federal government, lots of money, and the sky is the limit. Probably the first time in a century where the federal government is actually not arguing with the province about the money, but telling them, tell us how much you need. So are there more beds than hospitals? Has this money gone to hospitals? How are the ICU, are there more beds there? Have we opened critical care wards? What has happened with this money? And maybe Abdu Sharkawy knows it, but that's what we should look at more than, you know...</p><p>SOLOMON: Joyce...</p><p>NAPIER: ...are we opening too soon too fast. We have to know what is the government doing for contact tracing? What are we doing for testing? Are we getting these tests fast enough, so there's a lot of other things that they could be doing right now that would be very helpful.</p><p>SOLOMON: All right, guys, can you can take a pause?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61B4-P4R1-JCF0-K3TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CTV Televisions, Inc.

The Property grid will cover a total area of approximately 18 km E-W along the general strike of the VMS mineralization and 5km N-S with three 1 km steps to encompass the claim location. The Piper Aztek aircraft will fly daily from Thunder Bay 310 km SW of the Property. (figure class=\"image\")(/figure) Figure 2. Melchett Lake Claims showing location of MPX Geophysics airborne survey (UTM WGS 84) using 100m N-S flight lines and 1000m E-W tie lines. Base map - World Imagery.</p><p>The survey will collect magnetic, radiometric and VLF EM data supported by leading-edge positioning and processing equipment, both in the aircraft cabin and on the ground with the GEM Systems GSM-19 Base Station Magnetometer and a field data processing workstation.</p><p>The aircraft airspeed will be approximately 130-150 knots. Optimum terrain clearances for the aircraft and instrumentation (magnetometer, spectrometer, VLF) during normal survey flying are 70 metres. Vertical position along flight lines will be established using a pressure altimeter, a radar altimeter and GPS height. Final horizontal survey positions will be computed from differentially corrected GPS to a precision of 1m.</p><p>The attitude and motion of the aircraft in flight, with respect to the Earth's magnetic field vector, will be monitored/recorded by a three-component fluxgate magnetometer (Billingsley TFM</p><p>The magnetic sensors utilized for the survey are Geometrics 822A or Scintrex CS3 high resolution cesium split-beam total-field magnetometer which will be installed in a tail stinger. Magnetic compensation of the acquired \"raw\" magnetometer data will be collected in real-time using the RMS Instruments DAARC500/ARC510 Data Acquisition and Aeromagnetic Real-Time Compensator (\"RMS\"), together with comprehensive and flexible data acquisition and recording.

The RS-500 supersedes all other airborne systems given its advanced DSP / FPGA technologies. The RS-500 is a fully integrated system that includes an individual Advanced Digital Spectrometer (ADS) for each crystal within the detector box.</p><p>The Totem VLF sensor utilized for the survey will be a RMSVLF system. This device contains three orthogonal coils, a signal amplifier and it has eight different frequency bands for different VLF transmitters. The VLF system is sampled in the 15-25 kHz. The VLF system employed is configured to simultaneously measure five transmitting stations.</p><p>MPX crews will carry out all field activities in Ontario under strictly adhered to corporate and client COVID safety protocols.</p><p>Property Highlights</p><p>The Property covers 4,716 hectares (230 single cell mineral claims and two multi-cell mineral claims) with VMS and Au targets located in east to southeast-striking, subvertical to moderately north-dipping quartz-sericite schists. These units exhibit steep down-dip to southeast raking or plunging lineations. The tightly folded nature of the Archean metavolcanics is evident as re-interpreted from historical mapping and geological logs, and 2002 Helicopter TEM and MAG survey and 2010 regional airborne magnetic survey, the latter shown on Figure 1. The Melchett Lake belt contains occurrences of polymetallic Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au VMS mineralization similar in several respects to deposits exploited at Geco, Mattabi, and Winston Lake, among others.</p><p>The claims to the east and west of the core Relf and Nakina targets cover 11 kilometres of known extensions of the Melchett Lake mineralized horizons and include high potential VMS and Au targets located along sub-parallel isoclinal fold limbs and/or oblique structural breaks interpreted from recently acquired exploration magnetic and GEOTEM data (see Press Release December 4, 2019). These targets exhibit either chargeable, weakly magnetic trends or coincident EM and magnetic responses with the latter related to variable oxide and sulphide content, including pyrrhotite and pyrite, with base metal sulphides and gold. Only limited and shallow exploration diamond drilling was conducted in both the Key Lake area to the west and Iron Lake area to the east.</p><p>Highlights of the prospective geology, alteration and mineralization include a strike extent of more than 20 km, multiple folded or stacked horizons of coincident alteration and metal mineralization, high Zn/Cu, Zn/Pb and Ag/Au ratios, increasing Cu/Zn at depth, extensive remobilization of major and trace elements with defined enrichment (Fe, Mg, Co, Cr, Cd) and depletion (Na, Sr, Ca) zones.</p><p>Surface samples, as shown in Figure 3, with Fe-sphalerite (blackjack or marmatite), contain locally high-grade lenses of Zn &amp;Ag with variable Cu, Au and Pb, and historical gold grades to 28.8 g/t Au, silver grades to 560 g/t Ag and zinc grades to 19.1%. (figure class=\"image\")(/figure) Figure 3. Zinc (Fe-sphalerite) mineralization in quartz-sericite-pyrite schist collected by Project QP from the main trench in the Relf Lake Zone.</p><p>Other than the two DDH SB drill holes, only limited and shallow historical exploration drilling was conducted in the Relf, Nakina, Half Moon, Key Lake and Iron Lake areas on the Property.</p><p>Increased alteration and anomalous metal values reported over large core intervals (up to 245 metres in DDH SB-07-01 from 345-590 metres) are accompanied by strong electromagnetic (BHTEM) off-hole responses in the deepest intervals of the last drill holes tested during 2007 (DDH SB-07-01) and 2012 (DDH SB-08-02).</p><p>The richest Zn mineralization in core was reported from DDH SB-08-02 and chalcopyrite occurred in stockwork-style veinlets. The deepest BHTEM Maxwell modelled plate, associated with these heavily altered and mineralized quartz-sericite schists and adjacent silica-rich metavolcanics in the Relf Zone, and which appears to plunge or rake to the east-southeast, remains undrilled to date.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Greg Davison, PGeo, Silver Spruce VP Exploration and Director, is the Company's internal Qualified Person for the Melchett Lake Project and is responsible for approval of the technical content of this press release within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), under TSX guidelines.</p><p>About MPX Geophysics Ltd.</p><p>MPX Geophysics is an international leader in airborne and remote sensing for the mining, O&amp;G, civil and environmental engineering sectors.

Melchett Lake Claims showing location of MPX Geophysics airborne survey (UTM WGS 84) using 100m N-S flight lines and 1000m E-W tie lines. Base map - World Imagery.</p><p>The survey will collect magnetic, radiometric and VLF EM data supported by leading-edge positioning and processing equipment, both in the aircraft cabin and on the ground with the GEM Systems GSM-19 Base Station Magnetometer and a field data processing workstation.</p><p>The aircraft airspeed will be approximately 130-150 knots. Optimum terrain clearances for the aircraft and instrumentation (magnetometer, spectrometer, VLF) during normal survey flying are 70 metres. Vertical position along flight lines will be established using a pressure altimeter, a radar altimeter and GPS height. Final horizontal survey positions will be computed from differentially corrected GPS to a precision of \u00b1 1m.</p><p>The attitude and motion of the aircraft in flight, with respect to the Earth's magnetic field vector, will be monitored/recorded by a three-component fluxgate magnetometer (Billingsley TFM 100G2 Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer), which is very sensitive to attitude changes.</p><p>The magnetic sensors utilized for the survey are Geometrics 822A or Scintrex CS3 high resolution cesium split-beam total-field magnetometer which will be installed in a tail stinger. Magnetic compensation of the acquired \"raw\" magnetometer data will be collected in real-time using the RMS Instruments DAARC500/ARC510 Data Acquisition and Aeromagnetic Real-Time Compensator (\"RMS\"), together with comprehensive and flexible data acquisition and recording. The RMS offers the ultimate in aeromagnetic compensation.</p><p>Radiation Solutions RS-500 multi-channel gamma-ray spectrometer with 33.6 liters \"downward looking\" NaI sensor, and 8.4 litres \"upward looking\" NaI sensor will be installed on the aircraft for the survey. The RS-500 supersedes all other airborne systems given its advanced DSP / FPGA technologies. The RS-500 is a fully integrated system that includes an individual Advanced Digital Spectrometer (ADS) for each crystal within the detector box.</p><p>The Totem VLF sensor utilized for the survey will be a RMSVLF system. This device contains three orthogonal coils, a signal amplifier and it has eight different frequency bands for different VLF transmitters. The VLF system is sampled in the 15-25 kHz. The VLF system employed is configured to simultaneously measure five transmitting stations.</p><p>MPX crews will carry out all field activities in Ontario under strictly adhered to corporate and client COVID safety protocols.</p><p>Property Highlights</p><p>The Property covers 4,716 hectares (230 single cell mineral claims and two multi-cell mineral claims) with VMS and Au targets located in east to southeast-striking, subvertical to moderately north-dipping quartz-sericite schists. These units exhibit steep down-dip to southeast raking or plunging lineations. The tightly folded nature of the Archean metavolcanics is evident as re-interpreted from historical mapping and geological logs, and 2002 Helicopter TEM and MAG survey and 2010 regional airborne magnetic survey, the latter shown on Figure 1. The Melchett Lake belt contains occurrences of polymetallic Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au VMS mineralization similar in several respects to deposits exploited at Geco, Mattabi, and Winston Lake, among others.</p><p>The claims to the east and west of the core Relf and Nakina targets cover 11 kilometres of known extensions of the Melchett Lake mineralized horizons and include high potential VMS and Au targets located along sub-parallel isoclinal fold limbs and/or oblique structural breaks interpreted from recently acquired exploration magnetic and GEOTEM data (see Press Release December 4, 2019). These targets exhibit either chargeable, weakly magnetic trends or coincident EM and magnetic responses with the latter related to variable oxide and sulphide content, including pyrrhotite and pyrite, with base metal sulphides and gold. Only limited and shallow exploration diamond drilling was conducted in both the Key Lake area to the west and Iron Lake area to the east.</p><p>Highlights of the prospective geology, alteration and mineralization include a strike extent of more than 20 km, multiple folded or stacked horizons of coincident alteration and metal mineralization, high Zn/Cu, Zn/Pb and Ag/Au ratios, increasing Cu/Zn at depth, extensive remobilization of major and trace elements with defined enrichment (Fe, Mg, Co, Cr, Cd) and depletion (Na, Sr, Ca) zones.</p><p>Surface samples, as shown in Figure 3, with Fe-sphalerite (blackjack or marmatite), contain locally high-grade lenses of Zn &amp; Ag with variable Cu, Au and Pb, and historical gold grades to 28.8 g/t Au, silver grades to 560 g/t Ag and zinc grades to 19.1%.</p><p>Figure 3. Zinc (Fe-sphalerite) mineralization in quartz-sericite-pyrite schist collected by Project QP from the main trench in the Relf Lake Zone.</p><p>Other than the two DDH SB drill holes, only limited and shallow historical exploration drilling was conducted in the Relf, Nakina, Half Moon, Key Lake and Iron Lake areas on the Property.</p><p>Increased alteration and anomalous metal values reported over large core intervals (up to 245 metres in DDH SB-07-01 from 345-590 metres) are accompanied by strong electromagnetic (BHTEM) off-hole responses in the deepest intervals of the last drill holes tested during 2007 (DDH SB-07-01) and 2012 (DDH SB-08-02).</p><p>The richest Zn mineralization in core was reported from DDH SB-08-02 and chalcopyrite occurred in stockwork-style veinlets. The deepest BHTEM Maxwell modelled plate, associated with these heavily altered and mineralized quartz-sericite schists and adjacent silica-rich metavolcanics in the Relf Zone, and which appears to plunge or rake to the east-southeast, remains undrilled to date.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Greg Davison, PGeo, Silver Spruce VP Exploration and Director, is the Company's internal Qualified Person for the Melchett Lake Project and is responsible for approval of the technical content of this press release within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), under TSX guidelines.</p><p>About MPX Geophysics Ltd.</p><p>MPX Geophysics is an international leader in airborne and remote sensing for the mining, O&amp;G, civil and environmental engineering sectors.

(The clock itself had been keeping time since May 31.)</p><p>In 1884, Louis Riel arrived in Saskatchewan to organize the Metis for what became the following year's North-West Rebellion.</p><p>In 1896, Wilfrid Laurier was sworn in as prime minister -- a post he held until Oct. 6, 1911.</p><p>In 1906, Sunday became an official day of rest in Canada. The Senate passed the \"Lord's Day Act\" which was approved in the House of Commons by Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government and supported by Protestant and Roman Catholic churches and labour groups. The act restricted business, prohibited entertainment, sport and almost all commerce on Sunday. The law remained on the books until the Supreme Court of Canada struck it down in 1985.</p><p>In 1911, the Canadian Professional Golfers Association was formed.</p><p>In 1911, a fierce forest fire broke out near Timmins, Ont. High winds fanned several fires into a single front 40 kilometres wide. It raged for more than a week -- burning 2,200 square kilometres and destroying the mining communities of South Porcupine, Cochrane and Goldlands. More than 200 people died, more than 3,000 were left homeless and property damage totalled $3 million.</p><p>In 1957, Bob Panasik of Windsor, Ont., became the youngest golfer to make the 36-hole cut in a PGA Tour event. At age 15 years and eight months, he qualified for the final two rounds of the Canadian Open in Kitchener, Ont. He finished tied for 66th place.</p><p>In 1960, a Northwest Territories council meeting was held at Resolute Bay, the most northerly point for any legislative meeting.</p><p>In 1960, Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was first published.</p><p>In 1962, the first trans-Atlantic television transmission was sent from Andover, Maine, to Pleumeur Bodou, France, via the \"Telstar 1\" satellite.</p><p>In 1966, George Ignatieff was appointed Canadian ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>In 1975, archaeologists working near the ancient Chinese city of Xian uncovered a huge collection of 6,000 terracotta warriors. They were built to guard the tomb of an ancient emperor.</p><p>In 1978, the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association signed a 17-year-old centre from Sault Ste.

His name was Wayne Gretzky.</p><p>In 1978, 216 people were immediately killed when a tanker truck overfilled with propylene gas exploded on a coastal highway south of Tarragona, Spain.</p><p>In 1979, after six years of orbiting the Earth, the U.S. space \"Skylab\" broke up and scattered debris over the South Atlantic, Indian Ocean and western Australia.</p><p>In 1980, L'Anse aux Meadows, on the northern tip of Newfoundland where Vikings formed a settlement more than 1,000 years ago, was declared the first World Heritage Site by a special United Nations committee. Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad found the site in 1960 after searching for the Vikings' trail along Newfoundland's coast for months, relying on 16th-century maps and ancient descriptions of Leif Ericsson's transatlantic voyage.</p><p>In 1985, Houston's Nolan Ryan struck out Danny Heep of the New York Mets to become the first baseball player to record 4,000 career strikeouts.</p><p>In 1989, Vickie Keith of Kingston, Ont., became the first person to swim the English Channel using the butterfly stroke.</p><p>In 1989, Sir Laurence Olivier, considered the greatest Shakespearean actor of the 20th century and a winner of the Academy Award for both acting and directing, died at age 82.</p><p>In 1990, the siege at Oka, Que., began. Quebec provincial police moved in to remove a barricade Mohawks had set up to block expansion of a golf course on indigenous land. The raid failed, but an officer was shot and killed. Mohawks at Chateauguay set up a sympathy blockade at the Mercier Bridge leading into Montreal, and indigenous groups across the country set up similar blockades.

A drier California means plants are more flammable.</p><p>The U.S. Forest Service's Pacific Southwest Region announced Friday that it is extending the closure of all nine national forests in California due to concerns including fire conditions and critical limitations on firefighting resources.</p><p>The threatened marijuana growing area is in the Emerald Triangle, a three-county corner of Northern California that by some estimates is the nation's largest cannabis-producing region.</p><p>People familiar with Trinity Pines said the community has up to 40 legal farms, with more than 10 times that number in hidden, illegal growing areas.</p><p>Growers are wary of leaving the plants vulnerable to flames or thieves. Each farm has crops worth half a million dollars or more and many are within days or weeks of harvest.</p><p>One estimate put the value of the area's legal marijuana crop at about $20 million.</p><p>\"There (are) millions of dollars, millions and millions of dollars of marijuana out there,\" Trujillo said. \"Some of those plants are 16 feet (5 metres) tall, and they are all in the budding stages of growth right now.\"</p><p>Gunfire in the region is common. A recent night brought what locals dubbed the \"roll call\" of cannabis cultivators shooting rounds from pistols and automatic weapons as warnings to outsiders, said Post Mountain volunteer Fire Chief Astrid Dobo, who also manages legal cannabis farms.</p><p>Hundreds of migrant workers typically pour into the area this time of year to help trim and harvest the plants, but it's uncertain whether that population dwindled due to the coronavirus pandemic, said Julia Rubinic, a member of the Trinity County Agriculture Alliance, which represents licensed cannabis growers.</p><p>Mike McMillan, spokesman for the federal incident command team managing the northern section of the August Complex, said fire officials plan to deliver a clear message that \"we are not going to die to save people. That is not our job.\"</p><p>\"We are going to knock door to door and tell them once again,\" McMillan said. \"However, if they choose to stay and if the fire situation becomes, as we say, very dynamic and very dangerous ... we are not going to risk our lives.\"</p><p>A firefighter was killed and another was injured on Aug. 31 while working on the fire. Diana Jones, a volunteer firefighter from Texas, was among 26 people who have died since more than two dozen major wildfires broke out across the state last month.</p><p>A memorial service was held Friday for a veteran firefighter, Charles Morton, 39, a squad boss with the Big Bear Interagency Hotshot Crew who died Sept. 17 while battling the El Dorado Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest east of Los Angeles.</p><p>\"I know that Charlie was a very skilled, in fact extraordinary, firefighter and a fire leader,\" U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told the gathering at The Rock Church in San Bernardino.</p><p>\"He committed himself, often for weeks and months on end, to protecting lives, communities and natural resources all around this country in service to fellow Americans.\"</p><p>The Butte County Sheriff's Office on Friday released the identity of another of the 15 people killed in a rampaging forest fire earlier this month. The remains of Linda Longenbach, 71, of Berry Creek, were found on Sept. 10 in a roadway about 10 feet from an ATV, close to the body of a man previously identified as Paul Winer, 68.</p><p>A relative told investigators the victims were aware of the fire and chose not to evacuate.</p><p>____</p><p>Associated Press writer John Antczak in Los Angeles contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dcdfa5f82a53302d4d9b9d22e1f5b320</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XN-9371-JBVR-32YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"995\"/><timeReceived>08:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of July 20, 2022 17 speed cameras of 22 were activated.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: JULY 15, 2022) Cashmere Avenue, between Paisley Boulevard West and Louis Drive in Ward 7 <br/><br/> Clara Drive, between Nethwerwood Road and Catalpa Road in Ward 5.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of July 26, 2022 18 speed cameras of 22 were activated.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> (NEW: JULY 15, 2022) Cashmere Avenue, between Paisley Boulevard West and Louis Drive in Ward 7 <br/><br/> Clara Drive, between Nethwerwood Road and Catalpa Road in Ward 5.

Even the moniker \"Crappy Tire\" tends to be used affectionately. Yet behind the scenes, the folksy chain has undergone a rapid transformation into a tech-forward, digital analytics-driven omnichannel powerhouse whose sales last year soared by 18 per cent, including a nearly 200 per cent spike in e-commerce. Greg Hicks admits this is not what he expected when he took the company's helm literally on the eve of the largest retail disruption in living memory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's almost exactly the one-year mark of your tenure as CEO, so happy anniversary.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yeah. Seems like five years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">When did you realize this was going to be a year like no other?</emphasis></p><p>The night before the CEO announcement the NBA cancelled the season and the day after the WHO declared a global pandemic. But at that point we were somewhat naive as to the severity of the situation. A couple days later, we were closing the offices and five days later we were shutting more than 1,000 stores. We played defence for six months where you're just reacting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you mobilize? Did you have war rooms to manage the response?</emphasis></p><p>We had an enterprise risk committee in place that would usually deal with isolated disasters like a flood or forest fire and there is a playbook you can pull out. In three days we realized that was not going to work, so we expanded the \"nerve centre\" to the top 35 or 40 leaders and for months we were meeting multiple times a day. In the early days, the head of the risk committee was playing point on required decisions and we literally knocked them down like dominoes one by one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Despite all that, you've had an outstanding year, largely by effectively tapping e-commerce. That was a channel where you had long lagged other retailers.</emphasis></p><p>We were in the process of methodical investment in our websites. Having demand accelerate the way it did certainly caught us by surprise and we had our share of hiccups, but the foundation we were building enabled us to respond quickly. First, we chose which parts of the website to own versus partner on. Sounds like a simple idea but those were critical decisions. We had been a build-from-within organization for a long time, but we brought in a new site search partner, a product recommendations engine and a site personalization engine. Second, we invested heavily in the Triangle [rewards program] and Canadian Tire app. Finally, and this one was key, we in-sourced in late 2019 our digital marketing capability, creating a centralized team of experts.</p><p>Our physical store reach also helped us thrive. Those assets are often overlooked when thinking about readiness for battle in e-commerce. But think of it this way: We had 22 million square feet of warehouse space that sits within a 10-minute drive of 90 per cent of Canadians, and those warehouses happen to have 25 million square feet of product showrooms attached to them where you can walk out with the product that day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait: you think of your stores as showrooms now?</emphasis></p><p>Traditionally no, but we're trying to find a way to explain why people shouldn't be surprised that we continue to thrive. The pandemic has solidified the fact that the physical store is absolutely critical. It allows us to present and merchandise inspiration in a way an online pure play can't, and it can be the epicentre of fulfilment. Whether we knew it or not, we've been getting ready for this consumer shift for a year. We're a much more digital company than we were 12 months ago.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What lessons from this past year are you going to take into the future?</emphasis></p><p>The biggest is how powerful it is to embrace progress over perfection. In crisis management, there just isn't time for the meeting before the meeting and the meeting after meeting, the hierarchies, the egos. The workplace is another obvious place to talk about. Flexibility is the new F word, and flexibility about where people work is here to stay. The next big adjustment will involve technology. No longer will technology be viewed as a separate function. Virtually every company is now a technology company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canadian Tire owns other retail banners, including SportChek, Mark's, Pro Hockey Life. One that's puzzling is Party City. How does that fit in?</emphasis></p><p>I've gotten that perplexed question before. This is the first time customer data shaped our acquisition target. The data from our Triangle program and credit card business showed us that Party City's customers skewed young and spent 60 per cent more at Canadian Tire than our average Triangle member. Party City has a small footprint in Canada but the people who live in those markets, who have our credit card, who are members of our program, can earn and redeem Canadian Tire money, and that kind of earn-and-burn cycle helps drive a flywheel of loyalty to the entire ecosystem.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In retail, experience and gut have long ruled decision making. How do you strike the balance between that human acumen and data analytics?</emphasis></p><p>A big chunk of my career was on the merchant side and there's a lot of intuition there. Now, \"I think\" is diminishing in our vocabulary and moving to \"I know\" because we have so much data and there is little room for subjectivity. Few meaningful decision-making protocols don't still have a mix of art and science, but some we once thought were exclusively art, like margin management, have surprised even the most devoutly old-school merchants. What I love about empirical data is that it can snap a debate into focus, as when a dealer is wondering whether they should take a deeper position in a certain category.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You have deep personal roots in that dealer network.</emphasis></p><p>Yes. My father was an officer of the company and went on to become a dealer. I had two uncles who were dealers and I worked in my dad's store. We had this cubbyhole underneath his office where you mixed paint for customers and he showed me how to use the machine and 10 minutes later I was working the paint aisle. I was maybe 15.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You've compared running Canadian Tire to nation building. The chain may be a fixture, but is that a stretch?</emphasis></p><p>Canada is just over 150 years old and we will celebrate our 100-year anniversary next year, so in a way we grew up with Canada. The way our history and values evolved have largely reflected Canadian values that are so different from our neighbours to the south and one substantial difference is the value we place on community over individual.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many people have gizmos that they never thought existed or they needed until they spotted them at Canadian Tire.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Monday, Nov. 21, 20 speed cameras of 22 were activated.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of Sept. 26, 2022, 17 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>(NEW: SEPT. 1, 2022) Bromsgrove Road, between Cramer Street and Tredmore Drive in Ward 2</p><p>(NEW: SEPT. 1, 2022) Churchill Meadows Boulevard, between Pearlstone Drive and Thomas Street in Ward 10</p><p>(NEW: SEPT. 1, 2022) Clarkson Road North, between Birchwood Drive and Balsam Avenue in Ward 2</p><p>Colonial Drive, between Galbraith Drive and Thorcrest Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of Thursday, Oct. 21, 19 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of July 8, 2022 15 speed cameras of 22 were activated.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras <br/><br/> Clara Drive, between Nethwerwood Road and Catalpa Road in Ward 5.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of Monday, Nov. 21, 20 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.
