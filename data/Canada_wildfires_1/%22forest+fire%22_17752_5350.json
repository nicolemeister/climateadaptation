Six bulldozers and 50 firefighters defended the hamlet's southern limits Saturday as water bombers hammered back the flames.</p><p>\"They did some excellent work along the southern edge of the fire there right on the edge of the town,'' Toker said. \"They have established a fire guard around the perimeter of the community and that will serve the people well.'' A municipal fire truck waited on standby Saturday to protect the buildings in the community. Toker said it was complemented by a rapid fire unit that uses compressed foam to protect the structures in the community.</p><p>Firefighters are also trying to protect another 12 unoccupied summer cottages in the area.</p><p>Chisholm is on the northern boundary of the 120 square kilometre fire that is now under attack from 200 firefighters and a fleet of helicopters, planes and heavy equipment.</p><p>Thirteen residents of Flatbush, about 20 km to the south, have been placed on evacuation alert, but winds blowing out of the east Saturday gave them some respite.</p><p>\"If necessary they will be instructed when it may be time to leave,'' Toker said from the scene as two CL-215 water bombers roared overhead.</p><p>About 30 people evacuated from farms north of Flatbush Friday have been allowed to return to their homes, but remain on evacuation alert, she said.</p><p>\"We're dealing with a fire and conditions that could change at a moment's notice,'' she added. \"While we're doing good work out here right now, we're taking every precaution. This is the largest fire we've had in Alberta this year.''</p><p>The Chisholm residents have been billeted with friends and family in the neighbouring towns of Smith and Slave Lake. Access to the community is blocked by manned barricades.</p><p>\"Because of the operations we have in the area, it's best we keep people back,'' Toker said. \"As soon as it is safe to get back in, the residents will be notified.''</p><p>Meanwhile, Transport Canada investigators were able to return on Saturday to the scene of a plane crash that killed two people who had been helping fight another fire Friday.</p><p>RCMP removed the bodies of the unidentified pilot and passenger of a forest fire spotter plane that crashed on the edge of fire burning northeast of Red Earth Creek, but had to evacuate the area when the fire came within a half kilometre.</p><p>The Cessna went down in dense forest in a hilly area near Trout Mountain. Police said visibility in the area was affected by fire smoke.</p><p>Red Earth Creek is about 425 km north of Edmonton.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-200105260027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YX-VM20-01G6-82DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>May 26, 2001 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This goes a long way to secure the perimeter of the fire.</p><p>The Incident Management Team continues to observe North Bay 18, 19, 46, 59 and 61. While these fires have been quiet, they are not considered out.</p><p>Currently there are 10 helicopters assigned to this cluster. Transitioning of staff is ongoing as personnel depart for their home locations and new staff arrive. Crews arrived from northwestern Ontario today and more are expected from Saskatchewan tomorrow.</p><p>The ministry continues to have firefighters from British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories and Mexico work on this cluster. Restricted Fire Zone expanded</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard, several recent periods of heavy lightning, little precipitation and increased forest fire, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone. This expansion of the current Restricted Fire Zone will be in effect as of 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, July 24, and remain in place until further notice.</p><p>The expanded Restricted Fire Zone now includes Zones 24, 25 and 26 which would include areas south of the French River, including Parry Sound, from Georgian Bay east to the Quebec border, including Algonquin Provincial Park and from Renfrew north to Mattawa.</p><p>To date, the current Restricted Fire Zone covers Zones 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25 and 26 and restrictions will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for an outline of the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris, is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>Ontario is receiving support from across Canada, the United States and Mexico to assist with the fire situation. Additional personnel and equipment are expected to arrive in the province in the coming days, including ignition specialists from Parks Canada.</p><p>Travel restrictions</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of North Bay, Kirkland Lake and Sudbury Districts where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity.</p><p>The Order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions.</p><p>This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use of the following roads are prohibited: McLaren's Road, Gibbons Road, Baie-Jeanne Road, South Pardo Road, Beauty Lake Road, St. Joseph's Road, George Gordon and Iron Lake Road, Cooke Lake Road, Liskeard Lumber Road, Klock Lake Road, Crane Lake Road, Roadhouse Tower Road, Indian Bay Road, Mountain Lake Road, and Goulard Road starting at Lower Goose Falls.</p><p>All modes of travel/access into Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater, Obabika River, Makobe-Grays River, Solace and Sturgeon River Provincial Parks, and all Crown lands is prohibited.</p><p>Use of the Red Squirrel Lake Road beyond the Barmac Gate is prohibited.</p><p>All use and occupation of Crown land on or within 500 metres of all described closed roads is prohibited.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for non-recreational purposes, please call North Bay District at 705-475-5546 (8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) or Kirkland Lake District at 705-568-3240 (8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) to request a travel authorization permit. For requesting access to Red Squirrel Lake Road, please call North Bay District. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>See the restricted travel and access areas on this PDF map (Note: this map gets updated regularly).</p><p>Smoke concerns</p><p>Many Ontario residents have reported smoke drift in their communities. Smoky conditions are expected to continue as a number of fires remain active throughout the northeast region until weather patterns and fire activity change.</p><p>The Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>To report a forest fire located north of the French and Mattawa rivers, please dial 310-FIRE (3473)</p><p>To report a forest fire located south of the French or Mattawa rivers, please dial 911.</p><p>Follow Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry on Twitter @ONForestFires</p><p>For up to date information on current fires in the province or to check the forest fire hazard in your area, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072946989992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXS-KX81-JDH3-G28T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The trouble is when you curtail you benefit someone else, which is why you always want to stay in the game,'' said Taylor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090728CPCPB3220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W88-SX01-2R6R-542J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 28, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No structures have been destroyed.</p><p>\"It's a very serious situation,\" Jerry Hagen, fire information officer with the U.S. Forest Service, said early today.</p><p>The fire in Custer State Park and the Black Hills National Forest was within 4 kilometres (3 miles) of Mount Rushmore this morning. All entrances to the park were closed yesterday.</p><p>\"The fire is extremely erratic and very frustrating to fight,\" Hagen said.</p><p>Brunner said the pace of the fire was slowed somewhat this morning when the winds shifted back toward the fire.</p><p>About 400 firefighters battled the fire in a steep, rocky area yesterday, but were forced to abandon their lines at nightfall. About 1,000 firefighters were expected to be on the scene early today.</p><p>Smoke was billowing thousands of feet into the air and the plume was visible from Rapid City 40 kilometres (25 miles) away.</p><p>A haze from the smoke hung over a large part of western South Dakota and was visible from Pierre, 256 kilometres (160 miles) away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR1988</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"298\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1988 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"07\" day=\"07\" year=\"1988\"><dateText>July 7, 1988, Thursday, FINAL EDITION</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>RAPID CITY JOURNAL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FOREST SERVICE \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>RAPID CITY JOURNAL\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FOREST SERVICE \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Wildfires 2018: Province calls for federal aid</p><p>Researchers found that the extreme high temperatures combined with dry conditions increase the likelihood of wildfire ignition and spread.</p><p>The 1.2 million hectares burned in 2017 set a record - only to be surpassed in 2018. Through their research, the scientists concluded that the area burned was seven to 11 times larger than would have been expected without human influences on the climate. The scientists also found this is a trend that is likely to intensify in the future, without further action.</p><p>RELATED: Ignoring climate change poses potential catastrophe for B.C.</p><p>According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, the extreme 2017 forest fire season in B.C. caused 65,000 people to be displaced from their homes, and millions to be exposed to smoke-filled air harmful to human health.</p><p>\"As the climate continues to warm, we can expect that costly extreme wildfire seasons - like 2017 in B.C. - will become more likely in the future. This will have increasing impacts on many sectors, including forest management, public health, and infrastructure,\" said Megan Kirchmeier-Young, research scientist, Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:keri.coles@blackpress.caFollow\">keri.coles@blackpress.caFollow</email> us on Instagram</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-3725779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V5F-19P1-F103-34M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"314\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vancouver Island Free Daily</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Shag Harbour fire destroyed a house, a mobile home and several sheds and hunting camps.</p><p>Last year, 338 fires burned 400 hectares of land in Nova Scotia over the entire forest fire season. Twice as much property has been destroyed so far this year.</p><p>\"We had very little snow this winter,'' said John Whidden, communications officer for the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>Prince Edward Island experienced a small rash of fires early last week, but rain over much of the province brought some relief.</p><p>There was also concern in Newfoundland, where roughly 40 fires were reported last week.</p><p>In contrast, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan have all experienced a quiet spring. Last year was one of the worst forest fire years on record for B.C. and Alberta.</p><p>\"What a difference a year makes,'' said Wendy Stewart, B.C. provincial fire information officer.</p><p>\"Last year at this time there were 325 fires burning. This year there are 1,000. We've had an extraordinary mix of weather over the last 18 months.''</p><p>In eastern Manitoba, four communities were hit hard in the first week of May and about 1,000 people registered as evacuees with the ManitobaRed Cross.

Another 200 people remained on evacuation alert.</p><p>The fire between Gun Lake and Tyaughton Lake has not grown since Tuesday, and is about 15 per cent contained, Steinbart said.</p><p>There were 100 firefighters, nine helicopters and heavy equipment tackling the blaze.</p><p>Elise Riedlinger, fire information officer for the Kamloops Fire Centre, said the focus for fire crews in and around Tyaughton is on protecting structures and property. So far, none have been damaged and the fire is up to 15 per cent contained.</p><p>''The weather continues to pose some challenges for the crews,'' she said. ''We're seeing very hot and dry temperatures and we're also seeing inversions, which are creating very smoky and hard-to-see conditions.''</p><p>Smoke from the Tyaughton fire forced Metro Vancouver to issue an air quality advisory for the Fraser Valley on Wednesday.</p><p>Another fire near the Yukon border, 220 kilometres west of Fort Nelson, has forced the closure of the Alaska Highway on and off, and travellers are advised to check for closures.</p><p>The fire threat is high to extreme over most of Vancouver Island, and relatively high throughout most of central and southern British Columbia.</p><p>Burning bans have been put in place in several regions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090603CPCPD9878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VVJ-D0H0-Y9NS-W05X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>June 3, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CA0Z</classCode><className>THERMAL SENSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX055</classCode><className>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS117</classCode><className>ALASKA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS178</classCode><className>YUKON TERRITORY, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Officials with the province's Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry said on Monday the fire has grown to encompass an area of 82 square kilometers (32 square miles).  \"We have seen some growth on Parry Sound 33,' ministry spokesperson Shayne McCool told CTV's Your Morning.[2] Forest fire update: Parry Sound 33 grows again, affected residents remain on standby      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/JuHue7FtW4https\">https://t.co/JuHue7FtW4https</url>://t.co/JuHue7FtW4[3] pic.twitter.com/Rbhl005F62[4] \u2014 CBC N.L. (@CBCNL) July 30, 2018[5]However you look at it, it definitely has been a record year for forest fires in Ontario. </p><p>McCool says this year's fire season has been fueled by lightning strikes and the lack of rain, creating dry conditions. So far this year, there have been 831 wildfires in Ontario, compared to an annual average of 511 over the past 10 years.  The ministry notes that of the 39 active forest fires burning in northeastern Ontario as of Monday morning, 14 - including the Parry Sound 33 fire are burning out of control. The other 25 are either under control, being held or being allowed to burn for ecological purposes. The cause of the Parry Sound 33 fire has not yet been determined, however, the majority of the fires have been sparked by lightning. 'Dry conditions in the forested areas have caused those fires to be ignited fairly easily,' McCool said. Trans-Canada Highway concernsAs the Parry Sound fire expanded its reach toward Canada's key transportation route,[6] there were fears southwesterly winds being experienced Monday morning would hasten the fire's movement. \"It certainly could impact visibility along the highway,' McCool said, adding that authorities would close the highway if smoke or fire led to a public safety concern. On the east side of the highway sits Grundy Lake Provincial Park, right in the fire's path. On Sunday, some 800 campers were told to leave the park. Other provincial parks have also been put off-limits due to forest fires, as has the French River. Over 556 firefighters from across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are working to control and extinguish the fires.

The telescope's location above cloud cover was selected to take advantage of La Palma's normally pristine skies.</p><p>The fire forced some 4,000 people to be temporarily evacuated from southeastern towns Saturday. Most have returned to their homes, some of which have been gutted by flames.</p><p>Ruano said the cause of the fire was still being investigated but said it may have been started by a firework rocket.</p><p>On the mainland, the northeastern regional government of Catalonia said a blaze that led to the deaths of five firefighters in a nature reserve near the town of Horta de Sant Joan, west of Barcelona, has finally been put out after 15 days.</p><p>That blaze had destroyed 1,140 hectares (2,800 acres) of woodland.</p><p>Wildfires have killed at least nine people and burned about 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) of forest and scrubland in Spain so far this year, more than double the amount burnt in all of 2008.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090804CPCPW2118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W9S-K420-Y9NS-W3SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 4, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DN62</classCode><className>FIREWORKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>PE0009UJ9</classCode><className>MADONNA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX308</classCode><className>BARCELONA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX307</classCode><className>MADRID, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A2MH</classCode><className>CATALONIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC623</classCode><className>CANARY ISLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR106</classCode><className>NORTHERN AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It began as a small fire a week ago about 40 kilometres from the community. Earlier this week, the winds picked up and it \"grew really fast,\" Meekis said.</p><p>Smoke began drifting into the community, prompting residents to close windows and doors, and shut down air conditioners.</p><p>Ultimately, the chief declared an emergency, and the initial transfer of babies, pregnant women and children under five and their families began. On Tuesday and Wednesday, a total of 227 people were flown about 330 kilometres south to Sioux Lookout, which has declared its own state of emergency aimed at defraying the cost of helping the arrivals.</p><p>Volunteers in the town were helping provide access to snacks, supplies and information, as well as responding to requests from the evacuees, a spokesperson said.</p><p>\"All evacuees are being housed at a local hotel, and a local restaurant is providing all of the meals,\" said Brian MacKinnon, the town's manager of corporate services.</p><p>\"(However), Sioux Lookout is presently at capacity with respect to the number of evacuees we can host.\"</p><p>As a result, the remaining evacuees, numbering more than 200, were being flown to Timmins, Ont., on Thursday, leaving just a skeleton crew in the community for security purposes, Meekis said.</p><p>\"They're moving people today, as we speak,\" Meekis said.</p><p>By noon Thursday, the fire was 10 kilometres southwest of the Keewaywin boundary, which is 12 kilometres from the town itself, according to the provincial Ministry of Natural Resources.</p><p>Jonathan Scott, an information officer with Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, said an incident management team was on site looking for \"aerial ignition opportunities\" in which fires are deliberately set to take the blaze to natural barriers and slow its spread. Crews and equipment were also in the area.</p><p>In all, more than two dozen fires are burning in northwestern Ontario, 12 out of control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019070554967932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGW-WH21-JDH1-C4SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

There is<br/>concern that a new weather system that is moving in could push a forest fire<br/>toward a town. A thousand residents have been reminded that they are on<br/>evacuation alert. Meanwhile, in Kelowna, the last 70 people who were forced<br/>from their homes have been allowed to go home. But as CTV's Mike Chisholm<br/>reports, on the fire line, there's still a lot to do.</p><p>MIKE CHISHOLM [Reporter]: It's been almost two weeks since the Okanagan<br/>Mountain Park fire broke out. Today, other than smoke in the valley, all appears<br/>quiet. On the edge of the nearby mountains, however, today's attack is being<br/>planned.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Our whole flank on this side that we've worked so hard<br/>at for the last eight days is going to get tested, and we'll see how good we did.<br/>Don't let your guard down now. Pay attention to our surroundings. It's still just<br/>as dangerous out there as it was when we started.</p><p>CHISHOLM: For Paul Pasutto and a crew of eight civilian firefighters, this is<br/>week two. Paul's brother, Rick, lives nearby, and when the call for help went<br/>out, Rick's brothers and friends pitched in.</p><p>PAUL PASUTTO [Business Consultant - Firefighter]: We're hooking up with<br/>guys that know exactly what they're doing. But after a day or two up here, you<br/>start to get the hang of the dangers, and keep your head up and just make sure<br/>everybody's communicating well.</p><p>CHISHOLM: The volunteer crew proved so effective, the BC Forest Service<br/>hired them. Now, the unit is one of the top crews on the mountain, dispatched<br/>to hot spots and flare-ups. It means pulling back quickly when the water<br/>bombers fly low overhead. Dropping their loads metres from where the<br/>firefighters are working. James Scramstad is a Kelowna dentist and a member<br/>of the team. A week ago, he got the call and gave up his dental tools for a fire<br/>hose.</p><p>JAMES SCRAMSTAD [Dentist - Firefighter]: Definitely a hot environment, but<br/>definitely a bit more exciting than being in the dental chair.</p><p>CHISHOLM: This fire is now in steep terrain on the edge of the Kettle Valley<br/>rail line. All the firefighters and equipment are amassed here, trying to keep the<br/>fire here from jumping the line, because if it does, there are no access roads<br/>above here, and the fire will become almost impossible to fight.</p><p>PASUTTO: Chris just said it's burning right up to the ridge. So, I think we've<br/>got to go down and nip that one first. He also told me there's no roads going<br/>up. So, the next section of this is going up to Big White.</p><p>CHISHOLM: Big White is a large ski resort. It could become the next victim if<br/>this fire isn't stopped here. Mike Chisholm, CTV News, on the fire line near<br/>Kelowna.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49F4-F150-00RJ-F02C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><timeReceived>23:00:00 - 23:30:00 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>CTV Television, Inc.</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 CTV Television, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate month=\"08\" day=\"31\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>August 31, 2003, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>BC FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>BC FOREST SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) _ Rain showers have done little to douse the threat of forest fires in British Columbia's Okanagan Valley.</p><p>A month-long stretch of hot, dry weather _ including a record-breaking 34.1 degrees at the Kelowna airport on Saturday _ has scorched the valley bottom and heightened fears of a busy wildfire season.</p><p>Environment Canada says the Central Okanagan had just 41 millimetres of precipitation from March to May this year, less than half the normal precipitation of 87 millimetres in that period.</p><p>In contrast, 80 millimetres fell during the same three-month period in 2003 _ the year a massive forest fire destroyed 239 houses on the southern fringes of Kelowna.</p><p>But Dale Bojahra of the B.C. Forest Service in Penticton said Monday that residents don't need to start watering their roofs just yet.</p><p>''We should have a normal summer if we get rain once a week for several weeks,'' he said. ''It's never a single weather event that determines a fire season.''</p><p>As an example, Bojahra said, the dry spring of 2004 had many Okanagan residents worried they'd see a sequel to the Okanagan Mountain Park fire. It ended up being a slow fire season because there was enough rainfall that summer.</p><p>Still, indicators this year are disquieting. Craig Beeson of the B.C. Environment Ministry's water stewardship division said ''the snowpack in the Okanagan has been just below normal for the last few months.''</p><p>The greater the winter snowpack, the more moisture is absorbed into the ground.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20070605CPCPD8454</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4NWV-Y570-TX4V-K39N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"247\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>June 5, 2007 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DSJF</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DSJF</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park.

The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site. Winds from the west/southwest will occur again into today, possibly bringing more smoke into surrounding communities and along Highway 69.</p><p>An Evacuation Alert has been issued by the Municipality of French River for the Alban area, west of the high-powered hydro lines on Highway 64.

This will remain in place until further notice. See the fire map for the zones covered.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions in the Outdoor Fires Regulation (207/96).</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario Ministry of Resources and Forestry expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>For details on travel restrictions in the Parry Sound and Sudbury districts visit Ontario.ca/forestfire.</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>Waterways - All travel and use of the Pickerel River west of Hwy 69 to Bear Island and Key River west of Hwy 69 to Georgian Bay including all access from Georgian Bay on those water ways entering the fire perimeter or adjacent to it on its northern boundary, is prohibited during the daylight hours of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. unless authorized by travel permit issued by Parry Sound District or Sudbury District Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>Roadways - All road access west of Hwy 69 south of Pickerel River in Mowat Township and the unsurveyed lands to the southern border of Henvey Inlet 2 Indian Reserve is prohibited unless authorized by travel permit issued by Parry Sound District or Sudbury District Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>Fire Perimeter - There is no access permitted within the fire perimeter as shown on the map unless authorized by travel permit issued by Parry Sound District or Sudbury District Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF).</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>SMOKE CONCERNS</p><p>Smoke from large fires across the region will be visible until fire activity is reduced and weather patterns change.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services is reminding the public that if they do see flames or smoke, please report it, and stay away from the area in the interest of public safety.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about smoke and your health, please contact Tele Health Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For inquiries about Grundy Lake Provincial Park closure: 705-383-2286 or 705-795-0803</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p><p>PARRY SOUND - UPDATE (Thursday, Aug. 9, 3:29 p.m.) Parry Sound 33 is now listed by the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry as \"being held.\" The size of the Parry Sound 33 fire remains at 11,362 hectares.

Crews continue to make excellent progress in critical areas, especially along the northeast side of the fire near the Pickerel River. Higher winds out of the southwest today tested the northeast perimeter, but the hose lines held and kept the fire's spread in check. It is estimated that most of the east flank has been tied with hose line.</p><p>On Thursday, August 2, waterbombers and helicopters worked in conjunction with the crews to help tie off areas of activity. The fire remains south of Key Harbour, and north of the Henvey Inlet waterway. Crews are working on perimeter containment on the southeast side of the fire north of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>The west side of the fire remains unchanged; the fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. Crews continue suppression along the western flank of the fire. Structural protection continues.</p><p>Even with Thursday's winds, the fire remains approximately five kilometers away from Highway 69 and less than one kilometer south of the Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of Highway 69. Today's weather calls for another day of southwesterly winds.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Wednesday, August 1, 11:55 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 11,039 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>The ministry reports recent weather allowed more accurate aerial mapping of the fire and aerial ignition in the southeast added to the increased size. Fire behaviour was less active yesterday, August 1, as high humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. Winds were generally out of the east today and changed the fire's direction of spread to the west. Hose lines on the west side of the fire held the fire's spread in check.</p><p>The ministry reports that excellent progress was made on the eastern side of the fire as crews were able to establish lines due to reduced fire behaviour when compared to previous days. Crews are laying hose from the Pickerel River south to establish a perimeter on areas that have passed over the CN line. Structural protection continues along the Key and French Rivers.</p><p>Crews continue to work the perimeter of the fire by the north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters remain along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Aerial ignition occurred in the southeast part of the fire removing hazardous fuels and tying the fire into the northern shore of Henvey Inlet.</p><p>Even though the focus of aerial fire suppression is on the northeast side, crews continue to supress and monitor all portions of the fire. The fire remained quiet in the vicinity of Fox Island on the western perimeter. North and east winds yesterday, August 1, made for smoky conditions in communities to the south. Winds are forecasted to be out of the south today, August 2, moving to the southwest in the afternoon. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River near the CN trestle bridge on the west side of highway 69.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Tuesday, July 31, 10:45 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire has grown to 10,139 hectares in size, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 31, fire behaviour was less active as humidity levels and cloud cover aided in fire suppression. The northeast portion of the fire closest to the Pickerel River was the most active part today. Winds from the southwest pushed some activity along the Pickerel, but it's still holding south of the river. The northeast corner of the fire is tucked along the west side of Little Canoe Channel. Ignition operations in that area were completed Tuesday evening, July 31, to tie the fire together and slow its progression down.</p><p>Structural protection continues. Additional protection occurred along the Key and French Rivers with sprinklers set up in noted priority zones. Crews worked the perimeter of the fire by continuing hose line north and northwest of Key Harbour. Sixty firefighters were placed along the east side, south of the Key River to continue perimeter containment. Even though the focus is on the northeast side, the ministry continues to supress and monitor all portions of the fire.</p><p>Winds are forecasted to be out of the north today, Aug, 1. The fire is approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of Pickerel River.</p><p>The Municipality of Killarney issued an evacuation order for residents in the areas of Travers, Allen, Struthers, Kilpatrick, Bigwood (including Hartley Bay Road), a portion of Mowat, the Unsurveyed Area, 14 Mile Island and French River Provincial Park. For information, call the municipality at 705-287-2424.</p><p>PARRY SOUND -- UPDATE (Monday, July 30, 11:52 p.m.): The Parry Sound 33 forest fire reportedly expanded by 749 hectares on Monday, reaching 8,973 hectares, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services. The fire is now approximately five kilometres west of Highway 69 and less than one kilometre south of the Pickerel River.</p><p>On Monday, July 30, winds occurred from the west/southwest. The northeast and east portions of the fire were the most active and a few of these sections progressed eastward towards the CN Line. Crews have been working hard to slow the fire's progression in this part of the fire.</p><p>Structural protection continues, with sprinklers set up on structures along the Pickerel and Key Rivers, as well as on structures along the French River on Hartley Bay Road.</p><p>Crews worked on the southeast portion to hold the perimeter and complete hose line, while water bucketing and water bombers along the east flank continued aerial suppression efforts to attempt to close in the fire.</p><p>The ministry reported that although the focus is currently on the northeast side, they continue to suppress and monitor all portions of the fire. Aerial ignition on portions of the fire near Fox Island have brought the fire to natural boundaries removing the fire hazard in this area.</p><p>The fire behaviour today, Tuesday, July 31, is expected to remain the same as Monday. High temperatures mixed with low humidity will be present on the fire site.

There were no immediate reports of damage to the northern Greek peninsula's 20 medieval monasteries, which visitors can only access by sea.</p><p>Firefighters managed to prevent the flames from sweeping through Ouranoupolis, a resort village north of the peninsula, on Thursday, although the fire damaged outlying building and elderly people and others were taken to a nearby beach as a precaution. The fire brigade said in a statement that 110 firefighters, assisted by water trucks, five water-dropping aircraft and two helicopters were trying to contain the blaze.</p><p>The fire brigade did not have an estimate of the extent of the burned area.</p><p>Greece is in the grips of a heat wave, and wildfires have been burning around the country. In the southern Peloponnese area, firefighters were trying to extinguish two big fires in the areas of Tripoli and Corinth that broke out on Tuesday and destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scrub. Officials said no inhabited areas were under threat, and the blazes seemed to be on the wane Thursday.</p><p>A 45-year-old Greek man was arrested and charged with accidentally starting the one fire, in the Tripoli area, which has been declared in a state of emergency.</p><p>Forest fires are common during Greece's typically long, hot summers.

When I got here it was all smoke, and flames were licking and going like hell,'' he said.</p><p>The unusual winter bears a disturbing resemblance to conditions that preceded huge forest fires in the early 1980s.</p><p>\"People who have been in the business for a long time talk about back in the early '80s and how this past winter has been so similar to some of those years,'' Lund said.</p><p>\"We are gearing up.''</p><p>More than 1.3 million hectares of Alberta trees were destroyed in 1981 - the worst forest fire year of the 1980s.</p><p>Most of the fires occurred in the north - the result of lightning strikes in tinder-dry forests.</p><p>The average yearly land loss to forest fires in Alberta is 15,000 hectares, but 1995 was especially bad when 340,000 hectares were destroyed. By comparison, 1997 was a mild year with only 4,724 hectares lost.</p><p>As of April 21, there had been 63 grass and bush blazes this year, said Kelly O'Shea with the Environment Department. That's more than three times the number in the same period last year.</p><p>Forest fires will begin breaking out when treed areas dry up as well, said O'Shea.</p><p>Rain is desperately needed, agrees John Cook of Saskatchewan's provincial forest fire centre in Prince Albert.</p><p>\"We need precipitation of some kind in every place,'' he said.</p><p>It's especially dry in west-central Saskatchewan, where two huge grass fires have been burning for several days. So far this year the province has had 20 fires.</p><p>Surface material - pine needles, leaves and grass - is extremely dry and the forest is at high risk until it greens up, Cook said. Burning permits are required for anyone within four kilometres of a provincial park.</p><p>The unusually dry conditions are being attributed to El Nino - the nickname for the overheating of the equatorial Pacific, an event that occurs every four to seven years and causes havoc with the world's weather.</p><p>While the El Nino phenomenon usually peters out in March, followed by a wetter than normal spring and summer, weather forecasters say this year's El Nino has been so strong that dry conditions could persist well into July.

The other one is to burn up the duff layer - the organic layer that's on the forest floor - so that seeds can be accepted into mineral soil.\"</p><p>The pitch pine is also of particular significance to the park, which sits on the Canada-U.S. border, some 300 kilometres east of Toronto.</p><p>\"They're very representative of the area,\" Leggo said. \"They're certainly an important part of the Thousand Islands ecosystem.\"</p><p>Tuesday's efforts, which sent up billowing plumes of grey smoke above Camelot Island, were only given the go-ahead late last week when park staff realized the ideal conditions - or \"prescription window\"- was approaching.</p><p>\"On Friday, it was a go,\" explained Leggo. \"These things come up pretty quickly and it's the sort of management action you kind of have to drop whatever you're doing for.\"</p><p>Waiting for the perfect time to carry out the prescribed fire was important because a blaze too strong or too weak would ruin the pitch pine's chances of flourishing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2014072429906149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CRR-9MW1-JDV5-F480-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

This worn poster reads, \"STOP ... DID YOU PUT YOUR CAMP FIRE OUT\" with a man carrying a fawn away from nearby flames.</p><p>In Parry Sound, forest fire legislation passed in 1878 proved to be ineffective, as the public remained indifferent toward fire prevention. In 1920, the Department of Lands and Forests was established when the Bureau of Mines separated from of the Department of Lands, Forests and Mines. The department was responsible for creating and administrating regulations for Crown land, forestry, fishing and wildlife protection, including forest fire fighting. Peter McEwen became the first head district forester in 1922 for Parry Sound and Muskoka.</p><p>McEwen was responsible for 75 seasonal patrol rangers and creating an effective forest protection system. In 1925, the permit system was instated, and enabled towermen to distinguish between controlled fires and forest fires. The department underwent multiple changes until 1972, when it was reamalgamated with the Department of Mines and Northern Affairs to form the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p><p>Forest fires are started by both natural and human causes, with more than half being attributed to human carelessness. While cozying up by the campfire is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and family, please exercise caution and comply with all local fire bans to help protect our forests.</p><p>Rachael Thiessen is the communications officer for The Museum on Tower Hill.

Crews continue to monitor weather and fire behaviour closely. Residents will see smoke in the area as crews continue suppression efforts. Values protection have been put in place in Key Harbour, along parts of the south side of Pickerel River and along a portion of the train tracks east of the fire.\"</p><p>A total of eight helicopters worked the fire on July 24.</p><p>As of July 24 the fire was at 5,612 hectares and still not under control.</p><p>The cause of the fire was originally stated as \"human\" on the MNR's website but that classification has since been removed, McCool said, to avoid public speculation.</p><p>\"Because the cause is still unknown at this time and it is under investigation.\"</p><p>(11:59 p.m., Monday, July 23) The Key River forest fire, known as Parry Sound 33, is now covering an area of 5,612 hectares and the restricted fire zone has been expanded to north of Rosseau.</p><p>According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services, Parry Sound 33 saw aerial fire suppression again on Monday, July 23. CL415s dropped water on the fire which was remapped at 5,612 hectares. Three heavy helicopters bucketed water to reduce the fire's intensity and co-ordinated with ground crews.</p><p>On July 21, the MNRF's Parry Sound district recommended that the communities, municipalities and townships within the area ranging from the western and northern borders of French River Provincial Park, east to Highway 69, and as far south as the south shore of the Key River; including all residents and members of the public on both the north and south shores of the French River, and the Pickerel River, as well as Hartley Bay impose a mandatory evacuation of their residents with boat access only.</p><p>There is also a recommendation by the MNRF Parry Sound district to impose an evacuation alert to all residents within this area who have road access to their residences or cottages. These residents should be prepared to evacuate pending a change in the fire situation.</p><p>In addition, the MNRF's Sudbury district has recommended that all residents along Hartley Bay Road be placed on an evacuation alert, pending changes to the fire situation.</p><p>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Conservation Officers have been on site helping notify the public of the situation, and facilitating this evacuation.</p><p>Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) has also been advised by Ontario Parks that the French River Provincial Park is fully closed west of Highway 69/400. All campers have been or are being evacuated. Ontario Parks has also suspended permit sales for the French River Delta and Pickerel River areas and are restricting entry to park users (everything west of Highway 69/400).</p><p>Henvey Inlet First Nation declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure. As of July 22, the community has successfully and safely evacuated all of its community members, who are receiving accommodation and food.</p><p>Due to the extreme fire hazard and the large number of wildfires burning, the MNRF has expanded the Restricted Fire Zone to include some areas of the southern region. The new zone includes areas north of the community of Rosseau, northwest to Caramat, over to the Quebec border along Hwy 11 (to north of Abitibi Canyon) and southeast to Renfrew. This includes Algonquin Park, Parry Sound, Lake Superior Provincial Park, the North Shore of Lake Huron, Wawa, and Hearst. To check out more specific boundaries, visit Ontario.ca/forestfire and click on the interactive fire map.</p><p>During a Restricted Fire Zone, the use of open fires - such as campfires, or burning of brush or debris, is restricted. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail, as well as financial responsibility for the costs incurred in fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Portable gas or propane stoves are permitted for use for cooking or warmth, though they should be closely monitored. Portable charcoal barbecues and Hibachis are not permitted unless within 100 metres of a dwelling, or within an organized campground.</p><p>Commercial campground operators may allow their guests to enjoy campfires during a Restricted Fire Zone period provided they meet certain conditions.</p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone is a temporary measure to reduce the number of new human-caused wildfires as the Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch of the Ontario MNRF expects the elevated forest fire hazard to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><p>By the evening of July 23 there were 55 active forest fires across the northeast. Of these, 21 are not yet under control, 34 are either being held, under control or being observed.</p><p>There was only one new start in the region today. Sudbury 92 located near Johnnie Lake in Killarney Provincial Park covers 0.1 of a hectare and is already under control.</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>Pursuant to the Emergency Area Order signed July 21, 2018, an Implementation Order has been issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry prohibiting access and travel in portions of Parry Sound District where there are public safety hazards as a result of increased fire activity from Parry Sound 33.</p><p>The order restricts travel, access and use in an identified area and may be modified regularly to reflect changing fire conditions. This measure has been put in place to ensure public safety while allowing fire personnel to safely and effectively suppress the fires in the identified area.</p><p>All travel and use on the French River waterway, Pickerel River (West of Hwy 69/400), Henvey Inlet, Key River basin, and all associated tributaries that access these river systems, including all access from Georgian Bay, and all islands on Georgian Bay within the French River Provincial Park boundaries, Dokis Island system, and Puddick island and all islands north of Henvey Inlet near shore is prohibited.</p><p>All access roads west of Hwy 69/400, from Henvey Inlet north to the French River area are closed.</p><p>If a member of the public believes that access within the restricted travel area is necessary for nonrecreational purposes, please call to 705-746-4201 to request a travel authorization permit. MNRF will review the request for access based on the rationale provided, local fire activity, and the potential fire risk.</p><p>For information about the fire situation: 705-564-6165</p><p>For inquiries about French River Provincial Park restrictions: 705-857-1630 ext 224</p><p>For Parry Sound District information, including all calls related to the recommendation of these evacuations and alerts, call 705-773-4218.</p><p>For updates on highway conditions, including closures, please call 5-1-1.</p><p>See the map at Ontario.ca/forestfire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018072546958177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWX-RBP1-F105-61K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

They don't even realize they've started a fire,'' Mirus explained about how an ATV can spark a blaze.</p><p>The fire, which has burned more than 28-square kilometres, was reduced to a smouldering blaze after 4.5 millimetres of rain fell Saturday night.</p><p>Mirus said the fire does not pose a direct threat to any community in the area and there have been no evacuations.</p><p>Marvin Hovorka, a local reeve, said there were 600 four-wheelers racing through the forest on Saturday, and he holds the derby's organizers and conservation officials equally responsible.</p><p>''Conservation is quick to ticket you if you have a bonfire, but this? They seem to stand back and say the public has a right to get out and four wheel. And when there's a hazard to the forest they don't get in a shut 'er down,'' Hovorka said.</p><p>A call to the organizer of the rally was not returned.</p><p>Conservation officials were careful Sunday night to point out they had to look at other possible causes, too, such as a lit cigarette thrown from a car window.</p><p>''We're not looking at just the ATV derby but there were 600 ATVs in that area where there were dry conditions (and) we are highly suspicious that is probably our cause. But until our investigators find out we really can't point any fingers,'' Mirus said.</p><p>Conservation officials said the Manitoba Forest Act, unlike laws regulating provincial parks, doesn't require permits for any recreational activity like ATV derbies.</p><p>Mirus said after crews finally put the fire out and pin down the cause, officials may need to take a second look at the law.</p><p>(Winnipeg Free Press)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20080525CPCPG5322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SKS-J940-TX4V-K1PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>May 25, 2008 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT POLITICS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM4V</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DO78</classCode><className>ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM4V</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Store owners and others critical to getting things up and running again were to be first in line, said Norm Vetter, emergency Social Services manager.</p><p>''There are a number of other key community people that need to return to help the community organize ... and help personnel to operate the health clinic,'' said Vetter.</p><p>''There have been a number of those people that are identified that it's critical to get them in right up front. Then we'll be looking at the general population and develop a strategy on that.''</p><p>Wollaston Lake is about 840 kilometres north of Saskatoon and can only be reached by air at this time of year. Almost everyone was airlifted out last week to shelters in Saskatoon and Prince Albert when the fire flared at the edge of town. Military aircraft were called to help when smoke closed the airport.</p><p>The fire, which was first reported to Saskatchewan Environment on May 30, had eaten through roughly 45 square kilometres by Monday. It was fuelled by bone-dry conditions in grass, bushes and trees.</p><p>The fire was still considered out of control, but hadn't grown in recent days.</p><p>Steve Roberts, the province's head of wildfire management, said the fire was burning away from the communities.</p><p>''A fire control perimeter has been established around the communities and the airport. Direct threat from the wildfire has been reduced, but smoke will continue to remain an issue over the coming week or beyond, depending on weather,'' he said in a conference call.</p><p>There are about 30 homes in the hamlet of Wollaston Lake and another 193 on the reserve. Firefighters saved all the buildings, said Roberts.</p><p>Lightning has been ruled out as the cause of the fire. Roberts has said that the blaze was started by human activity, but it's not clear if it was accidental or intentional. A team of investigators was flown in Thursday to look at a forested area, near the end of the airstrip, where the fire started.</p><p>It's expected to take a couple of days to fly everyone back. Some high-risk people, such as small children or individuals with respiratory problems, may not go back right away because of the smoke.</p><p>Richard Kent, commissioner of emergency and protective services with the Prince Albert Grand Council, said people are anxious to go home.</p><p>''The evacuees have been looking forward to getting home, but they do understand and they were told that there will be smoke issues and the people that will be heading home will brought back in an orderly fashion by priority,'' said Kent.</p><p>''That's the way we pulled people out ... and that's the way we'll be going back.''</p><p>_ By Jennifer Graham in Regina</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20110606CPCPD5965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:531V-8N51-JCBG-93TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31601\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>June 6, 2011 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT DISASTER POLITICS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>N621400CC</classCode><className>CLINICS &amp; OUTPATIENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX002257</classCode><className>MILITARY AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000CP14</classCode><className>CONFERENCE CALLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
