The fire, known as Parry Sound 9, was located west of Highway 400 and south of Tower Road, south of MacTier in Georgian Bay Township, and measured 0.1 of a hectare. It had been declared out by the Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services division of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry by 6:25 p.m. that same day. </p><p>Parry Sound 9 was one of two new wildland fires confirmed in the Northeast region by late afternoon of Thursday, June 24. The second being Bancroft 11 located on an island in Lingham Lake, south of Bancroft. There are seven other active fires in the region, two are under control, five are being held and two are not yet under control. Previous fires in Parry Sound - Muskoka - Almaguin region that are now declared out, include: North Bay 13, was 0.2 hectares in size and located within Mattawa River Provincial Park, discovered Sunday, June 20 at 4:03 p.m. and declared out by Monday morning, June 21. North Bay 7 is also now out after growing to one hectare in size, discovered at 4:06 p.m. on Wednesday, June 16 at 0.6 hectares. The fire was located south of Lake Nipissing. A fire in the Parry Sound region (PAR007) was located in French River Provincial Park, south of the Pickerel River. It was confirmed late in the afternoon on June 9 and reached 2.7 hectares before being declared out on June 16. The fire hazard varies from low to extreme across the region on June 24. Areas generally located north and west of Sagamok and Englehart are showing a low to moderate hazard this afternoon, while areas south and east of these communities are showing a mostly high to extreme hazard. To see the fire hazard near you, check the interactive fire map at Ontario.ca/forestfire and check here for your West Parry Sound area municipality fire rating and here for Almaguin area fire ratings and here for Muskoka Fire Danger Ratings. Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services reminds the public to use caution when performing any outdoor burning. In order to dispose of yard waste and woody debris, we encourage you to use methods such as composting or using your local landfill. If you must burn, follow Ontario's outdoor burning regulations and check with your local municipality for the fire danger rating and rules surrounding it . Fires are to be ignited no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished no later than two hours after sunrise. Always have tools/water adequate to contain the fire at the site. To consult the full set of outdoor burning regulations under Ontario's Forest Fire Prevention Act, visit ontario.ca/page/outdoor-fire-rules-and-permits. To report a forest fire located south of the French or Mattawa rivers, dial 911.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210626TMUW1125699589929878711749354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6359-70Y1-JDV5-F3WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

As anticipated for more than 50 years now, the temperature and levels of atmospheric CO2 have increased. </p><p>Various models were able to predict these increases with precision, and we are seeing the impact now. One of the main effects of the changes in the atmosphere are frequent forest fires, which are more common globally and have affected Canada in the last month.</p><p>Complex models</p><p>Mathematical models to predict forest fire behaviours were first introduced in the 1940s and they have been evolving for decades. They consider various aspects and their complex interrelationships: the type of forest fuel (grass, shrub, small trees, large ones), the weather (wind direction, temperature, humidity), the topology of the terrain, and the source of the fire (human activity, lightning).</p><p>Modelling forest fires and forecasting fire behaviour is a complex endeavour. A model can anticipate the direction and intensity of the fire, and help with evacuation, fire suppression and forecast of smoke pollution. The models can predict fire spread, which helps protect human life, housing and infrastructure, including crucial utility companies assets.</p><p>Mathematical models are important, but in the case of forest fires, we also need to build simulation tools to be able to handle the complexity. We need to consider the different types of fire fuels in each region, the localized winds within forest fire areas, variations in climate, whether a fire spreads from the crown of the trees or on the ground, and other variations.</p><p>Using a computer to build a virtual laboratory for simulations helps with the prediction process in a safe, risk-free and cost-effective fashion. Experiments can be simulated on a computer to inform better decisions in the field, without affecting the environment, people or infrastructure.</p><p>Complex factors, small scale</p><p>Our lab \u2014 the Advanced Real-Time Simulation lab at Carleton University \u2014 has been working on new methodologies for modelling and simulation that improve results at a reduced cost. </p><p>We model forest fire behaviour at a microscopic level. This is because models that work on macro, or larger, scales have some constraints when we want to study the low-level interactions between fire, weather and suppression efforts. </p><p>Also, traditional models are harder to interface with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software applications. We need to be able to interface the models with real-world data coming in real time from a variety of sensors: spectrometers, satellites, infrared scanners, laser or 3D remote sensing devices. Building models that can react to external data needs new methodologies.  </p><p>Our approach divides the geographical space of a fire into small areas and calculates the complex phenomena. Many existing methods study the spread of fire by dividing the area of interest using a regular topology (for instance, rectangles, squares or triangles over the area of study), but these models are more complex to integrate with GIS, which use polygons of many different shapes. Building models with irregular topologies helps with obtaining more precise results. </p><p>These techniques help with creating models that are simpler to understand, test and modify.</p><p>Similarly, we need the simulations of such models to run efficiently. We defined new parallel simulation algorithms to generate a larger number of simulations in a shorter period of time, improving the quality of the results. </p><p>We also used advanced calculation approaches that include advancing the simulation time irregularly (when important events are detected), as well as techniques to detect higher levels of activity in the simulation. These techniques allow us to pay more attention to the forest fire sections that need more calculations per second, without computing the equations where they are not needed. This saves simulation time and improves precision of the results.</p><p>Informed decision-making</p><p>Numerous government agencies \u2014 such as the U.S.-based National Center for Atmospheric Research \u2014 use various modelling and simulation tools like FireSmoke, Fire M3 and FireMars. These tools include web-based support for decision-makers and provide information to the general public. </p><p>To improve such tools, advanced research is needed in the field of web-based modelling and distributed simulation, which allows the software to run in remote sites.</p><p>The future of forest fire research includes more sophisticated sensors, new artificial intelligence predictive methods, modelling based on Big Data algorithms and advanced visualization software to enhance the decision-making process. </p><p>We need to be prepared for future rounds of forest fires, and modelling and simulation can help in this complex effort.</p><p>___</p><p>Gabriel Wainer receives funding from NSERC. </p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

I just looked at the statistics and so far this year, the fires have burned just over one million hectares of forest.\u201d </p><p>Lacroix added that this year there have been 441 wildfires in Quebec and 1,360,850 hectares have been burned. For an average of 10 years by the same date, there\u2019s been 207 fires and only 1,000,346 hectares burned.  </p><p>Lacroix\u2019s tasks for the moment will be preventative methods to keep the fire from spreading.  </p><p>\u201cInitially, I was really scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt frightened me a little bit, but with the training, I feel very confident and everything is very safe. There are lots of protocols that are put in place and to my understanding, it\u2019s more like doing bush work than it is actually working on a fire. Yes, you\u2019re working on a fire, but I\u2019ve been working in the forest for a long time now and I feel very confident because of that. I know how to handle myself out there.\u201d </p><p>Mathieu Beaupre, Lacroix\u2019s Outland Quebec employer, has sent 84 of his employees to take part in the training and help out with the forest firefighting and says his team is well-suited for switching into firefighting duties. </p><p>\u201cWe already work with the SOPSEU firefighters in Quebec with catering, tree planting, brush cutting, and housekeeping for the concierge rooms,\u201d Beaupre said. \u201cThey call us when they need employees and ask if our tree planters want to train and learn the procedures, safety and helicopter rules to go help on the fires.\u201d </p><p>He said because firefighting in the forest is such a physical job they need people that are familiar and capable of working in the forest. </p><p>\u201cWe are in the town of Normetal where the fire is very close, 500 metres to the town. At this point, (the situation) isn\u2019t as critical as it was four or five days ago but we never know what the wind will do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always depends on the wind and we think tomorrow the fires are supposed to turn to the city.\u201d </p><p>This is where Lacroix and her team will be working. At least 12,000 people have been evacuated from the town and other areas have been issued air quality alerts and urged to remain indoors out of the smoke. Beaupre says it could be more than a month before his teams return to their regular jobs.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c364b82c9d1245238a0cad07e314a38b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FB-D5C1-JBVR-3303-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 10, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097YK</classCode><className>RECRUITMENT &amp; HIRING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

BCWS, meanwhile, will transition some of its existing training programs and courses into the centre. It will eventually offer more than 1,000 workshops per year by 2028-2029, translating into 10,000 course registrations, Ralston added.</p><p>The centre is among what Eby called the \"flag-ship recommendations\" of the task force established after last year's record-setting wildfire season. It affected 2.84 million hectares. It also destroyed or partially damaged 600 residences. Almost 49,000 British Columbians received evacuation orders and 137,000 received evacuation alerts. Six firefighters lost their lives.</p><p>RELATED: B.C. residents asked to prepare for a \"challenging\" wildfire season</p><p>RELATED: B.C. launches task force to deal with climate emergencies</p><p>Overall, the task force made 31 recommendations organized around key themes, which were released Thursday. They include enhancing the use of current and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence; better planning for the incorporation of local resources in responding to wildfires; and modernized and enhanced delivery of emergency support services, including post-wildfire support.</p><p>The province has already announced the implementation of several recommendations, with funding for them already in this year's budget. They include hiring more firefighters, including more from rural and remote regions of the province; expanding the available fleet of fixed-wing-aircrafts and helicopters; and purchasing additional equipment along with other measures designed to improve prevention of fires.</p><p>Eby also stressed that B.C. will have the financial resources as the wildfire season unfolds.</p><p>Thursday's announcement comes as the province prepares for what officials say could be a challenging fire season, a point underscored with a wildfire deemed to be out of control burning south of Kamloops near Merritt. Eby used his opening remarks to underscore the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>\"In the the last three, we have seen two of the worst forest-fire seasons our province has seen and the trend is clear and profoundly concerning,\" Eby said. \"The snowpack is much lower than normal, many parts of the province are at the highest level of drought and the fire threat is very profound,\" he said.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20240404PAB4588813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BPY-M5S1-JD2C-J03F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Group Ltd.

High levels of air pollution have developed due to smoke from forest fires.</p><p><br/><br/> Smoke plumes from forest fires in Quebec have resulted in deteriorated air quality. Poor air quality is expected to continue through Tuesday night for some areas.<br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007. <br/><br/> Air quality due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming.

The carbon tax puts a price on what we consume (e.g. oil and gas) that causes climate change. It allows us to see that what we are consuming causes climate change and this is what we have to pay in order to fight climate change. The cost is not hidden. It is there for us to see, plus we get carbon tax rebates which are larger, for many of us, than what we pay through the carbon tax. So the carbon tax is not contributing to the affordability situation. A Star letter writer offers other suggestions for the climate fight like planting trees and use of solar panels which are helpful, but this puts the onus on the individual over the government to do the legwork. We all have to fight climate change and that is what the carbon tax does.</p><p><br/><br/> Alberto Sarthou, Toronto<br/><br/> According to the International Energy Agency, vehicles in Canada have the highest average fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per kilometre driven. We developed a wasteful suburban lifestyle. It made economic sense at the time. Despite past misdirection, we must consider the 2023 record forest fire season and accept the science. Global warming is real. Expecting politicians to rein in the collective greed of eight billion people is like asking them to turn off gravity. Austerity is not popular.<br/><br/> A multi-faceted approach to the climate problem is needed. Charging for carbon emission is an essential part. I commend our Liberal government for not kicking this can further down the road. Lower taxes to ease cost of living pain would be a nice Band-Aid. Looking in the mirror and discovering that \"the problem is us\" is a bit harder.<br/><br/> We should do what we can to consume sustainably and pollute less. This includes convincing others, including politicians, that suspending or killing climate solutions is simply burying our heads in the sand.<br/><br/> Dave Ross, Thornhill <br/><br/> The Liberal government  needs to explain why they are doing this. The message is simple: global warming is costing us billions of dollars in damages each year across Canada and it's due to of carbon emissions. The damages are from droughts, wildfires, floods, severe winds and crop failures. If we don't reduce our carbon emissions, these damages will get worse and they will make the Earth an inhospitable place for our children and grandchildren. The carbon tax is intended to motivate us toward these changes and we hope everyone will do their part. It would not be difficult for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to say this but unfortunately there is no one home.<br/><br/> Mike Smith, Oakville <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2024032371002945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BMB-55T1-JDV5-F0RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The present forest fire is a warning of what dire straits we may face at a time when an unexpected natural disaster strikes and we are totally unprepared with no alternative escape route available out of Port Alberni to the other side.</p><p>A sound warning system by itself is not going to save our lives when citizens have to evacuate out of Port Alberni and there is no alternative route to use, such as now.</p><p>This is the time to act before another, perhaps worse, disaster affects the Alberni Valley, when residents need a secondary highway system in place to use as an escape route.</p><p>It\u2019s time that Victoria be made to realize the necessity of another highway route in and out of Port Alberni for the good of all people.</p><p>Vi and Dell McConnell, Port Alberni</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-news20230614PPFA0003652058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G2-6V31-F0HF-81J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.</p><p>You might be interested in</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>{{type}}</p><p>{{title}}</p><p>Dec 31, 1969</p><p>Comments</p><p>Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.</p><p>Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke.

Eleven men are known to have perished and a number are missing in a fire that swept the Spruce river valley, 15 miles northeast of here Saturday afternoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sixty odd men and about 20 teams were trapped in camp 14 of the Elk Lumber Company, which is situated in a blind valley and their flight over the mountains was most difficult.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eleven bodies have been picked up in the rear of the fire and the terrible agony the men endured is shown by their contorted features.</p><p>Nick Muscovich, a Russian, was found alive, his eyes burned sightless and almost demented. His body was severely burned and all his clothing was gone, except his boots, but after being given first aid he recovered and urged the rescuers to leave him and help men he knew to be beyond him. With assistance he walked to the emergency hospital and was later brought to Fernie, where his death is hourly expected.</p><p>Many of those on reaching points of safety were found to be temporarily demented from shock.</p><p>Millions of feet of logs, the logging railroad and the bush camp buildings, together with equipment, horses and supplies are a total loss. Ten fatalities is the lowest estimate.</p><p>The fire is now considered checked by the heavy showers that fell last night, but if the wind rises the blaze will be revived.</p><p>The fire had been burning since Wednesday in the vicinity of the Elk Lumber Company\u2019s camps and after destroying two of the lower camps was Saturday morning, after a twoday fight, well in hand and no further damage was thought probable.</p><p>Within an hour after relaxing their efforts, the almost exhausted fire fighters were required to respond to another alarm, but they were powerless to even approach the fire into which the dying embers of the former fire had been fanned by a hurricane which arose.</p><p>Doctors and relief parties wore dispatched at once to the scene but their efforts were practically unavailing as they were unable to approach to an effective distance the fire zone.</p><p>The escape of the majority of the men was miraculous.</p><p>Elko news \u2026 The forest fires have been very bad south of the town and some started by the Great Northern Trains got very close to town. It is the longest spell ever known around here without rain.and the sheep men west of the town were getting very anxious with fires all around them, but the monotony broke Saturday night when the rain came down in nice big chunks, and the green grass is once more growing all round.</p><p>Notice \u2014 Corporation of the City of Cranbrook:Notice to Users of Water. Owing to the great amount of water now being used throughout the City, due no doubt, to the excessive heat, the water pressure at the hydrants has been con-siderably reduced and users of water are requested to immediately turn off all taps and lawn services upon the Fire Alarm being sounded. Cranbrook, B. C\u201e July 16th 1917. Thos. M. Roberts, City Clerk Narrow escape! \u2026 Mr. Wm. Hamilton, our pioneer fruit rancher had a narrow escape from death last week when he got tangled up in the horns of his prize bull.</p><p>It appears from information received that the bull charged Mr. Hamilton so suddenly that there was no alternative but to grab the bull by the horns, but unfortunately Mr. Hamilton\u2019s hand slipped on one of the horns and he fell prostrate on the bull\u2019s head.</p><p>The enraged animal, who probably thought he was being made the dupe of a toreador\u2019s prank lost no time in tossing his victim high in the air and landing him about twenty feet away. Mr. Hamilton came down on the side of his head and right shoulder and was so seriously injured that he could not move and were it not for the timely arrival of his faithful dog he probably would have been gored to death.</p><p>As it was the dog, by barking and snapping at the enraged beast, kept him away from his master until he had sufficiently escaped to reach a place of safety.</p><p>We are pleased to note that Mr. Hamilton is able to be around in spite of his thrilling experience.</p><p>Whooping cough \u2026 As there are a number of cases of whooping cough in town and in view of the approach of school opening, it is deemed advisable to take some precaution against the spread of the disease. The School Board have therefore procured sufficient quantity of vaccine to inoculate all the school children of Cranbrook.</p><p>Drs. Green and MacKinnon have offered to administer the vaccine treatment between the hours of 9 and 10 a.m. only, free of charge. Two injections at an interval of 4 to 5 days are advised as a preventative. Parents please take notice and present your children at the Doctors\u2019 office to be treated accordingly. H. White, Chairman of School Board.</p><p>A suggestion for a returned soldier\u2019s home \u2026 Dear Sir, At the public meeting called some time ago for the purpose of discussing conscription the time when our men come home was frequently alluded to.</p><p>The question crossed my mind as to what \u201ccoming home\u201d really meant to many of these men. The canopy of heaven and the earth beneath with even an over-powering welcome at the station do not make \u201chome.\u201d</p><p>Cranbrook and the surrounding country has sent a large number in proportion to population. And from where do these men come? The mining and lumber camps, the isolated claim in the hills, and the lonely bachelor homestead have contributed not a few. Many of these men, born with the wandering foot, have lost all connection with their own kin in the east or the old country or at least have lost all sympathy with the more conventional life.</p><p>Right or wrong they will come back to the mountain province. What to do with these men when they return confronts British Columbia to a greater extent than any other province unless it be New Ontario.</p><p>For the very ill there will be hospital service a plenty, and for the semi-invalid the sanitarium; but the man with little education and less money, who has made his living with his hands, where is he to find a home? Would it not be wise to think and prepare for these men in some way that they may keep their sense of independence and as far as possible a wholesome view of life? Could not Cranbrook have something of a home ready for these men when they come? I do not mean a barracks or an \u201cinstitution,\u201d but a headquarters as near a home as it can be made with living well within the veteran\u2019s income.</p><p>One of my earliest recollections is of two old men sitting by the fire swapping stories of 1837. One was my grandfather. Let this home have a large assembly room, with a big open fire, substantial homelike furniture, plenty of books and papers and a gramophone. Though the bedrooms may necessarily be small, but so that any man who needs it may find a place of his very own, at a price well within his means. Let the cuisine be good and homelike and above all provide a tasteful cheerful woman with a knowledge of nursing as Matron.</p><p>Let these men go out and get a week\u2019s work or a month\u2019s work and be encouraged to do so; but there will be times when all of these men will have nerves that will rebel at the outrages they received \u201csomewhere in France.\u201d It is then these must feel that they have some place to go.</p><p>And in a quiet corner of this home, let there be a tablet In memory of those, who directly from France have gone to the \u201cBetter Home.\u201d \u2026 A Canadian Woman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20240730PPZA0004514074</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CKX-65V1-JD2C-J06H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1228\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

They're among the 4,000 around the town of Red Lake told to move further south. John Vennavally-Rao on the mass evacuation.</p><p>JOHN VENNAVALLY-RAO (Reporter): Those still in Red Lake woke up to an ominous haze of smoke this morning, with this out of control fire burning nearby, keeping everyone on edge.</p><p>RYAN KINGSLEY (Red Lake Resident): We're nervous with the town. I know the fire is really close by and the winds are switching directions today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: She is burning everywhere around us, man.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: This was the dramatic scene late Monday as people in the area were first urged to leave, cars backed the up on the road out, with the forest fire potentially threatening homes, though so far none have been destroyed.</p><p>JOHNNY DODIC (Red Lake Resident): Thought they had it under control, and then my son gave me a call and said there might be a possibility we might get evacuated.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: Evacuees heading for communities like Dryden, where some took shelter at a hockey rink, while this lodge, which was closed for the summer because of COVID, opened its doors to take people in.</p><p>TED PUTNAM (Hawk Lake Lodge): I talked to a couple people that slept in their cars that night. One person slept on the side of the road. I mean there's no place to go.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: In Ontario it's been a dry hot summer. More than 15 crews are now battling the flames about three kilometres from Red Lake.</p><p>JONATHAN SCOTT (Fire Information Officer): We also had four crews that are setting up sprinklers on structures in the area to make sure they're safe and protected.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: The Red Lake fire isn't the only problem. Another one burning near Fort Hope, Ontario, has also prompted a First Nations community there to declare a state of emergency. Because of worries about smoke, the first of hundreds of evacuees arrived today in Thunder Bay.</p><p>HARVEY YESNO (Eabametoong First Nation Chief): Our priority where I'm concerned was in regards to people that may have chronic or respiratory, you know, disability issues, elderly.</p><p>VENNAVALLY-RAO: In Red Lake, the evacuation remains voluntary, and some have decided to stay, with firefighters hoping rain in the forecast will help them get the flames under control.

However, with the removal of the Restricted Fire Zone, he said it falls back to the fire department to access local situations. For now, all the restrictions on fires, including campfires remain in place, he stressed.  </p><p>\u201cI am going to take a look at local conditions and make a decision by Thursday morning,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Mayor Jennifer Murphy said she was pleased to see conditions had improved enough for the province to lift the Restricted Fire Zone designation. She pointed out she has been attending meetings about the fire danger conditions and things did not look good.  </p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago, they were talking into August,\u201d she said.  </p><p>Earlier in the meeting, the fire chief had noted although there has been some rain, it has not been enough to saturate the land.  </p><p>\u201cWe have been having rain, but it is so sporadic,\u201d he said. </p><p>He said there is a lot of confusion still about the fire region and the fire ban.  </p><p>Councillor Merv Buckwald said there are signs everywhere, as well as driving into other communities there are many signs about the fire bans in place.  </p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t get the message\u2026,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Chief Wagner said there is no burning allowed of any kind with a Level 2 ban and he will consider moving to a Level One ban but will make that decision carefully in the next few days. </p><p>\u201cDropping down to Level One, would that allow campfires?\u201d asked Coun. Buckwald.  </p><p>\u201cYes, but no burning brush,\u201d the fire chief said.  </p><p>As of press time, BV remained at a Level Two fire ban with no burning allowed of any kind, including campfires.  </p><p>Although the Restricted Fire Zone was lifted, the Forest Fire Information Map for Ontario showed much of Renfrew County in a high forest fire danger rating. The interactive map shows the forest fire danger ratings and locations of fires. As of press time, the southern part of Renfrew County was listed as high danger and the northern part of the county as moderate danger.  </p><p>The Restricted Fire Zone had been in place for the entire fire region of Ontario.  </p><p>\u201cThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry would like to thank Ontarians and visitors for doing their part to help prevent forest fires and keep communities safe,\u201d a release from the MNRF stated. \u201cPlease continue to use extreme caution and follow Ontario\u2019s Outdoor Fires Regulations when having an outdoor fire.\u201d </p><p>The release continued, \u201clifting the RFZ does not mean we can let our guard down when it comes to preventing human-caused fires. We all need to remain vigilant and keep safety top of mind when having outdoor fires.\u201d </p><p>An MNRF Restricted Fire Zone and a municipal fire ban can be in place at the same time or separately, the MNRF noted.  </p><p>\u201cIt is important that the public check with their local municipality as they may have local ire bans or fire restrictions in place,\u201d the release concluded. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-15d547207c7d4abab0ef285d71e24278</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PC-FP81-DY9S-T0Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><timeReceived>03:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 13, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Red Cross will have a team of 100 responders in the N.W.T. working\u00a0on the logistics of evacuating communities and helping them return home.</p><p>St. John Ambulance will draw upon its pool of emergency responders, including nurses, doctors, and paramedics, to\u00a0provide emergency\u00a0health and psychological support services.</p><p>The Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC) told\u00a0CBC\u00a0News the organization will draw upon its member associations across Canada to help support firefighters near the front lines. Search and rescue volunteers will build camps for firefighters, haul\u00a0hoses and transport other gear.</p><p>\"There are so many other roles. If we can help with those roles, then the firefighters who do have the proper training can focus on them,\" said Janelle Coultes, president of SARVAC.</p><p>Sajjan said this wildfire season SARVAC has \"a new mission-ready group\" of about 200 volunteers that will deploy within 72 hours for up to three weeks for emergencies.</p><p>Since the\u00a0Humanitarian Workforce Program was launched\u00a0during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has provided $166.9 million to various organizations that are part of the program, said Joanna Kanga, Sajjan's\u00a0press secretary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NDP calls for permanent solution</emphasis></p><p>NDP\u00a0Leader Jagmeet Singh said small municipalities don't have the capacity to respond to large natural disasters. He called on the government to adopt more permanent solutions.</p><p>\"We have to place the resources to fight the fires ... and then to have the emergency response capacity,\" Singh said. \"And that means having the food, the support, the logistics for communities that are often displaced from their homes.</p><p>\"All this is required, and I think we are past the stage of having a pilot project. We need to have a real plan in place for what might be another record-breaking forest fire season.\"</p><p>Western Canada and the North are expected to face an above-average fire risk in June, federal officials said Thursday.</p><p>While British Columbia and Alberta experienced favourable spring conditions that led to fewer wildfires and evacuations, federal officials warned the situation could change rapidly.</p><p>They added that the wildfire outlook is expected to worsen in the summer, driven by warm temperatures and drought conditions. The 2023 wildfire season\u00a0broke records for the amount of land burned.</p><p>That year, the military also hit a record for consecutive days on\u00a0operations supporting civilian authorities - 141 in a row.</p><p>The military's top operations commander, Vice-Admiral Bob Auchterlonie, has warned that the Armed Forces\u00a0is being used too often in response to\u00a0weather and wildfire crises.</p><p>Auchterlonie oversees the Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC), which handles all domestic and foreign deployments of troops.</p><p>In December, he told CBC that he\u00a0tells provincial emergency measures organizations and federal agencies that the military should not be the first option for responding to natural disasters.</p><p>\"I reinforce the message and say we are a force of last resort, [and] this is what we can provide, if necessary, in extremis,\" Auchterlonie said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewspoliticswildfiresclimatemilitarycanada17200878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0T-P951-F03F-K00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

It may save a few dollars now but it will cause additional work in the future, at greater expense. It is suggested those opposed to the project get with the agenda, which is building this city so it is ready for the future.</p><p>A city with 200 vehicles needs a 10-bay garage. You don't want fire trucks and snowplows waiting to be repaired due to a lack of bays. At the rate Nanaimo is growing, it is going to have to build for the future. If Nanaimo built the garage with fewer bays, in a few years it would be building an addition, if there was room. Building it now will be less expensive. At the rate new subdivisions are being built along with apartment buildings, Nanaimo will require its facilities to keep up. Nanaimo is up to the challenge. However, the support services need to be there. We need to keep in mind climate change will most likely provide new challenges. We don't want a forest fire around the city, and having two fire trucks waiting for repairs because the garage at the works yard isn't big enough.</p><p>Having lived in Greater Vancouver from 1951 until 2000, there was immense growth in all the cities in the area. It's a good thing someone set aside land for work yards. Let's hope Nanaimo does the same. Buying land today and into the future is going to be a very expensive endeavour.</p><p>E.A.

However, it is also an anomaly on the list because it is run by a joint, six-member commission of Americans and Canadian officials, and funded by Washington and Ottawa. </p><p>One mayor said it was time for the provincial government to market the area the same way it was celebrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, before air conditioning was widely used and hordes of wealthy Americans travelled up to beat the heat in the sweltering summers. </p><p>\u201cThis is just my opinion, but climate change could help our area,\u201d said James Bedford, the mayor of Fundy-St. Martins, when asked what could help increase traffic to his coastal community, which includes the Fundy Trail. </p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re inland and it hits 37 or 40 degrees Celsius, and you come down along the coast, it\u2019s about 10 degrees cooler. So that could drive a lot of people into our area. I noticed that\u2019s a big thing. People want to come down on the beach to get cooler. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve even had people say, \u2018we appreciate the fog.\u2019 As locals we don\u2019t like the fog and we take it for granted, but others say, \u2018no, we like this, it\u2019s cool air.\u2019\u201d </p><p>Brunswick News contacted the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture to speak to minister Tammy Scott-Wallace, but a spokeswoman said she was unavailable. </p><p>Bedford said tourism operators in St. Martins had noticed a slow start to this year\u2019s season, but the campgrounds are beginning to fill up and lines for lobster rolls are getting longer.  </p><p>He\u2019s also hopeful the Fundy Trail will see more traffic. This is the first time in 26 years the trail and parkway, with its stunning vistas, steep trails and pristine beaches, is being run as a provincial park, after the Fundy Trail Authority relinquished control last December. </p><p>Few operators are reporting as good business as pre-pandemic, with 2019 a banner year, followed by the 2020 bust and the slow crawl out of the health and travel restrictions that made vacationing difficult. </p><p>Jordan Jamison, president of the St. Martins and District Chamber of Commerce, believes there are some low-hanging fruit that\u2019s ripe for the picking. </p><p>\u201cFor instance, the Fundy Trail is now a provincial park. And that\u2019s great. But if you go to Alma, on the eastern side, there are no signs encouraging you to go to St. Martins. The village as a whole sees a third of the visitors that Fundy National Park gets, just on the other side of the parkway. Only one third. How is that possible, if Fundy and the parkway are such a huge draw, with St. Martins on the other end? We need to market better.\u201d </p><p>Jamison has run Bay of Fundy Adventures, a kayaking and hiking firm, and Shipyard Caf\u00e9 in the heart of the village for a decade. He said his business went way down last year, but he blamed much of it on the weather. As much of the rest of Canada burned \u2013 the country suffered its worst forest fire season ever, with smoke and poor air quality in many places a big health hazard \u2013 New Brunswick had a lot of rain in 2023. </p><p>That\u2019s reflected in the numbers for the top indoor attraction, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, which had the biggest increase in visitors last year, 12,862, a hike of nearly 50 per cent over 2022. </p><p>\u201cLast year we didn\u2019t have a nice weekend till the first weekend of August,\u201d Jamison said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t buy a nice day out here. And people just weren\u2019t as interested in going outdoors. Our numbers plummeted.\u201d </p><p>The good part is his pre-season bookings this year were higher than ever, and he\u2019s confident business will be on the upswing. </p><p>He said the provincial government should continue in its marketing to focus on local operators that can offer visitors special experiences, not just take them to see sites. </p><p>\u201cWe have tons of stories to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe province is doing better with this, but it could be improved. And we\u2019re happy to help them, if they\u2019re willing to help us.\u201d </p><p>Annick Robichaud Butland, co-president of the Albert County Chamber of Commerce, said the drop in numbers at Hopewell Rocks couldn\u2019t just be dismissed as weather-related. As the former group tour manager at the iconic site on the Bay of Fundy, she knows that about seven out of every 10 of its visitors are from outside the Maritimes, including visitors from Europe and Asia. </p><p>She, like Jamison, recommended the provincial government keep focusing on experiential visits in its marketing, including catering to visitors who want to lessen their environmental footprint and support small, local businesses. </p><p>\u201cAlbert County offers that tenfold. If you want to have lobster on the beach, you can. If you want to talk to a local artist and see pottery in their shop, you can.\u201d </p><p>Working in tourism for close to two decades \u2013 including stints as managing director of Cape Enrage and an employee at Fundy Park \u2013 Robichaud Butland now runs ABConnect Travel, offering specialized, custom tours all over the Maritimes for individuals, families and groups. </p><p>\u201cThe province needs to listen to community sentiment. I lived in Hopewell Cape for six years, so I know what it\u2019s like to be stuck behind a motorhome convoy,\u201d she said, laughing. </p><p>Parking, good roads, and preserving historic features in local communities is important, she said. And she also cautioned the province not to put its eggs all in one basket. Hopewell Rocks, for instance, has a capacity of about 300,000 visitors a year. Any more, she said, and it will become an unfun experience for many. </p><p>If anyone can survive in tourism, she can.

Entire neighbourhoods have been working together to implement the best practices. One of them in Quesnel, South Hills, is a fully recognized FireSmart BC neighbourhood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But even a single home can be protected, or be the buffer needed to slow a large fire down as it threatens many. North Cariboo FireSmart coordinator Ted Traer said the results have been proven, in this area, after so many wildfire incidents in recent years.</p><p>He said the best way to approach wildfire risk reduction around your home is to measure out circles, starting with the zone from your outer walls to the 1.5 metre mark (five feet). Make sure there's nothing combustable in that zone, all the way around. No decorative cedar shrubs, no bark mulch, no woodpiles, no wooden garden gnomes, no hemp doormats, unless they can be swiftly removed. (But what if you're not at home when the fire breaks out?)</p><p>\"Most homes ignite from flying embers landing on a combustible fuel source,\" he said. \"This zone should be composed of dirt, rock, gravel, concrete or asphalt, as this is where the majority of embers would land in close proximity to a structure.\"</p><p>The next circular zone would extend from there out to the 10-metre mark (33 feet).</p><p>\"In this area no trees are recommended as they can be highly combustible and can cause ignition to our homes,\" said Traer. Watch out for combustible lawn furniture, propane tanks, etc. in this wider zone. And watch out for fire fuel in doorway alcoves, carports, decks, roofline intersections, buildup inside eaves troughs, and other points where the blizzard of embers might blow.</p><p>There are many plants that resist fire that can be used for visual personality, so it doesn't have to be a barren landscape.</p><p>Once past that zone, that's where the pruning and planting can be done strategically. Placing deciduous trees is one of the better landscaping choices. And creating a non-flammable understory is another strong suggestion.</p><p>\"Trees are not recommended within the first 10 metres around our homes and structures, but beyond that distance are actually recommended,\" Traer said. \"In this zone they should be spaced out so that there is at least three metres (10 feet) between crowns. They should also be pruned up to remove the ladder fuels at least two metres (seven feet). Cleanup of tree debris should be done on an annual basis. The concept here is you want to remove the ladder fuels where a ground fire could easily climb into the crowns of trees and spread to adjacent stems.\"</p><p>It can be a lot of work to chop, rake, saw, prune, haul, redesign and maintain your property for fire risk reduction, and it might greatly change the landscaping vision you once had for your place, but the benefits are well documented.</p><p>\"It has been determined that if you address the combustible materials within the 10 metres around your home or structure, that you will have a 90 per cent probability of that structure still standing in the event of a wildfire,\" Traer said.</p><p>You can have your property assessed by a FireSmart representative like Traer, and there is ample online information to guide your own efforts. To find out more, said Traer, \"Start first by checking out the FireSmart BC website. There are masses of information on this site including information on how to reduce the fuels around your home and its risk to ignition from wildfire.\"</p><p>Go to firesmartbc.ca and go exploring the information.

The site is far from the nearest homes and no one had to be evacuated, but authorities declared a 1,000-meter (more than half-mile) exclusion zone and a nearby highway and railway line remained closed on Friday.</p><p>Fire service spokesman Thomas Kirstein said that wildfires in the area around the ammunition dump had been largely extinguished by Friday morning. Authorities are now hoping to get a close look at the site itself, with help from armored vehicles and robots, after being unable to do so on Thursday amid concern about continuing sporadic detonations. </p><p>It remains unclear what triggered the first explosions at the ammunition dump early Thursday. The site was created in Cold War-era West Berlin in 1950, and 25 metric tons or more of fireworks, World War II ammunition and other explosive ordnance was stored there before the fire started. Controlled blasts are carried out there twice a year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ea49809d8bd2b15c07211f32fa342d51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6637-F2F1-DY9S-T34S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"207\"/><timeReceived>03:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 5, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Berlin</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Berlin</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp; ARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A4QF</classCode><className>COLD WAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000195</classCode><className>BOMBS &amp; EXPLOSIVE DEVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DGXY</classCode><className>ARTILLERY &amp; ORDNANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DGXY</classCode><className>ARTILLERY &amp; ORDNANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GX121</classCode><className>BERLIN, GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In the latest attempt to axe the tax, Conservatives are proposing a summer gas tax exemption to help Canadians struggling with high costs.<br/><br/>PIERRE POILIEVRE (LEADER OF THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION):<br/>An end to gas and diesel taxes from Victoria Day 'til Labour Day to give Canadians a summer break.</p><p><br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>The response from the Prime Minister?<br/><br/>JUSTIN TRUDEAU (PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA):<br/>He would rather watch the country burn and Canadians suffer than continue to fight against climate change.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>So is the Conservative leader's proposal a real thing, and what do we make of the Prime Minister's response? Let's bring everybody back. Chantal, Althia, and Aaron in for Andrew Coyne. Althia, why don't you start us off on this? I mean, I, I think this is probably dead on arrival because the carbon tax is caught up in it and it seems like this is also something the provinces could do with the exception of the carbon tax, but, but tell me why you think Pierre Poilievre's doing it and what you made of the Prime Minister's response.<br/><br/>ALTHIA RAJ (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Well, in the same way that the Liberals want us to talk about capital gains and taxing the rich, Mr. Poilievre wants us to keep talking about axing the tax or axing taxes as the case may be. It's a new, new lipstick on basically the same poster, and it's working, right? Because again we are talking about it. Is it likely to happen? No. But it does put a bit of an asterisk on this idea. Is this something that we would find in a Conservative platform, for example, and then what would that mean, what would the fallout of not having those revenues mean for municipal infrastructure funding or, well, other areas where that money goes? I think what was notable for me, and you played that clip for the Prime Minister, was both the level of rhetoric from the opposition, the opposition leader and the Prime Minister on this. I mean, Mr. Poilievre in his press conference came out and said really ridiculous things about the Prime Minister, how he wanted workers out of a job and the Prime Minister countered with heated rhetoric in the same, in the same spaces. I don't know how long we're going to sustain this if the campaign is only in October 2025 because it seems like they're itching to go at it right now. Yeah.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Chantal?<br/><br/>CHANTAL H\u00c9BERT (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yes, they're, they're itching to go at it by saying things that are in the case of the Prime Minister today outlandish as in watching Canada burn rather than have a carbon tax. Well, there is a link between one and the other, but it's not the link that he's making.<br/><br/>ALTHIA RAJ (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>I think it's even worse than that, he said, he said watch the country burn and Canadians suffer. That's what the Conservative leader apparently wants to see.<br/><br/>CHANTAL H\u00c9BERT (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yeah. I read, I read the, the transcript from that news conference. It wasn't just on carbon pricing and watching the country burn. He found a way, Justin Trudeau, to go to abortion rights and Roe v. Wade coming to this country. I'm not sure he can keep up that pitch and, and sound reasonable. As for Mr. Poilievre's proposal, yes, it is dead on arrival, but it is a way to keep the conversation going until April 1st when the carbon tax was supposed to go up, that was the narrative. April 1st is behind us, and the carbon tax is still where it was supposed to be, so that is a new narrative that takes him to Labour Day with something to say about something that he, one, will not get and two, doesn't really want to get.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>I take your point about what the Prime Minister said, but I would also make the point that Pierre Poilievre was making these comments in British Columbia, a province that is dealing with forest fires, and, and whether or not carbon pricing solves climate change, yes.<br/><br/>CHANTAL H\u00c9BERT (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yes, but it doesn't stop a single forest fire, let's be serious. I'm a climate person, I try to be serious about it, so how much you pay for gas is not going to make an inch of difference to a forest fire in BC today, tomorrow, or next month.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Sure, but, but he also didn't talk about the forest fires at that press conference, which I found maybe a little remarkable. Aaron, you weigh in though.<br/><br/>AARON WHERRY (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yeah. I mean, I think if, if Mr. Poilievre is seriously concerned about affordability then cutting the gas tax is actually a better idea than cutting the carbon tax, which has a rebate, the gas tax does not have a rebate. Of course, the reason that he's, you know, maybe focused on the carbon tax and not on the gas tax is because the gas tax provides revenue that can then be sent to cities and provinces for infrastructure. But in terms of affordability, the gas tax cut makes a lot more sense. As for the rest of his argument, I mean, his, his central argument was that the government should do these things because Canadians want to be able to go to summer vacations and he, he talked wistfully about going camping in British Columbia. And I dare say that the biggest threat to people going camping in, in British Columbia and other places this summer is not the carbon tax, it's the wildfires. And, you know, yes, we can argue about whether or not carbon taxes on their own are going to solve the climate crisis, but it is, we are kind of getting into a, I think a weird place if, if the leader of the opposition, of the Conservative Party, is sort of loathed of hesitant to discuss the fact that wildfires are going on because of the climate conversation. And again, you know, I'm repeating myself now probably ad nauseam, but we're about to go into another summer where there are wildfires all over, all over Canada, and we're not having a serious debate about climate policy, and because we're not having a serious debate about climate policy, we're not going to have a serious discussion about adaptation and, and how to deal with wildfires. And so, you know, yes, the Prime Minister's comments, he overreached rhetorically, but there is something to be said for the fact that, you know, if you're in BC and you're talking about going camping, how does that square with the fact that, you know, parts of the province are, are on fire at the moment?<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Chantal\u2026<br/><br/>ALTHIA RAJ (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yeah, but I don't\u2026<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Chantal, then Althia? Yeah.<br/><br/>CHANTAL H\u00c9BERT (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>I don't think we've had a serious conversation about climate policy for a long, long time.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Yeah, I think we would all agree with that.<br/><br/>CHANTAL H\u00c9BERT (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>So I'm not going to hold my breath for it to happen this summer, but I also think that the danger of the Prime Minister going over the top with this rhetoric is that it becomes, the expression in French is (speaking French) or something like that. If you exaggerate, in the end, you're not even in the conversation, and when I watch what I watched today, I find that the Liberals are joining the Conservatives and bailing out of the serious conversation.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Althia?<br/><br/>ALTHIA RAJ (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yeah, I don't disagree with that. I don't think this was a message that was necessarily directed at British Columbia. Mr. Poilievre has been on the campaign trail, whether or not you want to describe it as a permanent campaign for two years now. You know, he started off his press conference with like eight minutes or something of French. He is mostly talking to people who use their cars, whether or not they're Albertans going to British Columbia to camp for the summer. He's talking about people who live in the GTA who drive into work, who spend a lot of time in their vehicles. People in more rural areas who use their cars and for whom, going to the pumps every few days is a bit of a grimacing incident because you don't know how much more you'll be forced to pay. So, that's who this is directed to. It's not necessarily a pitch to a specific group of people that he was meeting with or the reporters that he was talking to earlier this morning.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Aaron, last word to you.<br/><br/>AARON WHERRY (AT ISSUE PANELIST):<br/>Yeah, to Chantal's point, I think she's right. You know, if you try to fight fire with fire, you may risk getting burned yourself, and I think the Liberals have to be careful in that respect. On the flip side of it is, it will be another frustrating summer if we continue to just be unable to have a conversation about climate policy and what we're going to do about it. You know, I just don't know that that ages well and I don't know that that looks like a Parliament that is in touch with what's actually going on in the country. If, you know, wildfires are going on, but the conversation remains as stilted and sort of half-baked as it is.<br/><br/>ROSEMARY BARTON (REPORTER):<br/>Okay, we got to leave it there. Thank you all for that. Aaron, thank you for being here, and with that I'll send things back to Asha and she's in Toronto.<br/><br/>ASHA TOMLINSON (CBC-TV):<br/>Thanks, Rosie.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-NA24051619</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C22-P411-F0BD-C00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1530\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

An evacuation order has been issued by the Plumas County Sheriff's Office and all US Copper staff and contractors have been demobilized from the project and are safe and accounted for. At this point, there has been no damage to the infrastructure at the Superior drill site. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and will provide timely updates on any material developments to the situation. To date, 7 drill holes have been completed, which will provide considerable data relative to the objectives of the drill program. When conditions permit, the Company will review the options for further drilling at that time. <br/>Further information on the fire can be found online using \"Dixie Fire update\" as a search item. <br/>About US Copper Corp<br/>US Copper controls approximately 13 square miles of patented and unpatented federal mining claims in the Light's CreekCopper District in Plumas County, NECalifornia; essentially, the entire District. The District contains substantial copper (silver) sulfide and copper oxide resources in three deposits - Moonlight, Superior and Engels, as well as several partially tested and untested exploration targets.  <br/>The Superior and Engels Mines operated from about 1915-1930 producing over 161 million pounds of copper from over 4 million tons of rock containing 2.2% copper with silver and gold credits.  <br/>The Moonlight Deposit was discovered and drilled by Placer Amex during the 1960's.

That\u2019s a big jump from Thursday, when the agency reported 209 fires, with 87 out of control.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Friday that cooler weather is expected in Western Canada and rain in Nova Scotia, which will help. But the severe fire warnings are likely to continue in most provinces for another four to five weeks at least.</p><p>\u201cThe situation remains severe across the country,\u201d Blair said. \u201cWe are hopeful that the improving weather conditions and that rain will assist in the firefighting efforts, but there\u2019s still a great deal of work that needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>More than 27,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada over the last two months, more than 10 times the average amount of land burned by fires over the last decade.</p><p>Thus far, more than 96 per cent of the burned land was in Western Canada and Northwest Territories, but last weekend the situation became more severe in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and now parts of Ontario and Quebec are also burning.</p><p>\u201cThere are a number of very significant \u2014 over 100 wildfires \u2014 that have now popped up in Quebec and some of them are out of control and quite serious,\u201d said Blair. The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre database added 113 fires in Quebec since Thursday, and 76 of them are classified as being out of control.</p><p>The Canadian Armed Forces deployed several hundred troops to Alberta to help in May and is training more to help in Nova Scotia now, said Blair. The military and the Canadian Coast Guard is also helping with equipment, he said.</p><p>The number of fires, their size and severity, as well as the number of places affected are straining Canada\u2019s resources, so the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre has requested help from international partners.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230603RDA0003624659</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CM-6P71-F0HF-83Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Entire neighbourhoods have been working together to implement the best practices. One of them in Quesnel, South Hills, is a fully recognized FireSmart BC neighbourhood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But even a single home can be protected, or be the buffer needed to slow a large fire down as it threatens many. North Cariboo FireSmart coordinator Ted Traer said the results have been proven, in this area, after so many wildfire incidents in recent years.</p><p>He said the best way to approach wildfire risk reduction around your home is to measure out circles, starting with the zone from your outer walls to the 1.5 metre mark (five feet). Make sure there\u2019s Continued on Page A2 nothing combustable in that zone, all the way around. No decorative cedar shrubs, no bark mulch, no woodpiles, no wooden garden gnomes, no hemp doormats, unless they can be swiftly removed. (But what if you\u2019re not at home when the fire breaks out?) \u201cMost homes ignite from flying embers landing on a combustible fuel source,\u201d he said. \u201cThis zone should be composed of dirt, rock, gravel, concrete or asphalt, as this is where the majority of embers would land in close proximity to a structure.\u201d</p><p>The next circular zone would extend from there out to the 10-metre mark (33 feet). \u201cIn this area no trees are recommended as they can be highly combustible and can cause ignition to our homes,\u201d said Traer. Watch out for com-bustible lawn furniture, propane tanks, etc.in this wider zone. And watch out for fire fuel in doorway alcoves, carports, decks, roofline intersections, buildup inside eaves troughs, and other points where the blizzard of embers might blow.</p><p>There are many plants that resist fire that can be used for visual personality, so it doesn\u2019t have to be a barren landscape.</p><p>Once past that zone, that\u2019s where the pruning and planting can be done strategically. Placing deciduous trees is one of the better landscaping choices. And creating a non-flammable understory is another strong suggestion.</p><p>\u201cTrees are not recommended within the first 10 metres around our homes and structures, but beyond that distance are actually recommended,\u201d Traer said. \u201cIn this zone they should be spaced out so that there is at least three metres (10 feet) between crowns. They should also be pruned up to remove the ladder fuels at least two metres (seven feet). Cleanup of tree debris should be done on an annual basis. The concept here is you want to remove the ladder fuels where a ground fire could easily climb into the crowns of trees and spread to adjacent stems.\u201d</p><p>It can be a lot of work to chop, rake, saw, prune, haul, redesign and maintain your property for fire risk reduction, and it might greatly change the landscaping vision you once had for your place, but the benefits are well documented.</p><p>\u201cIt has been determined that if you address the combustible materials within the 10 metres around your home or structure, that you will have a 90 per cent probability of that structure still standing in the event of a wildfire,\u201d Traer said.</p><p>You can have your property assessed by a FireSmart representative like Traer, and there is ample online information to guide your own efforts. To find out more, said Traer, \u201cStart first by checking out the FireSmart BC website. There are masses of information on this site including information on how to reduce the fuels around your home and its risk to ignition from wildfire.\u201d</p><p>Go to firesmartbc.ca and go exploring the information.

The rules change the current annually allowed amount from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-strengthen-air-quality-standards-protect-public-harmful-effects-soot\">12 micrograms per cubic meter of air to 9 micrograms per cubic meter of air</url> . The concern is with particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (or the equivalent aerodynamic diameter).</p><p>The EPA indicates that this change has a potential public health benefit, preventing 4,500 premature deaths annually, saving 290,000 lost workdays and saving as much as $46 billion in net health benefits.</p><p>Does this go far enough? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/WHO-Air-Quality-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=By%20reducing%20air%20pollution%20levels,3%20%2D%204%20days%20per%20year.\">The World Health Organization has a guideline</url>  level for fine particulate matter of only 5 micrograms per cubic meter, almost twice as stringent as the EPA's new standard. It should also be noted that the change will not be instant and the EPA has presented a schedule giving about eight years to reach the standard, making it vulnerable to a U-turn should Donald Trump win the forthcoming general election.</p><p>Hence, how strong is the EPA claim? University of Michigan researcher <url normalizedValue=\"https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/batterman-stuart.html\">Stuart Batterman</url> , professor of environmental science and global public health at the School of Public Health, has been studying the impacts of the environment on health, including air pollution control engineering, air quality monitoring, indoor air quality, exposure assessment and environmental epidemiology.</p><p>Batterman broadly welcomes the position taken by the EPA, stating: 'This is good news. Achieving the new standard will save thousands of lives each year. The EPA has been regulating levels of airborne particulate matter since 1971 and we've seen some striking changes over this time.'</p><p>Drawing out some of these research findings, Batterman notes: 'The scientific evidence shows that health impacts occur at lower and lower levels, and thus the EPA has changed the level and form of the standards some half-dozen times.'</p><p>Batterman also observes there have been some 'significant advances in understanding the diverse impacts caused by exposure. Particulate matter not only causes cardiovascular and respiratory illness, but it also increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few.'</p><p>\u00a0Batterman notes there remains more to do be done in order to improve air pollution. He states: 'As old so-called legacy pollution sources like coal-fired power plants are phased out and as forest fire smoke increases, the chemical composition of contributing sources and even the toxicity of this pollutant is shifting. The new standard is helpful, but it's not going to be the final word.'</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/epas-new-air-pollution-rules-will-they-promote-a-cleaner-environment-in-the-us/article\">EPA's new air pollution rules: Will they promote a cleaner environment in the US?</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">Digital Journal</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/epas-new-air-pollution-rules-will-they-promote-a-cleaner-environment-in-the-us/article\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDJ-DIJO100903170941838914325976100026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BFX-G8D1-F03R-N4C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><timeReceived>9:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Newstex LLC</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2024 Digital Journal</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 2, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Global</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Tech &amp;

Hornick.' </p><p>Heavy workloads and low recognition are causing unrest within the guild. </p><p>WHAT ARE THE FIREFIGHTERS' MAIN CONCERNS? </p><p>There are many concerns at this time from the firefighters. However, personnel retention is a significant challenge. </p><p>\"We were having trouble keeping people because the money is not  enough. You can make more money almost anywhere,\" said Freedman. \"Thirty  years ago, you had a crew of four people, and each person on the crew  had at least 20 years of experience.\" </p><p>Economic incentives are not good enough to retain the most experienced personnel, who are essential to guiding new staff. </p><p>\"Your average fire crew today has less than eight years of  experience. We are sending young people under the age of 25, with maybe  five years of experience, to lead fire crews into brand new fires in the  middle of nowhere,\" he said. \"These young firefighters are tasked with  fighting fires and doing it safely. It is a life-and-death situation.\" </p><p>MNRF spokesperson Marcela Mayo said the ministry is working to promote retention. </p><p>\u201cLike many other employers across the province, MNRF has positions  that are being impacted by a highly competitive labour market and  economic factors,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough wildland firefighter positions  are often seasonal or fixed term, with natural attrition occurring as  the fire season winds down, the ministry has hired a consultant to  collaborate with Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services on short  and long-term strategies to improve recruitment and retention.\u201d </p><p>The other concern lies in the budget. </p><p>The ministry has increased its Emergency Fire Fighting funding by more than 92 per cent since 2018, Mayo said. </p><p>Freedman said that increase is not always enough. </p><p>\"If fires must be fought in an emergency, the government will always  spend more money. The problem is that our actual budget is so low that  it is impossible to buy things very quickly,\" he said. \"Because most of  our budget only becomes available when fires start, we can't buy the  necessary equipment and infrastructure that we need before we need it.\" </p><p>WHAT ARE THE REQUESTS TO THE MINISTRY? </p><p> The first request is about standby time. </p><p>\"We are supposed to be entitled to stand by time, which means that  when we're not actively fighting the fire, we're supposed to get paid,\"  said Freedman. \" Sometimes, we are not actively fighting a fire, but we  are sleeping in a tent in the forest, getting eaten by bugs and away  from family or friends, but not getting paid.\" </p><p>The second request is about job titles. </p><p>\"My official job title is 'resource technician three', even though  I'm a fire crew leader,\" he said. \"All we ask is to give the green light  to approve the reclassification of your job codes.\" </p><p>Freedman said the reclassification of the titles will allow a more accurate payment.  </p><p>Despite the problems, Mayo said the ministry committed to working  with OPSEU to review concerns. In addition, she says the ministry's  efforts are reflected locally. </p><p>\u201cAs of August 30, the Parry Sound District has seen a total of 11  fires. There have been no fires of note, with none of the 11 fires  exceeding six hectares in size. There hasn\u2019t been a fire in the district  since late June,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a testament to the hard work and  efforts done by our wildland firefighters, operations staff, pilots and  aviation maintenance engineers, and everyone that has contributed to  these efforts.\u201d </p><p> Julian Orlando Chaves  is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the  Huntsville Forester.

(CSE: SEAG) (OTC Pink: SEHKF) (\" Seahawk\") is pleased to inform all our stakeholders that with the sharp rise in the gold price in the recent couple of months, the corporation is renewing its efforts to arraign and complete an exploration program on our two exploration properties in the Quevillon-Windfall area of north-western Quebec.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Blitz property located approximately 30 km of Quevillon, Quebec, has seen very little modern exploration work on it, with the last drilling completed in 2019 which recovered a 4.4 meter mineralized section of 1.1 g/t Au in hole BE-19-01.</p><p>The Touchdown Property is located approximately 30 Km east-south-east of the currently being developed Windfall Lake Property of Osisko Mining Inc. and Goldfields Ltd. The best results of the 2019 exploration drill program were 5.2 g/t Au over 4.1 meters (including narrow higher-grade sections) and 13.32 g/t Au over 12.6 meters from hole TD-19-01.</p><p>Recently, Seahawk has engaged ALS GoldSpot Discoveries Ltd. to review and propose the next work program for these properties. GoldSpot completed the work early in 2024 and Seahawk is currently formulating a new exploration program considering market conditions, the weather forecast (dry weather/forest fire occurrences restricts our access to the properties) and manpower availability.</p><p>It is projected that a drill program on the Blitz Property will be the first evaluation work when all conditions are met to move forward.</p><p>New Director</p><p>Seahawk Gold Corp. is pleased to announce the appointment of Richard L. Tremblay to the board of directors. Richard brings over 25 years of knowledge and experience in the resource business. He has served on both private and public companies in numerous roles from consulting to corporate development. More recently Richard has served as corporate development of Temas Resources, and in 2022, he served as CEO and director of Allied Copper Corp.</p><p>About Seahawk Gold Corp.</p><p>Seahawk Gold Corp. is a publicly traded Canadian resource exploration company trading in Canada (CSE: SEAG), the U.S. (OTC Pink: SEHKF). Seahawk is the 100% owner four properties along the Urban-Barry Greenstone Belt in the Abitibi sub province of mining friendly Quebec, Canada.</p><p>For further information please contact Seahawk Gold Corp. - <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/DZoQeubMjV\">seahawkgoldcorp.com</url></p><p>Giovanni Gasbarro</p><p>CEO and Director at 1-604-939-1848\u00a0</p><p>Mitchell E.

(\"Seahawk\") is pleased to inform all our stakeholders that with the sharp rise in the gold price in the recent couple of months, the corporation is renewing its efforts to arraign and complete an exploration program on our two exploration properties in the Quevillon-Windfall area of north-western Quebec.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Blitz property located approximately 30 km of Quevillon, Quebec, has seen very little modern exploration work on it, with the last drilling completed in 2019 which recovered a 4.4 meter mineralized section of 1.1 g/t Au in hole BE-19-01.</p><p>The Touchdown Property is located approximately 30 Km east-south-east of the currently being developed Windfall Lake Property of Osisko Mining Inc. and Goldfields Ltd. The best results of the 2019 exploration drill program were 5.2 g/t Au over 4.1 meters (including narrow higher-grade sections) and 13.32 g/t Au over 12.6 meters from hole TD-19-01.</p><p>Recently, Seahawk has engaged ALS GoldSpot Discoveries Ltd. to review and propose the next work program for these properties. GoldSpot completed the work early in 2024 and Seahawk is currently formulating a new exploration program considering market conditions, the weather forecast (dry weather/forest fire occurrences restricts our access to the properties) and manpower availability.</p><p>It is projected that a drill program on the Blitz Property will be the first evaluation work when all conditions are met to move forward.</p><p>New Director</p><p>Seahawk Gold Corp. is pleased to announce the appointment of Richard L. Tremblay to the board of directors. Richard brings over 25 years of knowledge and experience in the resource business. He has served on both private and public companies in numerous roles from consulting to corporate development. More recently Richard has served as corporate development of Temas Resources, and in 2022, he served as CEO and director of Allied Copper Corp.</p><p>About Seahawk Gold Corp.</p><p>Seahawk Gold Corp. is a publicly traded Canadian resource exploration company trading in Canada (CSE: SEAG), the U.S. (OTC Pink: SEHKF). Seahawk is the 100% owner four properties along the Urban-Barry Greenstone Belt in the Abitibi sub province of mining friendly Quebec, Canada.</p><p>For further information please contact Seahawk Gold Corp. - seahawkgoldcorp.com</p><p>Giovanni Gasbarro</p><p>CEO and Director at 1-604-939-1848</p><p>Mitchell E.

Hornick.'<br/><br/> Heavy workloads and low recognition are causing unrest within the guild.<br/><br/> WHAT ARE THE FIREFIGHTERS' MAIN CONCERNS?<br/><br/> There are many concerns at this time from the firefighters. However, personnel retention is a significant challenge.<br/><br/> \"We were having trouble keeping people because the money is not enough. You can make more money almost anywhere,\" said Freedman. \"Thirty years ago, you had a crew of four people, and each person on the crew had at least 20 years of experience.\"<br/><br/> Economic incentives are not good enough to retain the most experienced personnel, who are essential to guiding new staff.<br/><br/> \"Your average fire crew today has less than eight years of experience. We are sending young people under the age of 25, with maybe five years of experience, to lead fire crews into brand new fires in the middle of nowhere,\" he said. \"These young firefighters are tasked with fighting fires and doing it safely. It is a life-and-death situation.\"<br/><br/> MNRF spokesperson Marcela Mayo said the ministry is working to promote retention.<br/><br/> \"Like many other employers across the province, MNRF has positions that are being impacted by a highly competitive labour market and economic factors,\" she said. \"Although wildland firefighter positions are often seasonal or fixed term, with natural attrition occurring as the fire season winds down, the ministry has hired a consultant to collaborate with Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services on short and long-term strategies to improve recruitment and retention.\"<br/><br/> The other concern lies in the budget.<br/><br/> The ministry has increased its Emergency Fire Fighting funding by more than 92 per cent since 2018, Mayo said.<br/><br/> Freedman said that increase is not always enough.<br/><br/> \"If fires must be fought in an emergency, the government will always spend more money. The problem is that our actual budget is so low that it is impossible to buy things very quickly,\" he said. \"Because most of our budget only becomes available when fires start, we can't buy the necessary equipment and infrastructure that we need before we need it.\"<br/><br/> WHAT ARE THE REQUESTS TO THE MINISTRY?<br/><br/> The first request is about standby time.<br/><br/> \"We are supposed to be entitled to stand by time, which means that when we're not actively fighting the fire, we're supposed to get paid,\" said Freedman. \" Sometimes, we are not actively fighting a fire, but we are sleeping in a tent in the forest, getting eaten by bugs and away from family or friends, but not getting paid.\"<br/><br/> The second request is about job titles.<br/><br/> \"My official job title is 'resource technician three', even though I'm a fire crew leader,\" he said. \"All we ask is to give the green light to approve the reclassification of your job codes.\"<br/><br/> Freedman said the reclassification of the titles will allow a more accurate payment.<br/><br/> Despite the problems, Mayo said the ministry committed to working with OPSEU to review concerns. In addition, she says the ministry's efforts are reflected locally.<br/><br/> \"As of August 30, the Parry Sound District has seen a total of 11 fires. There have been no fires of note, with none of the 11 fires exceeding six hectares in size. There hasn't been a fire in the district since late June,\" she said. \"This is a testament to the hard work and efforts done by our wildland firefighters, operations staff, pilots and aviation maintenance engineers, and everyone that has contributed to these efforts.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023090168924866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69C9-8821-JDV5-F4HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.
