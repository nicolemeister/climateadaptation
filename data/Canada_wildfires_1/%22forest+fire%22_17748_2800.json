Across Canada, several provinces and territories are experiencing a severe wildfire season, and the effects are already widespread. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting communities affected by wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources; the Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness; the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services; the Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance; and the Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, provided an update on the actions that the Government of Canada has taken so far to support communities impacted and threatened by wildfires and how it will continue to support Canadians through this year's fire season and future seasons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Current projections indicate that this may continue to be a challenging summer for wildfires in parts of the country. Forecasts for warm, dry weather indicate the potential for increased fire activity across much of Canada. Natural Resources Canada publicly shares forecasting for the fire season with full transparency regarding the uncertainty inherent in these projections.</p><p>The Government Operations Centre is working to coordinate the federal response to the wildfire situation across the country. Officials are working closely with federal and provincial partners to coordinate this assistance. Efforts are ongoing in Alberta to support the province's Request for Federal Assistance, and additional federal support is available to all communities facing the threat and devastation of ongoing wildfires.</p><p>With federal and provincial contributions, the Government of Canada'sdonation matching program with the Government of Alberta and the Canadian Red Cross has already raised approximately $20 million to support Canadians who have been impacted by wildfires in the province. The Government of Canada will be establishing similar matching programs with Nova Scotia through the Canadian Red Cross and with the Northwest Territories through United Way.</p><p>In addition to providing an update on the present situation, the Ministers also announced that through the Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate Program (FMWCC), the Government of Canada has signed nine agreements through the first phase of the Wildfire Training Fund, a $37.9-million fund designed to hire, train and retain firefighters in communities that need this support the most. These agreements amount to over 300 Indigenous firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians being hired and trained this season.</p><p>In light of the urgent wildfire conditions in Canada, Natural Resources Canada is pleased to be working with the International Association of Fire Fighters to advance a pilot project that would increase Canada's wildfire fire fighting capacity. This project would be focused on training structural firefighters to respond to fires in the wildland-urban interface due to the particular risks those fires pose to homes, communities, and infrastructure.</p><p>This project builds on the Government of Canada's commitment of $256 million over five years to establish the FMWCC program wildfire Equipment Fund, a dedicated federal fund to support provinces and territories in procuring specialized firefighting equipment such as vehicles, mobile units, avionics upgrades, hoses, pumps and enhanced communications equipment. The federal funding has been contributed to six provinces and territories for equipment procured in 2022 2023, andit's expected all provinces and territories will participate in the fund this year.</p><p>Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) continues to support First Nations through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP) to deal with this especially challenging time. Through EMAP, ISC keeps in close contact with affected First Nations and can advance funds or reimburse them for eligible expenses, as needs are identified during daily communications with leadership and other partners such as tribal councils as well as provinces and territories.</p><p>Through these investments and other ongoing actions, the Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadians as all orders of government work together during the 2023 wildfire season.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"Canadians from coast to coast to coast have felt the impact of intense wildfires. These fires threaten our communities, livelihoods and our environment. That is why the federal government is taking action   including training more firefighters, helping provinces and territories procure vital equipment, and developing cutting-edge monitoring technology   to better prepare for, adapt to and fight the effects of wildfires. We will continue to work across government and with Indigenous communities to keep people safe and secure through this wildfire season and seasons to come.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Natural Resources </p><p>\"In communities right across Canada, we have seen an incredibly difficult and dangerous start to the wildfire season. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with all orders of government and Indigenous communities to support Canadians who have been impacted. Thank you to all the firefighters, Canadian Armed Forces members, first responders, search and rescue personnel and community volunteers on the frontlines for their incredible work keeping Canadians safe.\"</p><p>The Honourable Bill BlairPresident of the King's Privy Council and Minister of Emergency Preparedness</p><p>\"First Nations communities are often the first to be affected by climate change. As climate-related emergencies become more frequent, Indigenous Peoples are increasingly facing dangerous, destructive and life changing situations. The unprecedented wildfire season this year is incredibly stressful and emotionally devastating for the many affected communities. We are working with leadership to protect life and property. Indigenous Services Canada will continue to support affected First Nations through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP), and when the time comes, we will be there to help with the rebuilding effort.\"</p><p>The Honourable Patty HajduMinister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"Albertans and Canadians, including many Indigenous communities, have been devastated by the forest fires raging through northern and central Alberta. Our government continues to work closely with our provincial counterparts to send the resources and help needed to keep Albertans and Canadians safe and fight the wildfires. To all the firefighters and first responders across the country and from abroad who are helping to save lives you have my deepest thanks.\"</p><p>The Honourable Randy BoissonnaultMinister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance</p><p>\"The Government of Canada will be there for Nova Scotia and other communities being ravaged by wildfires. The first responders who are keeping us safe are amongst the very best in the world at what they do. Thank you for putting yourselves at risk to keep the rest of us safe. I am so pleased to welcome this investment in training to ensure that you have the resources you need to do this life-saving work.\"</p><p>The Honourable Sean FraserMinister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</p><p> Quick factsA Request for Federal Assistance is initiated when an emergency event overwhelms or threatens to overwhelm the resources of a province or territory and additional federal resources are needed to effectively support the impacted region.Should a province or territory make an official Request for Federal Assistance, there is a well-established process in place for managing the request, through the Government Operations Centre, and includes provincial, territorial and interdepartmental consultation and coordination.Provincial and territorial authorities are the first to respond when a major natural disaster occurs in their jurisdiction. If an emergency requires more resources than the affected province has available, it may ask the federal government for additional resources, which can include Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel and equipment. When the CAF responds to such a crisis, known as Operation LENTUS, assistance is provided to complement and enhance provincial and local resources by helping to stabilize the situation and reassure residents in affected areas.Under Natural Resource Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program Training Fund, a two-year Training Pilot is being implemented with a focus on providing support to Indigenous communities and organizations to train firefighters and to better understand the needs and barriers in the sector. A fully launched fund in 2024 2025 will be informed by the learning obtained from the projects under the pilot. The following Indigenous communities and organizations are receiving funding for training now:Yukon First Nations Wildfire, to train 130 wildland firefighters, including to the Type 1 firefighter standard, across the Yukon and Northern British Columbia;Mushkegowuk Tribal Council Communities, for three of the Ontario First Nation communities they represent, to train 30 individuals in SP100 standard wildland firefighting;Prince Albert Grand Council, for its Indigenous Wildfire Stewards Pilot Program, to train approximately 125 wildland firefighters as Indigenous Fire Stewards and hire Elder Advisors;Independent First Nations Alliance, to train 45 community members in SP100 and SP103 standard wildland firefighting across five Ontario communities;Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation, to train 12 community members to the Type 2 wildland firefighter standard to combat wildfires in Manitoba;Miawpukek First Nation (MFN), to train 34 firefighters with Fire Smart training in the MFN territory in Newfoundland and Labrador;T\u00c5ilhqot'in National Government, to train 20 community members to the Type 2 Indigenous Initial Attack firefighter standard in six T\u00c5ilhqot'in communities in British Columbia;Innu Nation, to train 13 community members in wildland firefighting in Newfoundland and Labrador; andCanadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, to train 24 Indigenous firefighters to the Type 2 wildland firefighting standard in two communities in Nova Scotia.Under Natural Resource Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program Equipment Fund, provinces and territories can cost-share investments for equipment, such as vehicles, mobile units, avionics upgrades (parts), hoses, pumps, enhanced communications equipment, repair of aging equipment and training.

As of May 31, advance payment funding has been provided to Alberta, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Manitoba and Nova Scotia. These funds are intended to cover costs associated with evacuations including transportation, accommodations and meals. Funds also cover emergency response measures including establishing fire guards and putting in place Emergency Operation Centres where possible. In addition to advance payments, communities seeking reimbursement after an emergency are encouraged to submit estimates or invoices as quickly as possible to help ensure a timely community recovery.As the wildfires are still active, ISC continues to support communities affected and is in daily contact with leadership to discuss the day-to-day plans and supports required, as well as the long-term actions needed to support the communities that have had a loss of infrastructure.FPT partners are working together under the auspices of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers to implement the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy to enable national wildfire resilience.Current information on national fire conditions is available publicly at all times through NRCan's Canadian Wildland Fire Information System. Additionally, during the fire season, the Canadian Forest Service supports emergency and fire management agencies through the development of situation reports (fire weather forecasts, situational awareness) and the delivery of fire growth and behaviour models.The Government of Canada, through Environment and Climate Change Canada, is committed to providing support to all our partners by supplying weather information including detailed precipitation and wind forecasts, smoke dispersion predictions and air quality forecasts. Access the latest weather information with weather.gc.ca.Canada's first National Adaptation Strategy, released in November 2022 for a final 90 days of engagement with provinces, territories, and National Indigenous Organizations, sets an overarching vision for climate resilience in Canada, including with respect to disaster resilience. The Government of Canada Adaptation Action Plan, released alongside the Strategy, announced new funding of up to $284 million over five years to reduce the risks of wildfire in our communities, including by enhancing community prevention and mitigation activities, supporting innovation in wildland fire knowledge and research, and establishing a Centre of Excellence for Wildland Fire Innovation and Resilience.Related documentsA Request for Federal Assistance is initiated when an emergency event overwhelms or threatens to overwhelm the resources of a province or territory and additional federal resources are needed to effectively support the impacted region.Should a province or territory make an official Request for Federal Assistance, there is a well-established process in place for managing the request, through the Government Operations Centre, and includes provincial, territorial and interdepartmental consultation and coordination.Provincial and territorial authorities are the first to respond when a major natural disaster occurs in their jurisdiction.

We know it,\" she said. \"It's absolutely wrong to convert to natural gas. Why is anyone doing this in 2023?\"<br/><br/> In communities from Bobcaygeon to Scugog, Enbridge Gas has been distributing marketing materials to convince homeowners to connect to its expanded natural gas pipelines, telling them it's the cheapest way to heat their homes and that it's \"clean\" and \"low carbon.\"<br/><br/> These flyers are now the subject of a false-advertising complaint filed with the Competition Bureau.<br/><br/> \"Enbridge is misleading customers into connecting to its gas system through deceptive marketing,\" states the complaint filed by a coalition of environmental groups, including Environmental Defence, Ontario Clean Air Alliance and Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.<br/><br/> \"Enbridge knows ... that gas is not the most cost-effective way to heat homes, and that gas is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes far more to climate change when used to heat homes in comparison to electricity,\" the complaint says.<br/><br/> \"With each week that passes, more customers sign up to convert their heating to gas instead of purchasing a high-efficiency electric heat pump resulting in unnecessarily high energy costs and carbon pollution to the detriment of consumers, competition, and the climate.\"<br/><br/> The Enbridge Gas materials fail to tell potential customers that natural gas - which is mostly methane - is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in Ontario, according to the complaint, and ignore the fact that heat pumps have been found to be significantly cheaper to operate.<br/><br/> The complaint is the latest in a spate of greenwashing claims made to the Competition Bureau, including two filed last year against the Canadian Gas Association for suggesting that natural gas is \"sustainable\" and another alleging RBC's claims to fight climate change are false.<br/><br/> A subsidiary of Calgary-based Enbridge Inc., which will soon be North America's largest natural gas utility, Enbridge Gas is expanding its pipeline network to communities on the fringes of the GTA and must convince residents to pay thousands of dollars to buy new furnaces so they can convert their houses for natural gas heating.<br/><br/> In flyers, community meetings and local and online advertising, Enbridge Gas states that switching to natural gas could save homeowners up to 54 per cent on heating costs. The environmental groups cite research showing that new customers in a natural gas expansion community (who must pay a surcharge on their natural gas for up to 40 years) would actually save $20,000 over the 15-year lifetime of their equipment by switching to a heat pump instead.<br/><br/> \"For a long time, methane gas was the cheapest way to heat homes. However, electric cold climate heat pumps are now much cheaper than gas for consumers,\" states the complaint. \"Customers are very vulnerable to deceptive advertising about the benefits of gas heating because most are not aware of heat pumps or the advancements that have been made in heat pumps in recent years.\"<br/><br/> In response to questions, an Enbridge Gas spokesperson said the cost of a heat pump can vary greatly between houses.<br/><br/> \"As such, a simple comparison of the technology costs alone can be misleading,\" said spokesperson Andrea Stass, in an email. \"Based on our analysis, conversion to a high-efficiency electric cold climate air source heat pump configuration could be more cost-effective for space heating in some situations ... whereas in others, a natural gas solution would be more cost-effective,\" she wrote.<br/><br/> According to filings, Enbridge expects to connect over 100,000 households to its natural gas network in the next three years. The environmental groups are asking the Competition Bureau to require Enbridge to send price comparisons between natural gas and heat pumps to all of them.<br/><br/> \"Enbridge is trying to push gas into more communities and trying to hook more customers up to gas at a time when we're in a climate emergency and we should be moving away from burning fossil fuels,\" said Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence.<br/><br/> \"If you're going to be installing new HVAC, you've got to be going for a heat pump. It'll save you money. It's better for the climate. Every time we install a new gas furnace, that's an appliance that will be burning fossil fuels for a decade or more.\"<br/><br/> After learning about the new pipeline coming to Sandford, Carswell started doing research online. She was surprised to learn that the network expansions aren't economical, so the provincial government authorized a $1 per month surcharge on all 3.8 million Enbridge Gas customers (which equals more than $45 million per year) to pay for the new pipelines.<br/><br/> \"Why are we facilitating the expansion of natural gas?\" she asked. \"You can have affordable utilities without increasing your emissions.\"<br/><br/> Carswell has been heating her home with a heat pump since the 1990s and stands by the technology as cheaper - and better for the climate - than natural gas.<br/><br/> In materials filed with the Ontario Energy Board, Enbridge Gas compared the costs of different heating systems in Sandford, but claimed there was \"no data available\" for heat pumps.<br/><br/> \"That's absolutely misleading,\" Carswell said. Since Enbridge Gas administers the government grants for heat pumps, \"they know exactly how much they cost. They should be telling people about the grants.\"<br/><br/> Programs offered through the federal and provincial governments now offer $10,000 to homeowners switching to a heat pump. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2023090969001707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694H-W8B1-F197-50YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1018\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The latest is about the slow pace of four-laning the Trans Canada through the Shuswap.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not we agree on this issue, I\u2019m afraid you have misapprehended your job as an MLA. You were elected, which makes you now part of the government. You may be in the opposition, but that remains part of the actual government, sitting in Victoria\u2019s legislature, as it says in your title.</p><p>It is incumbent upon you, as our elected MLA, to actually make changes when you see them as necessary and when your constituents bring them to your attention, not simply to talk about how it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility. When you were elected, it became your responsibility to at least try.</p><p>It\u2019s also your responsibility to look ahead in the long term, and try to figure out what will be the best thing for everyone in your patch and in the province, not short-term fixes or simply opposing everything because you sit on the other side of the legislature.</p><p>The governing system under which we operate requires that our elected representatives take on a long view and a wide lens, taking into consideration the needs of people at all levels, the environment which supports us, the economy and national or international relations. This requires working together as well as pointing out where policies and actions may be going wrong, and making constructive suggestions to improve legislation and implementation.</p><p>Finally, on the issue of the Trans Canada four-laning projects, one might consider that four-laning has not reduced accidents, but has created massive environmental destruction. Paving wetlands and tearing down mountainsides will increase our risk for forest fire and reduce the ability of the environment to absorb increased flooding, both of which are manifestly issues we have to face.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EAGLEV-news20221117PQBA0003143083</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EAGLEV2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66WJ-HGX1-F0HF-82XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438284</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

We know it,\" she said. \"It's absolutely wrong to convert to natural gas. Why is anyone doing this in 2023?\"<br/><br/> In communities from Bobcaygeon to Scugog, Enbridge Gas has been distributing marketing materials to convince homeowners to connect to its expanded natural gas pipelines, telling them it's the cheapest way to heat their homes and that it's \"clean\" and \"low carbon.\"<br/><br/> These flyers are now the subject of a false-advertising complaint filed with the Competition Bureau.<br/><br/> \"Enbridge is misleading customers into connecting to its gas system through deceptive marketing,\" states the complaint filed by a coalition of environmental groups, including Environmental Defence, Ontario Clean Air Alliance and Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.<br/><br/> \"Enbridge knows ... that gas is not the most cost-effective way to heat homes, and that gas is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes far more to climate change when used to heat homes in comparison to electricity,\" the complaint says.<br/><br/> \"With each week that passes, more customers sign up to convert their heating to gas instead of purchasing a high-efficiency electric heat pump resulting in unnecessarily high energy costs and carbon pollution to the detriment of consumers, competition, and the climate.\"<br/><br/> The Enbridge Gas materials fail to tell potential customers that natural gas - which is mostly methane - is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in Ontario, according to the complaint, and ignore the fact that heat pumps have been found to be significantly cheaper to operate.<br/><br/> The complaint is the latest in a spate of greenwashing claims made to the Competition Bureau, including two filed last year against the Canadian Gas Association for suggesting that natural gas is \"sustainable\" and another alleging RBC's claims to fight climate change are false.<br/><br/> A subsidiary of Calgary-based Enbridge Inc., which will soon be North America's largest natural gas utility, Enbridge Gas is expanding its pipeline network to communities on the fringes of the GTA and must convince residents to pay thousands of dollars to buy new furnaces so they can convert their houses for natural gas heating.<br/><br/> In flyers, community meetings and local and online advertising, Enbridge Gas states that switching to natural gas could save homeowners up to 54 per cent on heating costs. The environmental groups cite research showing that new customers in a natural gas expansion community (who must pay a surcharge on their natural gas for up to 40 years) would actually save $20,000 over the 15-year lifetime of their equipment by switching to a heat pump instead.<br/><br/> \"For a long time, methane gas was the cheapest way to heat homes. However, electric cold climate heat pumps are now much cheaper than gas for consumers,\" states the complaint. \"Customers are very vulnerable to deceptive advertising about the benefits of gas heating because most are not aware of heat pumps or the advancements that have been made in heat pumps in recent years.\"<br/><br/> In response to questions, an Enbridge Gas spokesperson said the cost of a heat pump can vary greatly between houses.<br/><br/> \"As such, a simple comparison of the technology costs alone can be misleading,\" said spokesperson Andrea Stass, in an email. \"Based on our analysis, conversion to a high-efficiency electric cold climate air source heat pump configuration could be more cost-effective for space heating in some situations ... whereas in others, a natural gas solution would be more cost-effective,\" she wrote.<br/><br/> According to filings, Enbridge expects to connect over 100,000 households to its natural gas network in the next three years. The environmental groups are asking the Competition Bureau to require Enbridge to send price comparisons between natural gas and heat pumps to all of them.<br/><br/> \"Enbridge is trying to push gas into more communities and trying to hook more customers up to gas at a time when we're in a climate emergency and we should be moving away from burning fossil fuels,\" said Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence.<br/><br/> \"If you're going to be installing new HVAC, you've got to be going for a heat pump. It'll save you money. It's better for the climate. Every time we install a new gas furnace, that's an appliance that will be burning fossil fuels for a decade or more.\"<br/><br/> After learning about the new pipeline coming to Sandford, Carswell started doing research online. She was surprised to learn that the network expansions aren't economical, so the provincial government authorized a $1 per month surcharge on all 3.8 million Enbridge Gas customers (which equals more than $45 million per year) to pay for the new pipelines.<br/><br/> \"Why are we facilitating the expansion of natural gas?\" she asked. \"You can have affordable utilities without increasing your emissions.\"<br/><br/> Carswell has been heating her home with a heat pump since the 1990s and stands by the technology as cheaper - and better for the climate - than natural gas.<br/><br/> In materials filed with the Ontario Energy Board, Enbridge Gas compared the costs of different heating systems in Sandford, but claimed there was \"no data available\" for heat pumps.<br/><br/> \"That's absolutely misleading,\" Carswell said. Since Enbridge Gas administers the government grants for heat pumps, \"they know exactly how much they cost. They should be telling people about the grants.\"<br/><br/> Programs offered through the federal and provincial governments now offer $10,000 to homeowners switching to a heat pump. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2023090969001592</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694H-W8B1-F197-50YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1018\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Its estimated burned surface could be up to 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres), state news agency EFE [2]reported. <br/>Those who fled the blaze took shelter in one of three sports arenas in nearby towns, according to CTV News Canada[3]. Firefighters said the outlook for taming the blaze depends on the weather, but gusty winds up to 60 kilometers (37 m.p.h.) were predicted. <br/>Drought and extremely high temperatures in the Mediterranean country are turning 2022 into the worst year of the century in terms of fires. <br/>European Forest Fire Information System[4]weekly temperature anomalies for the week of August 8 through August 14, 2022. <br/>This year alone, the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition has recorded 43 large wildfires that have burned at least 500 hectares (1,250 acres) or more. This is four times the amount of the previous year and a record for the last decade.  <br/>The European Forest Fire Information System says 248,674 hectares (615,000 acres) have burned in wildfires so far this year in Spain. That's almost four times the country's full-year average of 66,965 hectares (165,000 acres) since 2006 when records began. <br/><url

Ma said at a briefing about drought conditions in B.C. that a team from Australia is arriving on Saturday, adding to the 160 international personnel from Mexico and the United States currently deployed in B.C. She said the Australians are an \u201cincident management team.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters from South Korea, France, South Africa and the Dominican Republic have also been fighting fires in Canada, during what is shaping up as a record-breaking fire season.</p><p>Blair, federal minister of emergency preparedness, had earlier said he was expecting a \u201cfairly substantive\u201d request for help from B.C. as wildfires worsen.</p><p>Blair told The Canadian Press the government operations centre has been in discussions with the province for the last several days, and Ottawa is ready to deploy needed resources.</p><p>\u201cThe fire season now is obviously sparking up pretty seriously out there and they have sent us an indication of some additional resources that they will require,\u201d he said in an interview Thursday.</p><p>\u201cFor the last 48 hours we\u2019ve been working with Canadian Armed Forces, Parks Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and people from the Canadian Coast Guard,\u201d said Blair. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different federal departments all mobilizing their response to the requirements of British Columbia.\u201d</p><p>He said the federal help could include military assistance for airlift evacuations from remote locations, as well as members of the military trained as firefighters who can provide \u201cmop up\u201d to keep blazes from reigniting once they\u2019ve been put out.</p><p>\u201cIf there are communities that become isolated and need to be evacuated, then Canadian Armed Forces provides those resources,\u201d Blair said.</p><p>The Canadian Coast Guard is also mobilizing support for affected coastal communities, and Natural Resources Canada staff with forest management expertise are also preparing to help, he said.</p><p>Blair added there are a number of national parks in B.C. , so Parks Canada is ready to aid the province with park firefighters and forest management experts.</p><p>Blair said B.C. is one of the better equipped provinces to handle fires because it is often among the hardest hit, but any extra help needed is being made available.</p><p>Ma\u2019s request for more international help was lodged through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which co-ordinates firefighting resources across the country.</p><p>Premier David Eby said earlier this week the province was looking for more firefighting support, particularly air equipment, in its battle against wildfires.</p><p>He said forecasts suggest B.C. and Canada could be facing the worst fire season in 100 years.</p><p>Eby expressed gratitude for the help provided by international firefighters from Mexico and the United States who are on the frontlines with provincial crews.</p><p>Rural and northern B.C. communities have felt the brunt of this year\u2019s wildfire season, but on Wednesday, smoke from a blaze on the mountains overlooking Vancouver could be seen across the city, as helicopters dropped water to extinguish the flames.</p><p>Brant Arnold-Smith, director of the Metro Vancouver regional district\u2019s emergency operations centre, said at a media briefing Thursday that crews were still tackling hot spots, saying the fire in North Vancouver\u2019s Seymour conservation area is deep underground.</p><p>\u201cWe are quite confident that it will not spread anymore,\u201d he said.</p><p>Arnold-Smith said their initial theory suggested it was caused by lightning, but they\u2019re not ruling out that it was human caused until an investigation is done.</p><p>But he said the fire was in a \u201crugged, secluded area\u201d where people rarely trek, taking an hour and a half for crews to reach the scene through thick brush.</p><p>\u201cThis event serves as an important reminder as to how dry our region is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost a month of just no precipitation in the region, so our green spaces are very dry and very susceptible to any sort of ignition sources that could cause a wildfire.</p><p>There are more than 350 wildfires burning in all corners of the province, and the BC Wildfire Service warns another blast of heat in many areas could add more burdens on already overstretched crews.</p><p>The wildfire service says a weekold, 300-square-kilometre blaze close to Highway 37 just south of the Yukon boundary has been calm, but it and similar fires across northern B.C. could flare up during the next several days of expected hot weather.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Some do. Some do. But a lot of times the workers are forgotten.\"</p><p>The think tank meetings in Quesnel were, by their nature, aimed at disruption and innovation of old forestry practices. Bains said these were exciting conversations built on solid ideas, but innovation must always have lines drawn closely to the worker, in the policy development that must go along with developments in timber harvesting, forest regrowth, and new uses for wood. These innovations would trigger new training, re-training, new hardware, company investment decisions, and necessary consultation with First Nations. He outlined how government was already involved in those shifts, and would be there for the next steps not yet taken.</p><p>For example, he said, sometime at the end of 2023 or early 2024 would be the next labour relations review for B.C.</p><p>\"I expect all of you to participate in that review, because the forestry workplace is changing, the laws governing that work have to keep up. We must modernize the relationship between employers and workers.\"</p><p>Safety was always his first priority, he said. Not only would that ensure the people who go to work at the start of shift also went home to their families at the end of shift, but if companies and governments kept their own focus on the safety of the individual worker, other factors would organically extend from that in corporate and governance decisions. One example he underlined was making sure women were paid the same money for the same work as male counterparts, to unlock the underrepresented female population in trades professions and forestry professions like never before, at a time when the sector needs all the workers it can get.</p><p>\"The future of forestry affects all of us, and together we are building a stronger and more resilient B.C., and an economy that works for all,\" he said.</p><p>READ MORE: Finland and Quesnel exchange forestry knowledge</p><p>READ MORE: B.C. forest industry looks to get out of the woods</p><p>Copyright 2023 Quesnel Cariboo Observer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230511PQC4469221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686T-6RJ1-JD2C-J3K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(\"Amex or the Company\")announces that it has ceased exploration activities at the Perron project in accordance with a directive from the Ministre des Ressources Naturelles et des Forts which has banned forest access on Crown land and closure of roads, meaning immediate stop of any mining exploration activities (see the map) within a prescribed area due to forest fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Victor Cantore, President and CEO of Amex Exploration said, \"We have temporarily stopped all exploration work at Perron until the situation improves. We remain in communications with local and provincial authorities on the current status of the forest fire situation and will update the market with respect to any material changes.\"</p><p>The Amex team is working remotely and the Company has 5,151 samples at the lab for assay, the results of which will be communicated once received and analyzed.</p><p>About Amex</p><p>Amex Exploration Inc. has made significant gold discoveries on its 100% owned high-grade Perron Gold Project located ~110 kilometres north of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, consisting of 117 contiguous claims covering 4,518 hectares. The project is well-serviced by existing infrastructure, on a year-round road, 10 minutes from an airport and just outside the town of Normtal (~8 km). In addition, the project is in close proximity to a number of major gold producers' milling operations. The project hosts both bulk tonnage and a high-grade gold style mineralization. Since January 2019, Amex has intersected significant gold mineralization in multiple gold zones and discovered copper-rich VMS zones.</p><p>For further information please contact:</p><p>Victor Cantore</p><p>President and Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Amex Exploration: +1-514-866-8209</p><p>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>Forward-looking statements</p><p>This news release contains forward-looking statements. All statements, other than of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including, without limitation, the planned exploration program on the HGZ and Denise Zone, the expected positive exploration results, the extension of the mineralized zones, the timing of the exploration results, the ability of the Company to continue with the exploration program, the availability of the required funds to continue with the exploration and the potential mineralization or potential mineral resources are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words \"will\", \"should\", \"continue\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"estimate\", \"believe\", \"intend\", \"to earn\", \"to have', \"plan\" or \"project\" or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, that may cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, failure to meet expected, estimated or planned exploration expenditures, failure to establish estimated mineral resources, the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the Company's expectations, general business and economic conditions, changes in world gold markets, sufficient labour and equipment being available, changes in laws and permitting requirements, unanticipated weather changes, title disputes and claims, environmental risks as well as those risks identified in the Company's annual Management's Discussion and Analysis. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described and accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Although the Company has attempted to identify important risks, uncertainties and factors which could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be others that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. The Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

These shifts, combined with forestry policies and climate change effects, greatly increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire.\u201d \u2013 Keith Atkinson, Chair, BC Forest Practices Board (BCFPB) Forestry experts have long warned that forest practices and government policies are intensifying wildfire risk. But industry and government have disregarded numerous studies and persistent calls for action. Practices and policies are little changed. The results have been disastrous as expanses of forest, extensive infrastructure and numerous homes have been razed, and as the air has been fouled and fire suppression costs have multiplied. Increasingly, wildfire ravages more land in less time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On June 26, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Service, reported that over 7,600,000 hectares had burned in Canada to date in 2023. That surpassed the previous annual record of 7,560,000 hectares in 1989. Six months of 2023 saw more area destroyed than 12 months of the record year. The average fire in 2023 was four times larger than in 1989. Extreme fire seasons have been common this century.</p><p>In British Columbia to July 4, 2023, 621 fires burned 1,042,000 hectares. In the record year of 2018, 1,354,000 hectares were lost to 2,117 fires. The area burned this year is almost certainly on track to exceed the record year, with most of the two peak fire months yet to be added to the tally. It is also likely that BC\u2019s loss to wildfire will top 2 million hectares. Some hope remains that extensive summer rain will intervene, but not much.</p><p>The BCFPB on June 29 released their report, \u201cForest and Fire Management in BC\u201d. The report relates that the 2021 wildfire season resulted in $800 million in fire suppression costs and indirect costs as high as $24 billion. Costs include damage to private property and infrastructure and extensive loss of soil productivity, timber supply and wildlife habitat. Since 2018, the province has spent $72 million on fuel reduction measures, says the report, \u201calmost exclusively\u201d within the wildland urban interface (WUI).</p><p>The budget for mitigation is dwarfed by fire suppression costs, and is almost non-existent relative to the extensive costs of wildfire, as areas impacted and severity of impact greatly expand. The largest fire in BC history now rages in BC\u2019s far north. The Donnie Creek Wild-fire, at over 570,000 hectares, has burned an area equivalent to that of BC\u2019s entire fifth largest fire season. It is expected to continue to burn through to the end of the season. The destruction of timber and wildlife habitat is already immense.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a professor of fire science at Thompson River University, told the CBC that without climate change this fire season would have been impossible. \u201cThe warmer it gets, the more efficient the atmosphere is at sucking the moisture of the fuels \u2026 on the forest floor,\u201d he noted. BC forest scientists fear a loss in the diversity of tree species, and expect vast forested areas will be replaced by grasslands.</p><p>Flanigan co-authored a study concluding, \u201cDryer and warmer weather, will increase the incidence of short-interval reburning and amplify the ecological changes such events cause, as wildfire activity and post-fire drought increase synergistically.\u201d This demands rapid action by government and industry.</p><p>Promisingly, techniques to mitigate risks in forests and reduce wildfire events exist. Governments need only adopt them, and of course pay for them. Forestry experts recommend that fuel reduction measures must be expanded and targeted beyond the WUI. Provincial policy and regulation should require all areas harvested to be reforested, not just with the most economically viable species, but with those species native to the area to improve resilience. Destructive forestry activities, like widespread salvage logging after disasters, should be prohibited. These measures and others provide only part of the solution.</p><p>The BCFPB report recommends \u2013 more accurately, urges \u2013 a comprehensive approach called landscape fire management (LFM). \u201cLFM is a way to proactively mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on the broader landscape. It is a restoration approach to addressing forest fuel buildup and improving landscape resilience,\u201d the report reads. \u201cAchieving this paradigm shift will require bold and immediate action by the provincial government to align policies and programs across all levels of government with a vision of landscape resilience and co-existence with fire.\u201d</p><p>LFM will require major effort and a significant budget. Should the BC government continue to avoid the responsibility and the expense, the environment and economy of this province will be irretrievably damaged.</p><p>Bruce W Uzelman obtained a Bachelor of Arts, Advanced with majors in Economics and Political Science in 1982.

With the wildfires that are active in a large part of Quebec, particularly near the city of Lebel-sur-Quvillon, the Ministre des Ressources naturelles et des Forts (MRNF) has modified the ban of forest access on Crown land and closure of roads. Following that directive, Bonterra has stopped its exploration activities and evacuated safely all personnel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Marc-Andr Pelletier, President and CEO commented: \"The forest fire situation is exceptional and Bonterra remains on the lookout for any development. The Barry and Gladiator camps and the Bachelor Mill Complex are not currently in danger, but we continue to monitor the situation with the authorities. We sincerely hope the situation will improve over the week.\"</p><p>About Bonterra Resources Inc.</p><p>Bonterra is a Canadian gold exploration company with a large portfolio of advanced exploration assets anchored by a central milling facility in Quebec, Canada. The Company has four main assets, Gladiator, Barry, Moroy, and Bachelor that collectively have a total of 1.24 million ounces in Measured and Indicated categories, and 1.78 million ounces in Inferred category. Importantly, the Company owns the only permitted and operational gold mill in the region. Bonterra is focused on graduating from advanced exploration to a development company to deliver shareholder value.</p><p>FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p><p>Marc-Andr Pelletier, President &amp; CEO</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:ir@btrgold.com\">ir@btrgold.com</url></p><p>2872 Sullivan Road, Suite 2, Val d'Or, Quebec J9P 0B9</p><p>819-279-9304 | Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/KJgyvcO8LG\">www.btrgold.com</url></p><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>Caution regarding forward-looking statements</p><p>This press release contains \"forward-looking information\" that is based on Bonterra's current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections.

That causes branches to break off trees. Sometimes, entire trees fall. Both increase the amount of dry tinder on the forest floor.<br/><br/> The ice- and wind-damaged forests are prone to more insect infestations, causing more trees to die and further increasing the amount of dead, dry wood.<br/><br/> \"Things like that are going to be an increasing risk,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> Wildfires in northern Alberta have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Thousands more had to evacuate in Halifax suburbs after a wildfire spread into a built-up area. <br/><br/> \"As you expand communities into forested areas because people love to live near forests, you are increasing your risk because you are putting more buildings in harm's way,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> The residential areas closest to forests and conservation areas are at a higher risk. <br/><br/> Homeowners can take simple precautions to protect their properties, said Evans. Do not pile firewood next to buildings, keep lawns cut, sweep <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2023/06/01/fire-at-kitchener-townhouse-complex-started-on-deck-before-quickly-spreading-to-rear-police.html\">decks</url> clear of pine needles and leaves, cut down dead trees, and pick up dead branches and other organic material from the ground. If you can afford it, install a metal roof.<br/><br/> \"Fifty to 90 per cent of homes destroyed by wildfires are ignited by floating embers,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> It is very unlikely wildfires will ever hit cities like Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but smaller towns and villages in rural areas next to forests and large woodlots are at a higher risk, said Tom O'Hara, spokesperson for the Kitchener Fire Department.<br/><br/> \"Most of our urban centres here are not surrounded by dense bush and ground cover like up north, out west and out east,\" said O'Hara.<br/><br/> Kitchener firefighters have been able to quickly put out grass fires, he said. Grass fires are reported early, and do not have the chance to grow into a multi-hectare blaze before firefighters arrive, said O'Hara.<br/><br/> The townships may impose a fire ban if there is no rain next week, said Wilmot Fire Chief Rod Leeson. The risk of a large grass fire or forest fire laying waste to housing in Wilmot is very low, but there is some risk, Leeson said.<br/><br/> \"There are some areas like Sunfish Lake which have permanent homes built in areas that are forested,\" said Leeson. <br/><br/> Governments must address the cause of climate change - the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels - or the fires will only get worse, said Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner.<br/><br/> Summer does not begin for nearly three weeks, but the burning season has already started in parts of Ontario.<br/><br/> \"Already we're seeing communities like Sudbury, Timmins and areas around the Georgian Bay placed under extreme fire warning,\" said Schreiner.<br/><br/> As the climate emergency worsens, weather-related disasters such as forest fires will become more severe and frequent - disproportionately impacting First Nations communities in the North, as well as people with precarious housing, said Schreiner.<br/><br/> \"This is a matter of environmental injustice,\" said Schreiner. \"(Premier) Doug Ford needs to wake up and take action on the climate emergency.\"<br/><br/> That means more funding to help municipalities prepare infrastructure for extreme weather, halting plans to reopen natural gas plants to generate electricity, and investing more in renewable energy, said Schreiner.<br/><br/> As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme-weather events, they will continue to hurt communities across the province, he said.<br/><br/> \"Here in southern Ontario, we're already feeling the effects of the current fires - in smoky skies and poor air quality,\" said Schreiner.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Correction:</emphasis> This story has been edited to attribute Green party comments to Mike Schreiner, MPP for Guelph and leader of the provincial party.</emphasis><br/><br/> Terry Pender is a Waterloo Region-based general assignment reporter for The Record.

Wildfire Service budget soared to $500 million and an estimated $80 million in tourism and other economic costs in the Central Okanagan alone. The urgency was reinforced by another severe fire season in 2009, where the bill reached $400 million.</p><p>\u201cMany of the 2003 and 2009 fires occurred in areas where fuels had accumulated over decades, and during dry, hot weather conditions, these fires became very large and intense,\u201d says the province\u2019s Wildland Fire Management Strategy, released in 2010 and still in effect today. \u201cFires like this remove so much forest cover that soil productivity can be reduced and soil erosion can lead to flooding, landslides, decreased water quality and a variety of other negative consequences.\u201d</p><p>Local politics is one impediment to changing an aggressive timber protection that started in the late 1940s as post-war heavy equipment and aircraft became available. Prescribed burns in spring produce heavy smoke, and for decades logging restrictions focused on preserving \u201cview corridors\u201d along highways and around communities, accumulating fuel in the highest-risk locations.</p><p>In the latest revamp of forest policy, Premier John Horgan and Forests Minister Katrine Conroy have committed to more use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel load, citing Indigenous forest burn practices that cleaned out underbrush to make forests passable for migration and hunting.</p><p>Fuel cleanup around communities has pro-ceeded slowly since the recommendations made after the 2003 fires. This past June, bracing for another hot summer of wildfires, the B.C. government added $20 million more to its community resiliency fund. The program has assisted 116 B.C. communities with wildfire risk reduction work since 2018, when it was set up in response to back-to-back record wildfire years in B.C. The Union of B.C. Municipalities administers the community grant fund, along with the First Nations\u2019 Emergency Services Society of B.C. The next application intake begins June 30, for projects including residential fuel reduction, critical infrastructure protection, FireSmart training, emergency management, community planning and inter-agency cooperation.</p><p>Communities that can demonstrate high wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000 to cover up to 100 per cent of project costs, while lower-risk communities can apply for up to $50,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20211006PPXA0002141823</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SP-5KG1-JD2C-J11B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Flames from the lightning-caused Downton Lake wildfire, 110 kilometres northwest of the Resort Community of Whistler, have made steady progress through steep, wooded terrain at the western end of Gun Lake since the blaze was sparked on July 13. The fire suddenly flared on Monday. While Rose said he initially felt safe from his vantage point on the eastern side of the lake, he and his partner decided to get out Tuesday, just as an evacuation order covering the more than 200 properties around the lake was issued. </p><p>The order was quickly upgraded to critical, urging the seasonal and permanent residents to leave for Lillooet or Whistler. Evacuation alerts were also extended to areas north of Gun Lake, including Tyaughton Lake and the Tyax Resort, as the nearly 18-square-kilometre fire almost quadrupled in size since Monday. Rose said his father\u2019s cabin has been in his family since 1945 and it is where he spent his childhood summers. \u201cThere was always the fear of lightning (and) there was always a fear of a campfire setting off a forest fire and destroying the incredible natural beauty around that lake, so that\u2019s always been a fear in the back of our heads and now it\u2019s actually happened,\u201d he said. He said the fire has burned family traditions and heritage to the ground. \u201cSo, this is the first time in my 52 years that I\u2019ve ever actually seen it. And it ended up close. So, it has this sort of sense of \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 of devastation,\u201d Rose said of watching the fire destroy the homes on the oppo-site side of the lake. Rose\u2019s father, 81-yearold John Rose, said in a previous interview that he intended to stay as long as possible to keep the sprinklers running on the roof of their log house and on the heritage cabins on the neighbouring property built by his parents in the 1940s. \u201cThis isn\u2019t heroic,\u201d said John Rose, a retired BC Parks Service ranger. \u201cI just don\u2019t think anyone else could handle this set up.\u201d Owen Rose said his father has since reassessed the situation and left the property on Wednesday. He said their cabin was still standing and he hopes it stays that way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three generations and memories that are there. That would be the greatest loss. It\u2019s a massive psychological loss if they were to go,\u201d he said. Wildfire Service director of operations Cliff Chapman told a news conference Wednesday that hot and dry conditions are likely to persist and strong winds will continue to pose a challenge on the fire lines. \u201cThe conditions at Gun Lake specifically are quite challenging with the steep terrain, so we are utilizing our aviation assets. We have ground resources on that fire including structure protection, but also fire suppression crews,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t confirm the number of homes lost to the fire. \u201cThe plan will be to continue to try to protect the structures around Gun Lake and ideally try to steer that fire away from the structures and communities while the conditions persist and make it very challenging for us to actually suppress the fire.\u201d The Gun Lake fire is among about 360 active wildfires across B.C. , including 14 that the B.C. Wildfire Service says were sparked since Tuesday. The Thompson-Nicola Regional District issued an evacuation alert late Wednesday for approximately 75 properties near Adams Lake in Rivers and the Peaks areas due to the Lower East Adams Lake wildfire. The Columbia Shuswap Regional District also issued an evacuation alert for the Northern Reach of Tsutswecw Provincial Park because of the same fire. The destroyed homes, evacuation orders and alerts came as most residents of the southern Okanagan town of Osoyoos were returning to their homes after a wildfire raced north from Washington state on Sat-urday, burning to within metres of some properties before a wind shift spared the community. The flare up of the Downton Lake blaze happened just as the young Ontario firefighter who died last week in northeastern B.C. , was identified as 25-year-old Zak Muise. Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma told the news conference that about 530 people at more than 500 properties are under evacuation order across B.C. , and more than 9,500 people at 4,100 properties are under evacuation alert. As of Wednesday, Ma said 23 of the province\u2019s 34 water basins are in drought Level 4 or 5, meaning harm to ecosystems and communities is likely and efforts should be made to conserve water and protect critical environmental flows. \u201cIt\u2019s important that our extreme drought situation is not overshadowed by the ongoing wildfire situation,\u201d Ma said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s incredibly important that everyone, including businesses, follow all local water restrictions,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery drop counts.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20230804PTEA0003776504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68W2-C8X1-F0HF-8373-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

That causes branches to break off trees. Sometimes, entire trees fall. Both increase the amount of dry tinder on the forest floor.</p><p>The ice- and wind-damaged forests are prone to more insect infestations, causing more trees to die and further increasing the amount of dead, dry wood.</p><p>\"Things like that are going to be an increasing risk,\" said Evans.</p><p>Wildfires in northern Alberta have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Thousands more had to evacuate in Halifax suburbs after a wildfire spread into a built-up area.</p><p>\"As you expand communities into forested areas because people love to live near forests, you are increasing your risk because you are putting more buildings in harm's way,\" said Evans.</p><p>The residential areas closest to forests and conservation areas are at a higher risk.</p><p>Homeowners can take simple precautions to protect their properties, said Evans. Do not pile firewood next to buildings, keep lawns cut, sweep decks clear of pine needles and leaves, cut down dead trees, and pick up dead branches and other organic material from the ground. If you can afford it, install a metal roof.</p><p>\"Fifty to 90 per cent of homes destroyed by wildfires are ignited by floating embers,\" said Evans.</p><p>It is very unlikely wildfires will ever hit cities like Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but smaller towns and villages in rural areas next to forests and large woodlots are at a higher risk, said Tom O'Hara, spokesperson for the Kitchener Fire Department.</p><p>\"Most of our urban centres here are not surrounded by dense bush and ground cover like up north, out west and out east,\" said O'Hara.</p><p>Kitchener firefighters have been able to quickly put out grass fires, he said. Grass fires are reported early, and do not have the chance to grow into a multi-hectare blaze before firefighters arrive, said O'Hara.</p><p>The townships may impose a fire ban if there is no rain next week, said Wilmot Fire Chief Rod Leeson. The risk of a large grass fire or forest fire laying waste to housing in Wilmot is very low, but there is some risk, Leeson said.</p><p>\"There are some areas like Sunfish Lake which have permanent homes built in areas that are forested,\" said Leeson.</p><p>Governments must address the cause of climate change - the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels - or the fires will only get worse, said Kitchener Centre MPP Mike Morrice.</p><p>Summer does not begin for nearly three weeks, but the burning season has already started in parts of Ontario.</p><p>\"Already we're seeing communities like Sudbury, Timmins and areas around the Georgian Bay placed under extreme fire warning,\" said Morrice.</p><p>As the climate emergency worsens, weather-related disasters like forest fires will become more severe and frequent - disproportionately impacting First Nations communities in the North, as well as people with precarious housing, said Morrice.</p><p>\"This is a matter of environmental injustice,\" said Morrice. \"(Premier) Doug Ford needs to wake up and take action on the climate emergency.\"</p><p>That means more funding to help municipalities prepare infrastructure for extreme weather, halting plans to reopen natural gas plants to generate electricity, and investing more in renewable energy, said Morrice.</p><p>As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme-weather events, they will continue to hurt communities across the province, he said.</p><p>\"Here in southern Ontario, we're already feeling the effects of the current fires - in smoky skies and poor air quality,\" said Morrice.</p><p>Terry Pender is a Waterloo Region-based general assignment reporter for The Record.

Fire officials are worried about a resurgence in two major fires because of a phenomenon known as \u201ccrossover.\u201d Wildfires can become extreme events when the temperature rises above 30 C, humidity dips below 30 per cent and wind speeds top 30 kilometres per hour \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what is expected to happen today. The two major fires that remain out of control \u2014 one in suburban Halifax, the other in the southwestern corner of the province \u2014 have already destroyed at least 200 homes and cottages. Still, fire officials announced this morning that 50 per cent fire near Hal-ifax had been contained and it had not grown since Wednesday. Despite that good news, officials say firefighters are now dealing with parched conditions, rising temperatures and mounting wind speeds, which will make for an unstable environment for wildfires.</p><p>\u201cWe are far from being out of the woods,\u201d David Steeves, a forest resources technician with Nova Scotia\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, told a briefing at a command post in Upper Tantallon, N.S. \u201cWe are still dealing with a very dangerous and volatile situation \u2026. We are looking at possibly fast and aggressive spread rates.\u201d Much of the province experienced a very mild winter with very little snowfall, and there hasn\u2019t been any significant rainfall in the past 12 days. As well, April was the driest month on record at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport. Another contributing factor has been the rapid growth of Atlantic Canada\u2019s largest city, which has experienced a building boom in recent years. The result has been the construction of large subdivisions on the outskirts of the city, where the backdrop is sprawling woodlands. In Ottawa, federal officials announced today that more than 300 firefighters from the United States and South Africa are heading to Canada to battle an unprecedented wildfire season.</p><p>At least 100 U.S.firefighters were expected to arrive in Nova Scotia over the weekend. And another 200 firefighters from South Africa will likely end up in Alberta. Meanwhile, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ask for help. In a letter released Wednesday, Houston said the province is looking for more water bombers and helicopters, and he submitted formal requests for firefighting foam, 5,000 hoses, four-wheel-drive trucks and assistance in establishing a base camp for 250 firefighters. Houston also wants advance access to the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Program, which typically does not kick in until the province has spent more than $3 million on disaster relief.</p><p>Ottawa announced Thursday it had approved Nova Scotia\u2019s plea for help, and the Canadian Armed Forces is preparing to provide extensive support, including help with logistics and resources. Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said that help will start arriving \u201chopefully\u201d by the end of the day. Environment Canada has issued warnings about poor air quality in Shelburne County, where a wildfire that started near Barrington Lake has become the largest forest fire in the province\u2019s history, now covering more than 170 square kilometres. In the town of Shelburne, all in-patients in the Roseway Hospital have be moved to other facilities and the hospital has been closed. Another air quality statement was issued for Upper Tantallon and Hammonds Plains, just outside Halifax, as the out-ofcontrol wildfire there was estimated at just over eight square kilometres in size. Cooler temperatures and steady rain aren\u2019t expected until late Friday. \u201cWe have our fingers crossed,\u201d said Steeves. \u201cWe need Mother Nature to get onside with us.\u201d Though the Atlantic region is better known for its soggy weather in the spring, Nova Scotia has recorded 201 wildfires this season, 28 of them in the past week alone. Those fires have so far burned 190 square kilometres of land.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20230602PTEA0003625217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CP-H631-JD2C-J1GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

That causes branches to break off trees. Sometimes, entire trees fall. Both increase the amount of dry tinder on the forest floor.<br/><br/> The ice- and wind-damaged forests are prone to more insect infestations, causing more trees to die and further increasing the amount of dead, dry wood.<br/><br/> \"Things like that are going to be an increasing risk,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> Wildfires in northern Alberta have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Thousands more had to evacuate in Halifax suburbs after a wildfire spread into a built-up area. <br/><br/> \"As you expand communities into forested areas because people love to live near forests, you are increasing your risk because you are putting more buildings in harm's way,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> The residential areas closest to forests and conservation areas are at a higher risk. <br/><br/> Homeowners can take simple precautions to protect their properties, said Evans. Do not pile firewood next to buildings, keep lawns cut, sweep decks clear of pine needles and leaves, cut down dead trees, and pick up dead branches and other organic material from the ground. If you can afford it, install a metal roof.<br/><br/> \"Fifty to 90 per cent of homes destroyed by wildfires are ignited by floating embers,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> It is very unlikely wildfires will ever hit cities like Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but smaller towns and villages in rural areas next to forests and large woodlots are at a higher risk, said Tom O'Hara, spokesperson for the Kitchener Fire Department.<br/><br/> \"Most of our urban centres here are not surrounded by dense bush and ground cover like up north, out west and out east,\" said O'Hara.<br/><br/> Kitchener firefighters have been able to quickly put out grass fires, he said.

That causes branches to break off trees. Sometimes, entire trees fall. Both increase the amount of dry tinder on the forest floor.<br/><br/> The ice- and wind-damaged forests are prone to more insect infestations, causing more trees to die and further increasing the amount of dead, dry wood.<br/><br/> \"Things like that are going to be an increasing risk,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> Wildfires in northern Alberta have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Thousands more had to evacuate in Halifax suburbs after a wildfire spread into a built-up area. <br/><br/> \"As you expand communities into forested areas because people love to live near forests, you are increasing your risk because you are putting more buildings in harm's way,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> The residential areas closest to forests and conservation areas are at a higher risk. <br/><br/> Homeowners can take simple precautions to protect their properties, said Evans. Do not pile firewood next to buildings, keep lawns cut, sweep <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2023/06/01/fire-at-kitchener-townhouse-complex-started-on-deck-before-quickly-spreading-to-rear-police.html\">decks</url> clear of pine needles and leaves, cut down dead trees, and pick up dead branches and other organic material from the ground. If you can afford it, install a metal roof.<br/><br/> \"Fifty to 90 per cent of homes destroyed by wildfires are ignited by floating embers,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> It is very unlikely wildfires will ever hit cities like Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but smaller towns and villages in rural areas next to forests and large woodlots are at a higher risk, said Tom O'Hara, spokesperson for the Kitchener Fire Department.<br/><br/> \"Most of our urban centres here are not surrounded by dense bush and ground cover like up north, out west and out east,\" said O'Hara.<br/><br/> Kitchener firefighters have been able to quickly put out grass fires, he said. Grass fires are reported early, and do not have the chance to grow into a multi-hectare blaze before firefighters arrive, said O'Hara.<br/><br/> The townships may impose a fire ban if there is no rain next week, said Wilmot Fire Chief Rod Leeson. The risk of a large grass fire or forest fire laying waste to housing in Wilmot is very low, but there is some risk, Leeson said.<br/><br/> \"There are some areas like Sunfish Lake which have permanent homes built in areas that are forested,\" said Leeson. <br/><br/> Governments must address the cause of climate change - the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels - or the fires will only get worse, said Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner.<br/><br/> Summer does not begin for nearly three weeks, but the burning season has already started in parts of Ontario.<br/><br/> \"Already we're seeing communities like Sudbury, Timmins and areas around the Georgian Bay placed under extreme fire warning,\" said Schreiner.<br/><br/> As the climate emergency worsens, weather-related disasters like forest fires will become more severe and frequent - disproportionately impacting First Nations communities in the North, as well as people with precarious housing, said Schreiner.<br/><br/> \"This is a matter of environmental injustice,\" said Schreiner. \"(Premier) Doug Ford needs to wake up and take action on the climate emergency.\"<br/><br/> That means more funding to help municipalities prepare infrastructure for extreme weather, halting plans to reopen natural gas plants to generate electricity, and investing more in renewable energy, said Schreiner.<br/><br/> As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme-weather events, they will continue to hurt communities across the province, he said.<br/><br/> \"Here in southern Ontario, we're already feeling the effects of the current fires - in smoky skies and poor air quality,\" said Schreiner.<br/><br/> Terry Pender is a Waterloo Region-based general assignment reporter for The Record.

Almost one-quarter of those fires are in Quebec, and Environment Canada warned wind patterns were causing smoke from some of those blazes to settle over the western part of the province as well as eastern Ontario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The smoke and fires prompted the cancellation of an Ironman triathlon race in Mont Tremblant, Que. shut down youth soccer and baseball programs in Ottawa and Montreal and compelled city officials in Ottawa and its neighbouring city of Gatineau, Que., to close outdoor pools and declare beaches off limits to swimming.</p><p>About 3,700 athletes were to take part in the triathlon at Quebec's popular resort about 130 km northwest of Montreal. But when they arrived Sunday morning, they found a coating of ash on their bicycles and a thick haze floating in the air.</p><p>\"In working with provincial health authorities due to the ash alert and high concentrations of fine particles causing poor Air Quality Index (AQI) spreading across the Tremblant region, we regret to share that Sunday\u2019s IRONMAN 70.3 Mont-Tremblant triathlon has been cancelled for the safety of all involved,\" race organizers posted on their website.</p><p>The record-breaking fire season and expectation of continued hot, dry weather has some cities also cancelling or reconsidering fireworks planned for Canada Day next weekend.</p><p>Gatineau disallowed fireworks planned for Saturday for the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday and is also barring them on July 1. North Bay, Ont. reported Friday it had considered cancelling fireworks for Canada Day but for now will allow them to go ahead.</p><p>North Bay was among the cities blanketed by smoke again Sunday.</p><p>Environment Canada said the air quality index in eastern and northern Ontario, including Ottawa, North Bay and Sudbury, was above 10 on Sunday, which is considered to be very high risk. Gatineau, Montreal and its suburbs were given the same rating.</p><p>Vulnerable people are advised to avoid strenuous outdoor exercise entirely while everyone else should severely limit it.</p><p>\"People with lung disease such as asthma, heart disease patients, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke,\" the weather agency said in its air quality warnings.</p><p>The agency said the air quality in Quebec City would also pose a high risk throughout Sunday. Winnipeg and the northern Manitoba town of Flin Flon may see high risk air quality Sunday afternoon and evening.</p><p>The poor air quality is expected to dissipate in Manitoba and northern Ontario by Monday but may remain above safe levels in eastern Ontario and western Quebec until at least Monday night.</p><p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said last week the biggest risk from wildfire smoke is the fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5 than settles in your lungs when inhaled and causes inflammation and irritation. </p><p>She said a well-fitted, high-quality face mask, like an N95, can help reduce the amount of PM2.5 someone inhales.</p><p>The number of fires actively burning has jumped over the last week. CIFFC reported 412 active fires with 208 out of control on June 18. Ontario and Alberta saw the biggest spikes in fire activity. </p><p>Nearly 72,000 square kilometres of forest land has burned this year so far, an area nearly four times the size of Lake Ontario.</p><p>There are differing reports on the exact record for the most amount of land burned from wildfires in a single year in Canada, but all indexes show this year is rapidly closing in on becoming the worst fire year the country has ever seen.</p><p>More than 13,000 square kilometres burned over the last seven days, or on average an area three times the size of the City of Toronto evach day.</p><p>The majority of fires in April and May were connected to human activities such as campfires. But 70 per cent of the 1,053 fires started since June 1 were caused by lightning strikes.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 25, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7bdf497ef77c4ff9994d81fc858e470f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JH-YTG1-DY9S-T38F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>04:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 25, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That's more than 220,000 soccer fields, or more than twice the area of New York City.</p><p>Northern Lao PDR experienced the greatest amount of forest encroachment, with around 5.7 million rai (2.2 million acres) converted to maize farms since 2015. Shan state in Myanmar lost 3.1 million rai (1.2 million acres) of forest, whereas northern Thailand lost 2.9 million rai (1.1 million acres) to maize cultivation.</p><p>'Mass maize farming is shifting from northern Thailand to Myanmar and Laos, where the political situation makes it more difficult for us to monitor and engage with local communities,' Tara explained.</p><p>According to Greenpeace, maize growing expanded by more than 38% between 2015 and 2023, from 13 million rai (5.1 million acres) to 18 million rai (7.1 million acres) - nearly the size of Belgium.</p><p>Maize Burning Hotspots</p><p>According to the survey, the hot spots - places with fires based on satellite data - in maize growing areas during the cultivation season increased from 31% in 2020 to 41% this year.</p><p>Forest fires were responsible for another 42% of this year's hot spot. The remainder was rice paddy and other crop plantation hotspots.</p><p>'Our study shows that the maize industry continues to play a key role in destroying forests in the Mekong sub region,' Tara added.</p><p>'It is also primarily to blame for the toxic air pollution that has become an annual occurrence.' It shouldn't have been a 'haze season' at the start of the year every year.'</p><p>Those responsible for worsening air pollution</p><p>According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand are among the top 30 countries with the worst air pollution.</p><p>According to EPIC's Air Quality Life Index, Myanmar's fine particle PM2.5 count was around 35 micrograms per cubic metre (g/m3), seven times higher than the World Health Organization's air quality recommendation.</p><p>PM2.5 levels in Lao PDR were around 27 g/m3, while in Thailand they were around 23 g/m3.</p><p>Toxic haze Chiang RaiThailand</p><p>Maize Burning a Major Factor to Northern Thailands' Toxic Haze</p><p>Earlier this year, toxic haze enveloped several parts in northern Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos for weeks due to out-of-control wildfires and agricultural burning, with more than 2 million people hospitalised in Thailand alone with respiratory difficulties.</p><p>According to experts, the region's crop cultivation season's deteriorating air pollution began around two decades ago, when Thailand imposed zero tariffs on maize imported from Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia to assist the cross-border contract farming programme.</p><p>Thailand is one of the world's major manufacturers of animal feed, as well as one of the largest producers of pig and poultry. Maize is the main ingredient, accounting for more than one-third of the animal feed.</p><p>Despite the haze, many maize farmers in the region continue to burn the remnants since it is the simplest way to remove the stubble before planting. Experts have told RFA that smallholder farmers should not be criticised only because they lack alternatives.</p><p>'We observe heavily indebted and disempowered farmers with weak land tenure, severe soil erosion, constantly engaged in land conflicts with the state, virtually forced to encroach on forests, and blamed by society for widespread air pollution at a regional level,' one research paper published this month in the journal Resources, Environment, and Sustainability said.</p><p>'In this system, the corporate players win, while farmers and the environment lose.'</p><p>Myanmar's maize cultivation</p><p>PM2.5 Dust Pollution at Toxic Levels in Chiang Rai, Thailand</p><p>Myanmar military officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment from RFA. Khun Thein Maung, Shan state's junta-appointed government spokeswoman, told RFA that local government officials from Myanmar and Thailand are discussing the problem.</p><p>'There was no burning on our side.' 'There is no proof,' he claimed, adding that maize plantation areas have risen by a few acres but have not 'doubled or tripled' to meet demand for local animal feed and foreign export.</p><p>'The residents profit from it. Farmers profit from their operations. It helps the region's socioeconomic life,' he stated, adding that no large agro-industry is engaged.</p><p>According to a Shan state-based environmental activist who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, maize farming expanded during the previous NLD administration.</p><p>'Shan state accounts for 49% of Myanmar's maize cultivation, accounting for 55% of total production.' 'However, little has been done to educate local farmers about shifting cultivation and stubble burning, which frequently causes forest fires,' he said.</p><p>In Laos, the 'government has taken strict measures to reduce slash-and-burn cultivation,' according to an official from Oudomxay Province's agriculture and forestry department.</p><p>'The provincial authorities in northern Laos have issued notices telling farmers to stop burning forest and to prevent the forest fire from spreading.'</p><p>The Thai government did not react to requests for comment from RFA, with some officials claiming that they are awaiting policy orders from the newly constituted government. The five Lower Mekong governments developed the Chiang Rai Plan of Action in 2020, with the goal of reducing hotspots by 30% and 40% by 2023 and 2025, respectively.</p><p>However, according to Greenpeace data, the number of hotspots has climbed slightly, from 161,728 in 2020 to 162,218 in 2023. Tara called it 'a complete policy failure' on the part of the administrations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES1709202300001004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696F-6JJ1-JCH9-G3NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 17, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

That causes branches to break off trees. Sometimes, entire trees fall. Both increase the amount of dry tinder on the forest floor.<br/><br/> The ice- and wind-damaged forests are prone to more insect infestations, causing more trees to die and further increasing the amount of dead, dry wood.<br/><br/> \"Things like that are going to be an increasing risk,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> Wildfires in northern Alberta have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Thousands more had to evacuate in Halifax suburbs after a wildfire spread into a built-up area. <br/><br/> \"As you expand communities into forested areas because people love to live near forests, you are increasing your risk because you are putting more buildings in harm's way,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> The residential areas closest to forests and conservation areas are at a higher risk. <br/><br/> Homeowners can take simple precautions to protect their properties, said Evans. Do not pile firewood next to buildings, keep lawns cut, sweep <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2023/06/01/fire-at-kitchener-townhouse-complex-started-on-deck-before-quickly-spreading-to-rear-police.html\">decks</url> clear of pine needles and leaves, cut down dead trees, and pick up dead branches and other organic material from the ground. If you can afford it, install a metal roof.<br/><br/> \"Fifty to 90 per cent of homes destroyed by wildfires are ignited by floating embers,\" said Evans.<br/><br/> It is very unlikely wildfires will ever hit cities like Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but smaller towns and villages in rural areas next to forests and large woodlots are at a higher risk, said Tom O'Hara, spokesperson for the Kitchener Fire Department.<br/><br/> \"Most of our urban centres here are not surrounded by dense bush and ground cover like up north, out west and out east,\" said O'Hara.<br/><br/> Kitchener firefighters have been able to quickly put out grass fires, he said. Grass fires are reported early, and do not have the chance to grow into a multi-hectare blaze before firefighters arrive, said O'Hara.<br/><br/> The townships may impose a fire ban if there is no rain next week, said Wilmot Fire Chief Rod Leeson. The risk of a large grass fire or forest fire laying waste to housing in Wilmot is very low, but there is some risk, Leeson said.<br/><br/> \"There are some areas like Sunfish Lake which have permanent homes built in areas that are forested,\" said Leeson. <br/><br/> Governments must address the cause of climate change - the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels - or the fires will only get worse, said Kitchener Centre MPP Mike Morrice.<br/><br/> Summer does not begin for nearly three weeks, but the burning season has already started in parts of Ontario.<br/><br/> \"Already we're seeing communities like Sudbury, Timmins and areas around the Georgian Bay placed under extreme fire warning,\" said Morrice.<br/><br/> As the climate emergency worsens, weather-related disasters like forest fires will become more severe and frequent - disproportionately impacting First Nations communities in the North, as well as people with precarious housing, said Morrice.<br/><br/> \"This is a matter of environmental injustice,\" said Morrice. \"(Premier) Doug Ford needs to wake up and take action on the climate emergency.\"<br/><br/> That means more funding to help municipalities prepare infrastructure for extreme weather, halting plans to reopen natural gas plants to generate electricity, and investing more in renewable energy, said Morrice.<br/><br/> As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme-weather events, they will continue to hurt communities across the province, he said.<br/><br/> \"Here in southern Ontario, we're already feeling the effects of the current fires - in smoky skies and poor air quality,\" said Morrice.<br/><br/> Terry Pender is a Waterloo Region-based general assignment reporter for The Record.

Both increase the amount of dry tinder on the forest floor.</p><p>The ice- and wind-damaged forests are prone to more insect infestations, causing more trees to die and further increasing the amount of dead, dry wood.</p><p>\"Things like that are going to be an increasing risk,\" said Evans.</p><p>Wildfires in northern Alberta have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Thousands more had to evacuate in Halifax suburbs after a wildfire spread into a built-up area.</p><p>\"As you expand communities into forested areas because people love to live near forests, you are increasing your risk because you are putting more buildings in harm's way,\" said Evans.</p><p>The residential areas closest to forests and conservation areas are at a higher risk.</p><p>Homeowners can take simple precautions to protect their properties, said Evans. Do not pile firewood next to buildings, keep lawns cut, sweep decks clear of pine needles and leaves, cut down dead trees, and pick up dead branches and other organic material from the ground. If you can afford it, install a metal roof.</p><p>\"Fifty to 90 per cent of homes destroyed by wildfires are ignited by floating embers,\" said Evans.</p><p>It is very unlikely wildfires will ever hit cities like Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but smaller towns and villages in rural areas next to forests and large woodlots are at a higher risk, said Tom O'Hara, spokesperson for the Kitchener Fire Department.</p><p>\"Most of our urban centres here are not surrounded by dense bush and ground cover like up north, out west and out east,\" said O'Hara.</p><p>Kitchener firefighters have been able to quickly put out grass fires, he said. Grass fires are reported early, and do not have the chance to grow into a multi-hectare blaze before firefighters arrive, said O'Hara.</p><p>The townships may impose a fire ban if there is no rain next week, said Wilmot Fire Chief Rod Leeson. The risk of a large grass fire or forest fire laying waste to housing in Wilmot is very low, but there is some risk, Leeson said.</p><p>\"There are some areas like Sunfish Lake which have permanent homes built in areas that are forested,\" said Leeson.</p><p>Governments must address the cause of climate change - the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels - or the fires will only get worse, said Kitchener Centre MPP Mike Morrice.</p><p>Summer does not begin for nearly three weeks, but the burning season has already started in parts of Ontario.</p><p>\"Already we're seeing communities like Sudbury, Timmins and areas around the Georgian Bay placed under extreme fire warning,\" said Morrice.</p><p>As the climate emergency worsens, weather-related disasters like forest fires will become more severe and frequent - disproportionately impacting First Nations communities in the North, as well as people with precarious housing, said Morrice.</p><p>\"This is a matter of environmental injustice,\" said Morrice. \"(Premier) Doug Ford needs to wake up and take action on the climate emergency.\"</p><p>That means more funding to help municipalities prepare infrastructure for extreme weather, halting plans to reopen natural gas plants to generate electricity, and investing more in renewable energy, said Morrice.</p><p>As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme-weather events, they will continue to hurt communities across the province, he said.</p><p>\"Here in southern Ontario, we're already feeling the effects of the current fires - in smoky skies and poor air quality,\" said Morrice.</p><p>Terry Pender is a Waterloo Region-based general assignment reporter for The Record.</p><p>Reach him via email:</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tpender@therecord.com\">tpender@therecord.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-news20230602TRK2023060268062541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CD-79M1-F197-510B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

We are looking at possibly fast and aggressive spread rates.\"</p><p>Much of the province experienced a very mild winter with very little snowfall, and there hasn't been any significant rainfall in the past 12 days. As well, April was the driest month on record at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport.</p><p>Another contributing factor has been the rapid growth of Atlantic Canada's largest city, which has experienced a building boom in recent years. The result has been the construction of large subdivisions on the outskirts of the city, where the backdrop is sprawling woodlands.</p><p>In Ottawa, federal officials announced today that more than 300 firefighters from the United States and South Africa are heading to Canada to battle an unprecedented wildfire season.</p><p>At least 100 U.S. firefighters were expected to arrive in Nova Scotia over the weekend. And another 200 firefighters from South Africa will likely end up in Alberta.</p><p>READ MORE: About 200 homes, structures destroyed in Halifax wildfire, taking toll on residents</p><p>Meanwhile, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ask for help.</p><p>In a letter released Wednesday, Houston said the province is looking for more water bombers and helicopters, and he submitted formal requests for firefighting foam, 5,000 hoses, four-wheel-drive trucks and assistance in establishing a base camp for 250 firefighters.</p><p>Houston also wants advance access to the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Program, which typically does not kick in until the province has spent more than $3 million on disaster relief.</p><p>Ottawa announced Thursday it had approved Nova Scotia's plea for help, and the Canadian Armed Forces is preparing to provide extensive support, including help with logistics and resources.

The buildings had been abandoned and derelict for 60 years, when the Friends of Wells Gray Park and BC Parks co-funded a restoration project.</p><p>The Stillwater Road turns right off the Clearwater Valley Road at km 35.7, just south of the park entrance. The road descends to Blackwater Creek, then climbs up the other side of the valley. The trailhead to the Bee Farm is signed at km 3.5.</p><p>A hike of less than 10 minutes leads to Smith Lake which is 400 m long at an elevation of 750 m. The trail skirts the lake on the right or south side, then goes over undulating terrain with a gradual descent to the next junction. Here, follow the left fork which soon reaches a collapsed bridge over Hemp Creek.</p><p>Continue upstream along Hemp Creek for about 30 minutes to reach the Bee Farm. The three main structures are the cabin, bee shed and outhouse.</p><p>The Bee Farm is the story of two remarkable sisters, Jessie and Frances Emery. Jessie was born on Aug. 16, 1910 and Frances on May 23, 1913. Eventually, the family had nine children and they moved from Alberta to East Blackpool near Clearwater in 1922. The girls' father, Ernest, had invested in some bees and Jessie gradually took over his beekeeping tasks as she got older.</p><p>In the summer of 1926, life in Upper Clearwater took a dramatic change when a huge forest fire swept through the valley. Large burned tracts of land created by the fire were soon covered in fireweed, willow and other deciduous shrubs. Ernest died in 1928 and, by 1930, the Great Depression was taking hold on western Canada.</p><p>Jessie still managed to earn a small income from her six beehives on the Blackpool farm. The bee inspector told her about the vast fields of fireweed growing in the Hemp Creek Valley, thanks to the fire of 1926. In Upper North Thompson Reflections, Frances described how she and Jessie, assisted by older brother Norman and younger brother Ralph, relocated their beekeeping operation:</p><p>Jessie filed for a homestead there in 1930 when we were 20 and 17, and we moved the bees to the Upper Clearwater Valley. Norman and Jessie built the cabin while Ralph and I split shakes and helped any way we could. There were beautiful cedar trees that had been killed by the fire but not really burned. What lumber we needed was split from them.</p><p>Any other materials needed had to be packed to the Bee Farm, as the end of the road in 1930 was near Trout Creek.</p><p>The Canadian Association of Palynologists estimates that, to produce one pound of honey, bees must visit two million flowers, fly about 80,000 km and carry about 37,000 loads of nectar back to the hive. During peak flower blooming periods, bees from a single hive may visit up to 250,000 flowers in a single day. With such activity, a beekeeper's job continues year-round and, in the case of the Emery sisters, they had to hike quite a distance into the wilderness to tend their bees.</p><p>In spring, the hives' winter insulation was unwrapped, food supplies checked and dead colonies removed. If the queen was productive, the hive filled quickly with brood and honey and could run out of space, causing swarming. This was prevented by adding extra shelves (or supers), giving more space for honey production. In summer, honey was removed, processed and packed. During fall, the colony's health and strength had to be checked again because weak or diseased hives would be unlikely to survive the winter.</p><p>The sisters also had to protect their hives from invading animals because bee larvae and honey were a delicacy for bears, skunks and raccoons. In winter, the girls also had to check the hives regularly because the bees could suffocate if the entrance to the hives was blocked by a heavy snowfall. Charlie Ludtke recalled that his brother Fred had a trapline near the Bee Farm and he cleared away the snow from the hives when he went by.</p><p>After they had set up their beekeeping operation among the fields of fireweed, the Bee Girls realized they needed to expand, so they doubled their hives to 12 and began to enjoy even more plentiful honey harvests. They sold their honey for up to 18 cents per pound locally. With each of the 12 hives producing 200 to 250 pounds of honey, the girls could make as much as $540 per year.</p><p>Their business was flourishing.</p><p>The Shook family arrived in the Clearwater Valley in 1934 with nine children and homesteaded near Grouse Creek. Two of the boys were Floyd and Roy. Frances Emery recalled, \"On March 1, 1934, Jessie and I headed for the Bee Farm to clean up the bee supers. On the way, we picked up the mail for the valley settlers and, while we were delivering it, we met Floyd and Roy Shook.\"</p><p>Soon the brothers arrived at the Bee Farm where they helped the girls finish some of the buildings and built a bee house for the hives. The romance developed from there. Frances married Floyd in 1936 and Jessie married Roy the following year. Two weeks after that wedding, Roy and Floyd's sister Freda married Frances and Jessie's brother Ralph, creating a triple relationship between two families of nine children.</p><p>Jessie and Frances kept the Bee Farm operating until about 1940. They did most of the work themselves because Roy and Floyd were busy on the homesteads and not too interested in bees after all. Both had young children and trips to the Bee Farm entailed packing children along too. In addition, the forest was gradually growing again after the fire and replacing the once-abundant fireweed with other plants. The hives were brought out from the Bee Farm about 1945. Jessie kept a few hives at home until she was in her sixties.</p><p>Roy Shook owned several small sawmills and the family moved frequently between mill sites. Jessie was kept busy with their five children, her wonderful gardens, and her beehives. They retired in Barnhartvale, a suburb of Kamloops. Jessie died in 1991 and Roy in 1999. Frances and Floyd raised four children and moved to Vavenby in 1947, then to Barriere, Louis Creek and back to Vavenby in 1960. Frances returned to the Bee Farm only once, with her brother-in-law Charlie, when she was 80. Charlie wrote about this event:</p><p>Fifty-four years after leaving the Bee Farm, Frances Shook came back\u2026 Frances' greatest fear was that her old home would be dilapidated, but she was pleasantly surprised at what she saw. The lilac bush still grows strongly and blooms well, a big reward for backpacking in its first beginnings and giving it loving care 60 years ago.</p><p>Floyd died in 1981 and Frances in 2001, just before her 88th birthday.</p><p>Seventy years after the Emery sisters established their Bee Farm, an examination of the buildings revealed their deteriorating condition. Comprehensive restoration was completed in 2001, co-funded by B.C. Parks and the Friends of Wells Gray Park. The project was partly finished when the Friends organized an interpretive hike to the Bee Farm in July 2001. Joining the group were all four of Frances' children (the first time they had been there as adults) and two of Jessie's children, a remarkable family reunion.</p><p>A journalist, Nigel Pooley, visited the Bee Girls in 1938 and wrote a story about them which was published in the Family Herald &amp; Weekly Star on January 18, 1939. It gives some slightly different facts about the amazing story of Jessie and Frances Shook, but is reproduced here in its entirety.</p><p>- Above is an excerpt from Exploring Wells Gray Park, written by Roland Neave.

The fire suddenly flared on Monday.</p><p>While Rose said he initially felt safe from his vantage point on the eastern side of the lake, he and his partner decided to get out Tuesday, just as an evacuation order covering the more than 200 properties around the lake was issued.</p><p>The order was quickly upgraded to critical, urging the seasonal and permanent residents to leave for Lillooet or Whistler.</p><p>Evacuation alerts were also extended to areas north of Gun Lake, including Tyaughton Lake and the Tyax Resort, as the nearly 18-square-kilometre fire almost quadrupled in size since Monday.</p><p>Rose said his father's cabin has been in his family since 1945 and it is where he spent his childhood summers.</p><p>\"There was always the fear of lightning (and) there was always a fear of a campfire setting off a forest fire and destroying the incredible natural beauty around that lake, so that's always been a fear in the back of our heads and now it's actually happened,\" he said.</p><p>He said the fire has burned family traditions and heritage to the ground.</p><p>\"So, this is the first time in my 52 years that I've ever actually seen it. And it ended up close. So, it has this sort of sense of 'Lord of the Rings' of devastation,\" Rose said of watching the fire destroy the homes on the opposite side of the lake.</p><p>Rose's father, 81-year-old John Rose, said in a previous interview that he intended to stay as long as possible to keep the sprinklers running on the roof of their log house and on the heritage cabins on the neighbouring property built by his parents in the 1940s.</p><p>\"This isn't heroic,\" said John Rose, a retired BC Parks Service ranger. \"I just don't think anyone else could handle this set up.\"</p><p>Owen Rose said his father has since reassessed the situation and left the property on Wednesday. He said their cabin was still standing and he hopes it stays that way.</p><p>\"It's three generations and memories that are there. That would be the greatest loss. It's a massive psychological loss if they were to go,\" he said.</p><p>Wildfire Service director of operations Cliff Chapman told a news conference Wednesday that hot and dry conditions are likely to persist and strong winds will continue to pose a challenge on the fire lines.</p><p>\"The conditions at Gun Lake specifically are quite challenging with the steep terrain, so we are utilizing our aviation assets. We have ground resources on that fire including structure protection, but also fire suppression crews,\" he said.</p><p>He couldn't confirm the number of homes lost to the fire.</p><p>\"The plan will be to continue to try to protect the structures around Gun Lake and ideally try to steer that fire away from the structures and communities while the conditions persist and make it very challenging for us to actually suppress the fire.\"</p><p>The Gun Lake fire is among about 360 active wildfires across B.C., including 14 that the B.C. Wildfire Service says were sparked since Tuesday.</p><p>The destroyed homes, evacuation orders and alerts came as most residents of the southern Okanagan town of Osoyoos were returning to their homes after a wildfire raced north from Washington state on Saturday, burning to within metres of some properties before a wind shift spared the community.</p><p>The flare up of the Downton Lake blaze happened just as the young Ontario firefighter who died last week in northeastern B.C., was identified as 25-year-old Zak Muise.</p><p>Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma told the news conference that about 530 people at more than 500 properties are under evacuation order across B.C., and more than 9,500 people at 4,100 properties are under evacuation alert.</p><p>As of Wednesday, Ma said 23 of the province's 34 water basins are in drought Level 4 or 5, meaning harm to ecosystems and communities is likely and efforts should be made to conserve water and protect critical environmental flows.</p><p>\"It's important that our extreme drought situation is not overshadowed by the ongoing wildfire situation,\" Ma said.</p><p>\"That's why it's incredibly important that everyone, including businesses, follow all local water restrictions,\" she said. \"Every drop counts.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: 'It's heavy': Firefighter deaths weighing on B.C. wildfire crews</p><p>READ ALSO: August can be the most challenging month for B.C. wildfires, says Ma</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20230802PAB4498795</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VK-FFS1-F0HF-822B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

It's going to get windy here and we're expecting some extreme wildfire behaviour,\u201d Christie Tucker, information unit manager, Alberta Wildfire in a press conference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time of the press conference, Tucker said there were 78 wildfires burning in the province, and 19 of those fires have recently been listed as out of control. </p><p>Tucker gave an update on priority wildfires that they will focus on. </p><p>The Drayton Valley wildfire is currently out of control and is 1,500 hectares in size.   </p><p>Officials announced evacuations last night after wildfire activity was seen across the river. </p><p>\u201cIt's currently burning inside the river valley between the river and HWY 22, seven km from the south edge of Drayton Valley. It is grown 20 hectares on that side of the river today,\u201d she said. </p><p>Currently, there are 26 firefighters, three helicopters, and air tankers working on the fire. </p><p>The Fox Lake fire is also out of control at 4,400 hectares. </p><p>\u201cThere's a type one incident management team on that fire,\u201d she said. </p><p>There were 115 people were evacuated using two helicopters on Thursday. </p><p>There are 36 firefighter, three helicopters, air tankers, and heavy equipment \u201cworking to control the fire.\u201d </p><p>Tucker said they were able to use night vision technology to fight the wildfire around the clock. </p><p>Rainbow Lake is also a priority fire; however, Tucker said it is moving away from the community, \u201cbut it's still significant priority for firefighters.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have a few new starts that we are watching, and we are going to make sure that we have enough resources today to share them where the priorities are as they develop,\u201d she said. </p><p>There are 79 firefighters coming into the province from Ontario and Quebec and through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center. </p><p>\u201cWe have requests for more assistance as well,\u201d she said. </p><p>Tucker said today\u2019s weather conditions are expected to be very warm with extremely strong winds, particularly in the northern half of the province. </p><p>\"There is a fire ban and an off-highway vehicle restriction across the Forest Protection Area now in place,\" she said. </p><p>Restrictions announced today mean people cannot have open wood fires on public or private land, or in their backyard. </p><p>Tucker said if Albertans want to find out exactly what bans and restrictions are in place, visit Albertafirebans.ca. </p><p>\u201cThat will have the most up to date information about any bands in place, and what you can and cannot do in the forest protection area or outside in Alberta,\u201d she said. </p><p>Since Jan. 1, 2023 there has been a total of 348 wildfires in the province.  </p><p>\u201cIt's burned more than 2,500 hectares of land. That significantly more wildfire activity for this time of year than we've certainly seen any time in the recent past,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cThe conditions are ripe for a wildfire to start and spread very quickly,\u201d she said. </p><p>Stephen Lacroix, managing director, Alberta Emergency Management Agency issued a warning to Albertans who have active fires in their areas. </p><p>\u201cPlease listen to all officials or local officials and obey any evacuation orders you may receive. Follow the Alberta emergency alert application and website and your local municipality for recreation information and available services,\u201d he said. </p><p>Lacroix said Alberta 511 provides up to date highway closures and conditions. </p><p>\u201cWe're working with federal, provincial and municipal partners to deliver emergency support throughout this evolving and extremely fluid situation,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1ad8b684a69e40c5ba0923966899761b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:685N-F9D1-JBVR-302T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><timeReceived>05:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 5, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These shifts, combined with forestry policies and climate change effects, greatly increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire.\u201d-Keith Atkinson, Chair, BC Forest Practices Board (BCFPB) Forestry experts have long warned that forest practices and government policies are intensifying wildfire risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But industry and government have disregarded numerous studies and persistent calls for action. Practices and policies are little changed.</p><p>The results have been disastrous as expanses of forest, extensive infrastructure and numerous homes have been razed, and as the air has been fouled and fire suppression costs have multiplied. Increasingly, wildfire ravages more land in less time.</p><p>On June 26, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Service, reported that over 7,600,000 hectares had burned in Canada to date in 2023. That surpassed the previous annual record of 7,560,000 hectares in 1989.</p><p>Six months of 2023 saw more area destroyed than 12 months of the record year. The average fire in 2023 was four times larger than in 1989. Extreme fire seasons have been common this century.</p><p>In British Columbia to July 4, 2023, 621 fires burned 1,042,000 hectares.</p><p>In the record year of 2018, 1,354,000 hectares were lost to 2,117 fires. The area burned this year is almost certainly on track to exceed the record year, with most of the two peak fire months yet to be added to the tally.</p><p>It is also likely that BC\u2019s loss to wildfire will top 2 million hectares. Some hope remains that extensive summer rain will intervene, but not much.</p><p>The BCFPB on June 29 released their report, \u201cForest and Fire Management in B.C\u201d. The report relates that the 2021 wildfire season resulted in $800 million in fire suppression costs and indirect costs as high as $24 billion.</p><p>Costs include damage to private property and infrastructure and extensive loss of soil productivity, timber supply and wildlife habitat. Since 2018, the province has spent $72 million on fuel reduction measures, says the report, \u201calmost exclusively\u201d within the wildland urban interface (WUI).</p><p>The budget for mitigation is dwarfed by fire suppression costs, and is almost non-existent relative to the extensive costs of wildfire, as areas impacted and severity of impact greatly expand.</p><p>The largest fire in B.C. history now rages in B.C. \u2019s far north. The Donnie Creek Wildfire, at over 570,000 hectares, has burned an area equivalent to that of B.C. \u2019s entire fifth largest fire season.</p><p>It is expected to continue to burn through to the end of the season. The destruction of timber and wildlife habitat is already immense.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a professor of fire science at Thompson River University, told the CBC that without climate change this fire season would have been impossible.</p><p>\u201cThe warmer it gets, the more efficient the atmosphere is at sucking the moisture of the fuels \u2026 on the forest floor,\u201d he noted. BC forest scientists fear a loss in the diversity of tree species, and expect vast forested areas will be replaced by grasslands.</p><p>Flanigan co-authored a study concluding, \u201cDryer and warmer weather, will increase the incidence of short-interval reburning and amplify the ecological changes such events cause, as wildfire activity and postfire drought increase synergistically.\u201d</p><p>This demands rapid action by government and industry.</p><p>Promisingly, techniques to mitigate risks in forests and reduce wildfire events exist. Governments need only adopt them, and of course pay for them.</p><p>Forestry experts recommend that fuel reduction measures must be expanded and targeted beyond the WUI. Provincial policy and regulation should require all areas harvested to be reforested, not just with the most economically viable species, but with those species native to the area to improve resilience.</p><p>Destructive forestry activities, like widespread salvage logging after disasters, should be prohibited. These measures and others provide only part of the solution.</p><p>The BCFPB report recommends \u2013 more accurately, urges \u2013 a comprehensive approach called landscape fire management (LFM).</p><p>\u201cLFM is a way to proactively mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on the broader landscape.</p><p>\u201cIt is a restoration approach to addressing forest fuel buildup and improving landscape resilience,\u201d the report reads. \u201cAchieving this paradigm shift will require bold and immediate action by the provincial government to align policies and programs across all levels of government with a vision of landscape resilience and co-existence with fire.\u201d</p><p>LFM will require major effort and a significant budget.</p><p>Should the BC government continue to avoid the responsibility and the expense, the environment and economy of this province will be irretrievably damaged.</p><p>Bruce Uzelman is a political columnist living in the Okanagan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-news20230713PPQA0003726163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68P9-F6S1-JD2C-J0DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

against the province's wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma said Thursday she had also spoken to her counterpart in Ottawa, Bill Blair, about bringing more federal resources to help fight the 350 or so fires burning across B.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ma said at a briefing about drought conditions in B.C. that a team from Australia is arriving on Saturday, adding to the 160 international personnel from Mexico and the United States currently deployed in B.C.</p><p>She said the Australians are an \"incident management team.\"</p><p>Firefighters from South Korea, France, South Africa and the Dominican Republic have also been fighting fires in Canada, during what is shaping up as a record-breaking fire season.</p><p>Blair, federal minister of emergency preparedness, had earlier said he was expecting a \"fairly substantive\" request for help from B.C. as wildfires worsen.</p><p>Blair told The Canadian Press the government operations centre has been in discussions with the province for the last several days, and Ottawa is ready to deploy needed resources.</p><p>\"The fire season now is obviously sparking up pretty seriously out there and they have sent us an indication of some additional resources that they will require,\" he said in an interview Thursday.</p><p>\"For the last 48 hours we've been working with Canadian Armed Forces, Parks Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and people from the Canadian Coast Guard,\" said Blair. \"There's a lot of different federal departments all mobilizing their response to the requirements of British Columbia.\"</p><p>He said the federal help could include military assistance for airlift evacuations from remote locations, as well as members of the military trained as firefighters who can provide \"mop up\" to keep blazes from reigniting once they've been put out.</p><p>\"If there are communities that become isolated and need to be evacuated, then Canadian Armed Forces provides those resources,\" Blair said.</p><p>The Canadian Coast Guard is also mobilizing support for affected coastal communities, and Natural Resources Canada staff with forest management expertise are also preparing to help, he said.</p><p>Blair added there are a number of national parks in B.C., so Parks Canada is ready to aid the province with park firefighters and forest management experts.</p><p>Blair said B.C. is one of the better equipped provinces to handle fires because it is often among the hardest hit, but any extra help needed is being made available.</p><p>Ma's request for more international help was lodged through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which co-ordinates firefighting resources across the country.</p><p>Premier David Eby said earlier this week the province was looking for more firefighting support, particularly air equipment, in its battle against wildfires.</p><p>He said forecasts suggest B.C. and Canada could be facing the worst fire season in 100 years.</p><p>Eby expressed gratitude for the help provided by international firefighters from Mexico and the United States who are on the frontlines with provincial crews.</p><p>Rural and northern B.C. communities have felt the brunt of this year's wildfire season, but on Wednesday, smoke from a blaze on the mountains overlooking Vancouver could be seen across the city, as helicopters dropped water to extinguish the flames.</p><p>Brant Arnold-Smith, director of the Metro Vancouver regional district's emergency operations centre, said at a media briefing Thursday that crews were still tackling hot spots, saying the fire in North Vancouver's Seymour conservation area is deep underground.</p><p>\"We are quite confident that it will not spread anymore,\" he said.</p><p>Arnold-Smith said their initial theory suggested it was caused by lightning, but they're not ruling out that it was human caused until an investigation is done.</p><p>But he said the fire was in a \"rugged, secluded area\" where people rarely trek, taking an hour and a half for crews to reach the scene through thick brush.</p><p>\"This event serves as an important reminder as to how dry our region is,\" he said. \"It's been almost a month of just no precipitation in the region, so our green spaces are very dry and very susceptible to any sort of ignition sources that could cause a wildfire.</p><p>There are more than 350 wildfires burning in all corners of the province, and the BC Wildfire Service warns another blast of heat in many areas could add more burdens on already overstretched crews.</p><p>The wildfire service says a week-old, 300-square-kilometre blaze close to Highway 37 just south of the Yukon boundary has been calm, but it and similar fires across northern B.C. could flare up during the next several days of expected hot weather.</p><p>READ ALSO: 'Deeply concerning': 22 of B.C.'s 34 water basins facing severe drought levels</p><p>Copyright 2023

The weather was making it harder to maintain control of fires that had been contained, she told reporters Thursday in Quebec City. </p><p>Since the start of the week, four fires that had been contained were out of control again, she added.</p><p>\"Of course, there's the risk of new fires breaking out, which is also serious,\" she said. \"The large amount of smoke can make tanker plane operations difficult, that was the case for the last two days.\"</p><p>Coupal said fire officials have asked for more resources from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which co-ordinates mutual aid between provincial and territorial wildland fire agencies, adding that firefighters who came from Spain and Portugal to help the province were scheduled to return home next week. </p><p>In Ottawa, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Thursday that the federal government extended the deployment of Canadian Armed Forces members helping to fight the wildfires in Quebec. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 22, 2023.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Marie-\u00c8ve Martel in Montreal. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-05fc7d36df2a428c9f746e0032839af3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HX-2HN1-JBVR-34FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>11:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 22, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As of June 8, 137 fires were active across the province, most out of control, down from 149 the previous day as cooler weather and firefighting reinforcements began taming some of the blazes. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After fires breached a preventative barrier and was just 17 km away, Ouje-Bougoumou and Chibougamau residents were ordered to evacuate June 6. Buses transported people 400 km southeast to the C\u00e9gep de Chicoutimi, while vehicles lined the only highway towards Lac Saint-Jean. Some headed instead to Mistissini.  </p><p>Forest fire protection organization SOPFEU was using aerial tankers to fight the fire, which was moving west of the community. He said forecasts that winds were expected to shift to come from the south would be helpful to their efforts. </p><p>\u201cSOPFEU\u2019s plan is to burn some of the forest so there will be no fuel for the fire when the wind direction changes,\u201d said Ouje-Bougoumou Chief Curtis Bosum June 8. \u201cThese efforts, combined with the impact of the swampy area on the fire and our protective barrier on the east side of the community may all prove to be effective.\u201d </p><p>The barrier perimeter on the east side of the community was 40 metres wide. Residents were advised not to return home as the heavy smoke caused by the water bombers is very hazardous to health. Local police force Lieutenant Robert Mianscum said EEPF officers had evacuated remaining people and set up roadblocks and patrols to ensure safety. </p><p>On June 7, Waswanipi began relocating vulnerable people to Quebec City\u2019s ExpoCit\u00e9 convention centre in a \u201cpre-evacuation\u201d phase, including those with chronic illness, infants and pregnant women. Chief Irene Neeposh advised residents to prepare an evacuation bag, keep their cars gassed up and plan their route to safety.  </p><p>Nearly 300 Waswanipi residents had been evacuated as of June 8. Other evacuations were happening in several communities, including Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, Normetal and parts of Val-d\u2019Or. Many across the province were voluntarily leaving their homes because of heavy smoke in the air. </p><p>Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano reassured residents that their community was safe but recommended only using essential power as the primary line into the community was damaged in the fire. Electricity in the community was going on and off throughout June 7. </p><p>\u201cConserve your gas, walk when it\u2019s not smoky,\u201d urged Petawabano. \u201cWe are asking people not to consume alcohol, consider the essential workers. Essential services, food and gas are available. They will not be blocked from entering the community.\u201d </p><p>The Cree Nation Government had earlier issued a travel advisory warning, recommending travel to bush camps be avoided as the shifting winds could quickly change the status of a fire. It advised people to be alert to local communications and follow instructions provided by public safety services. </p><p>\u201cI was worried about my grandmother because she was in the bush and there was a lot of smoke,\u201d Raven Icebound Lord told the Nation. As her mother had already evacuated with a full carload, Icebound Lord called her uncle to check on her, who travelled from Mistissini to pick her up in Waswanipi on the way to Lac Saint-Jean. </p><p>The unprecedented extent of wildfires across Quebec had consumed over 638,000 hectares as of June 8 with winds carrying hazardous smoke to Montreal and cities throughout the northeastern United States. After suffering its worst air-quality readings on record, New York City provided a million free masks to residents.  </p><p>\u201cWe recommend for people going outdoors to wear an N-95 mask like we had for Covid,\u201d said Dr. Catherine Dickson, a public health physician with the Cree Health Board. \u201cThese are designed to filter particles from the smoke out. We\u2019re looking to identify public buildings for setting up clean air shelters.\u201d </p><p>Dickson explained that particles from the smoke can get into the lungs, especially for people with other health conditions, making your heart work faster to keep the oxygen exchanging in the body. The stress caused by the uncertainty was also a concern for mental health. </p><p>While rainy conditions began reducing the state of emergency in eastern Quebec on June 7, northern Quebec remained dry with no rain forecast until June 12. As firefighting resources arrived from as far away as Portugal, Mexico and Spain, officials said no other evacuations are planned in the short term and it\u2019s too soon to say when people may return home. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-06d92e4bc64744a29ba74f38a00b9a3f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HG-3WY1-DY9S-T4V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>06:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 20, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No open air burning, including campfires, is permitted within the boundaries of a Restricted Fire Zone. Portable gas or propane stoves may be used for cooking and warmth BUT must be handled with extreme caution. All burning permits are suspended. The Restricted Fire Zone is in place until further notice. It is illegal to set an open fire within the affected area. Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to $25,000 and three months in jail. The Restricted Fire Zone was lifted as of 4 p.m. on Tuesday, July 11. </p><p><br/><br/> The 2023 fire danger rating is in effect for the Almaguin and North Bay areas. The fire season runs from April 1 to Oct. 31 each year.<br/><br/> The fire danger rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index, an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types.<br/><br/> For the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Fire Danger Rating, visit click here.

In the 2022 wildfire season, 56 per cent of wildfires were caused by human activity, around 38 per cent were caused by lightning and roughly six per cent are still under investigation.</p><p>While the wildfire season in the province officially ended on Oct. 31, officials still ask Albertans to be cautious as the threat of wildfires lingers in the province.</p><p>\u201cDiligence this summer resulted in a more than 10 per cent decrease in human-caused wildfires and we recorded fewer wildfires than the previous year overall,\u201d said Todd Loewen, Minister of Forestry, Parks and Tourism.</p><p>\u201cWildfire staff work tirelessly keeping our forests safe and it\u2019s great to see that their efforts have been supported by the public\u2019s responsible behaviour. We\u2019re not out of the woods yet, though \u2013warm, dry fall conditions in some parts of the province mean that it\u2019s still important for folks to stay alert to risks. Preventing wildfire is the duty of all Albertans.\u201d</p><p>Overall this year, a total of 1,254 wildfires burned about 153,124 hectares. This is compared with the five-year average (2017-2021) of 1,110 wildfires burning more than 190,000 hectares.</p><p>Alberta was able to aid firefighting efforts in British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Alaska and Washington, and supported Parks Canada and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The province sent 90 firefighters, overhead staff and aircraft to partner agencies in need.</p><p>According to the Alberta government, since January 1, there have been 78 wildfires in the Rocky Mountain House Forest Area which have burned 557 hectares.</p><p>RWF075 was detected on October 20, 2022 and is classified as being held at 35 ha. The wildfire is approximately 10km east of Abraham Lake.</p><p>The Black Mountain Fire was discovered on July 19 and is located 19 km west of Nordegg.

A new video made by Kaslo students participating in the Wildsight Youth Climate Corps program shows this work being done with the plumes of smoke rising in the background. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cJust as we\u2019re working on this project, there\u2019s actually a forest fire about 10 kilometres away from Kaslo and we\u2019re experiencing ash and burnt pine needles falling on the road, on our homes,\u201d said Kaslo youth Raya Prytuluk in the opening of the short film. \u201cYou can definitely feel it in the air, you can smell it and it\u2019s been very smoky and you can see visible flames as well.\u201d </p><p>About 40 Kaslo community members viewed the film while gathered at Kaslo\u2019s Legion Hall on November 21 for a FireSmart open house organized by the Village of Kaslo FireSmart Committee. This was ideally going to take place in the summer as people still had the opportunity to do work on their property, but the Briggs Creek fire had most of those involved pretty occupied. </p><p>\u201cWe wanted to do it in the summer,\u201d said organizer Avery Deboer-Smith from Cathro Consulting. \u201cBut everyone here was busy out in the forest.\u201d </p><p>Homeowners are encouraged to FireSmart their property by doing everything from cleaning up sticks and flammable objects in their yards to changing the types of siding and roofing used on homes. </p><p>Presentations were given by representatives of the Regional District of Central Kootenay, the Village of Kaslo, the Kaslo &amp; District Community Forest, and John Cathro of Cathro Consulting, who works with the Village on wildfire resiliency measures. </p><p>Cathro spoke of the need to ensure different groups in the community share information and work together on wildfire resiliency efforts. </p><p>Public support is the other challenge, Cathro said. \u201cFifty percent of all the FireSmart stuff we need to do needs to be education.\u201d  </p><p>Fuel modification, meaning the removal of certain types of trees, branches and woody debris, is necessary for village wildfire resiliency, and Cathro wants residents to know how to do this. </p><p>\u201cWe want to put fuel modification projects in as many neighbourhoods as possible so as many people as possible can see what it looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that you can go talk to your neighbours and do the same thing on your property.\u201d </p><p>Garret Fishlock, the RDCK FireSmart coordinator, spoke to the gathering about the importance of doing simple things like managing the first 10 metres around a home, saying that simple management of that area can greatly reduce property loss. </p><p>\u201cEverything within 10 metres is within our control,\u201d he said. </p><p>Illustrating this point, he showed videos of a wood house and deck surviving a forest fire less than 20 metres away. He said that the radiant heat from fire is essentially a non-factor in spread, but problems arise as burning embers blow onto a structure, collecting around the base. When this happens, any bushes, wood piles, excess cardboard \u2013 things that could be stored against a house \u2013 can light up. When you have flames in direct contact with a building, that building is likely to be engulfed in flames also.  </p><p>Residents of Kaslo are leading the way in FireSmart assessments, with 20% of residents having had them done compared with 9% in the rest of Area D and 5% across the entire regional district. </p><p>Kaslo\u2019s new Official Community Plan includes wildfire development permit areas to encourage further adoption of FireSmart principles. Village Chief Administrative Officer Ian Dunlop said this applies to properties within the \u2018wildland-urban interface\u2019 and includes everything from a new house to a major renovation. </p><p>The new legislation doesn\u2019t compel property owners to make specific changes, but is meant to be more of an educational piece forcing them to consider wildfires in their development plans. </p><p>\u201cThe current legislation uses language such as \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018may,\u2019\u201d Dunlop said, \u201cinstead of \u2018must\u2019 or \u2018shall.\u2019\u201d </p><p>The Village is also undertaking larger projects to protect the town and its infrastructure. Cathro described some hand treatments they have done on municipal lands such as the area around the airport. This work thins out the forest to make it less susceptible to large fires. </p><p>He said similar work they did last winter produced 80 to 90 truckloads of wood, most of which was turned into pulp.  </p><p>Kaslo &amp; District Community Forest Manager Jeff Reyden was on hand to discuss similar fuel reduction projects on community forest land, much of which surrounds the town. Large tracts of their tenure bore the brunt of the damage from the Briggs Creek fire and efforts are underway to salvage the sellable wood and protect undamaged areas from future fires.  </p><p>For homeowners, the first step to get property in shape is to schedule a FireSmart assessment. RDCK has a program to help residents out, offering free assessments and a rebate for work done toward meeting the recommendations. These assessments are finished for the winter but can be scheduled again for May.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c73d09fe726a45358149c898e11c9525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:670M-5DG1-DY9S-T53R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><timeReceived>02:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 1, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Spare News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Wildfire Service budget soared to S500 million and an estimated $80 million in tourism and other economic costs in the Central Okanagan alone. The urgency was reinforced by another severe fire season in</p><p>2009, where the bill reached $400 million.</p><p>\u201cMany of the 2003 and 2009 fires occurred in areas where fuels had accumulated over decades, and during dry, hot weather conditions, these fires became very large and intense,\u201d says the province\u2019s Wildland Fire Management Strategy, released in 2010 and still in effect today. \u201cFires like this remove so much forest cover that soil productivity can be reduced and soil erosion can lead to flooding, landslides, decreased water quality and a variety of other negative consequences.\u201d</p><p>Local politics is one impediment to changing an aggressive timber protection that started in the late 1940s as post-war heavy equipment and aircraft became available. Prescribed burns in spring produce heavy</p><p>smoke, and for decades logging restrictions focused on preserving \u201cview corridors\u201d along highways and around communities, accumulating fuel in the highest-risk locations.</p><p>In the latest revamp of forest policy, Premier John Horgan and Forests Minister Katrine Conroy have committed to more use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel load, citing Indigenous forest burn practices that cleaned out underbrush to make forests passable for migration and hunting.</p><p>Fuel cleanup around communities has proceeded slowly since the recommendations made after the 2003 fires. This past June, bracing for another hot summer of wildfires, the B.C. government added $20 million more to its community resiliency fund. The</p><p>program has assisted 116 B.C. communities with wildfire risk reduction work since 2018, when it was set up in response to back-toback record wildfire years in B.C.</p><p>The Union of B.C. Municipalities administers the community grant fund, along with the First Nations\u2019 Emergency Services Society of B.C. The next application intake begins June 30, for projects including residential fuel reduction, critical infrastructure protection, FireSmart training, emergency management, community planning and inter-agency cooperation.</p><p>Communities that can demonstrate high wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000 to cover up to 100 per cent of project costs, while lower-risk communities can apply for up to $50,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGAHRO-news20210924PPD359225</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGAHRO2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63P4-H1V1-JD2C-J325-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The new pegmatites were identified during the company's ongoing 2023 field exploration program that started in summer of 2023. The 2023 field exploration program is focusing on prospecting, sampling and geological mapping of existing and new pegmatite prospective areas that were identified using compilation and interpretation of geological maps, drilling, and recently acquired high resolution magnetic and LiDAR surveys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Johnathan More, Chairman of Power Metals commented, \"We are excited with the discovery of new pegmatites at Case Lake after we were able to mobilize a field exploration crew during a challenging forest fire season in northeastern Ontario. We are very happy with the progress of the field exploration program and look forward to further enhance the quality of targets we are generating for an upcoming drill program.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KEY EXPLORATION HIGHLIGHTS </p><p> The new pegmatite dikes occur about 1.5 km north of the Northeast dike in close proximity to Dome Nine. Field observations and assay results of samples collected in 2023 confirm presence of 10-to-15-meter wide spodumene bearing pegmatites with Lithium content as high as 1.12% Li&gt;2&gt;O (Figures 1 to 4).The 2023 field program confirmed presence of spodumene about 300 meters southeast of the Main Zone in the western part of the East dike (Figures 2 to 4).A new pegmatitic tonalite was identified approximately 1.3 km southwest of the West Joe Zone in metavolcanic units in an area where historical geological maps reported trenches with pegmatites and quartz veins that contain molybdenum (Figures 2 to 4).In addition to previously identified tonalitic domes that are prospective for Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum (LCT) pegmatites on the property, compilation of historical &amp; recently acquired LiDAR &amp; magnetic data identified nine pegmatite prospective new areas (Figure 5).These areas were identified based on presence of pegmatitic tonalites, lineaments , and their similar magnetic and LiDAR signatures compared to the signature of areas that host LCT mineralization at Case Lake.The company is progressing well with the 2023 field exploration program and is prioritizing the highlighted results to generate drill ready targets. Power Metals is fully budgeted for 15,000-meter drill program that is expected to start later in the fall.</p><p>Case Lake Property</p><p>The Case Lake Property is located 80 km east of Cochrane, northeastern Ontario close to the Ontario - Quebec border. The Property consists of 579 cell claims in Steele, Case, Scapa, Pliny, Abbotsford and Challies townships, Larder Lake Mining Division. The Property is 10 km by 9.5 km in size with 14 tonalite domes. The Case Lake pegmatite swarm consists of six spodumene dikes known as the North, Main, South, East and Northeast dikes on the Henry Dome, and the West Joe dike on a new tonalite dome, collectively forming mineralization trend that extends for about 10 km.</p><p>Power Metals have completed several exploration campaigns that have led to the discovery and expansion of new and historic spodumene bearing LCT pegmatites at Case Lake. The Company has drilled a total of 15,700 meters of core between 2017 and 2022 at The Property. The Case Lake Property is owned 100% by Power Metals Corp. A National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report has been prepared on Case Lake Property and filed on July 18, 2017.</p><p>Scientific and Technical Disclosure</p><p>The scientific and technical disclosure included in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Amanuel Bein, P.Geo., Vice President of Exploration for Power Metals, a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects.</p><p>Power Metals</p><p>Power Metals Corp. is a diversified Canadian mining company with a mandate to explore, develop and acquire high quality mining projects.

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.<br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Jan. 30, all 22 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> TICKETS<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.<br/><br/> According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.<br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.<br/><br/> PAST LOCATIONS<br/><br/> \\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8<br/><br/> \\x95 Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and

It focuses on fostering qualities that will help its young members succeed, introduced by Wendy Siemens, one of Topley 4-H \u201cA\u201d leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the banner of 4-H British Columbia, the club\u2019s activities cover a wide range, from farming to various non-farm projects, including travel opportunities like Food For Thought, Youth Action, and Provincial Club Week. The club\u2019s offerings cater to different age groups, from six to 21 years old. Older members act as mentors and guide the younger ones who look up to them.</p><p>The program\u2019s motto centers on \u201cLearning by Doing,\u201d Siemens introduced.</p><p>\u201cUntil the kids are 19, they can participate in market projects. In our club, we have beef, Cloverbuds, swine, sheep, outdoor living, horse, and small engines. Ages-16-through-20 members can become 4-H-Ambassadors. They will show up at events, help host events, speak at events, and help promote the programs.\u201d</p><p>The process of preparing a market steer by year-end involves a large amount of work, Siemens said. It begins in autumn with selecting and raising the steer while providing proper nourishment. Kids also acquire skills like halter training, grooming, washing, and leading the steer.</p><p>\u201cIt teaches them work ethic and responsibility, and they care about these projects. We\u2019re raising tomorrow\u2019s future farmers. That\u2019s important to us so that they get the knowledge and the skills to be successful as young adults and move forward with this. It\u2019s not just one small statement, but it\u2019s a big program.\u201d</p><p>The peak of their hard work comes to life on the third weekend of July, a culmination of achievement and celebration. Achievement day showcases the year\u2019s efforts, with projects proudly displayed. The highlight is the auction, a lively event uniting the community in support of the club.</p><p>The results of the members\u2019 dedication and hard work are unveiled during the auction, Siemens said. The auction features the sale of market animals, including hogs, sheep, steers, and even powersaws this year.</p><p>\u201cThis year looked a little bit different due to a major forest fire near our community, and the area was on high alert. We shrunk our achievement day down to be able to make everything happen.\u201d</p><p>The event spanned three days. \u201cOn Friday, the kids showcased their projects that they\u2019ve been working on throughout the year. On Saturday, they had an auction where they could sell market animals. The kids sold a couple of pies, power saws, hogs, sheep, and some steers this year. Our charity steer was the last thing to be sold.\u201d</p><p>The concluding item for auction was their charity steer. The funds generated from the auction were divided between the Houston Hospice Society and Houston Linked to Learning, which are two important causes in the community, Siemens said.</p><p>While the auction stands as an exceptional event within the 4-H program, it is not directly tied to the core program objectives.</p><p>\u201cThe club doesn\u2019t retain any money from the sale of the members. Hundreds of people came and it was a great time for the members to showcase their animals. Community members enjoyed our event and if they were able to buy something, they got good products at the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>With the support of an auctioneer from Prince George who donated his time, the atmosphere buzzes with excitement.</p><p>One of the challenges of running this volunteer-based club is for the volunteers to find time to get everything done. However, a committed group of people focuses on their strengths and collaboratively makes it work, Siemens said. When everyone contributes a little, a lot can be achieved collectively. Siemens emphasized that the club\u2019s success would not be possible without the support of families, who help raise funds, engage in community projects, and shape the very fabric of the club.</p><p>\u201cWe went on to a new venture, moving to new grounds, and we have made a lot of improvements at the old Museum Society in Houston at Four Seasons Park. Thanks to our families and our community supporters, who are fully behind us, we are able to achieve good things. Our community sees the positive impact these kids are making and the way they conduct themselves, and they are proud of that, so they want to support the kids. I don\u2019t believe that we would be as successful without strong families, great community support and our leaders.\u201d</p><p>Siemens added the children in the programs are very grateful for the community\u2019s support and contribute back in return. The community also enjoys supporting them because they recognize the effort invested. The mutual support keeps everyone active and engaged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a leader for 24 years now. It\u2019s exciting for me because I have some of my alumni who came back as leaders or have returned with their children now. Last year, our club grew exponentially. Currently, we have 62 members, the most in my 25 years. This is the largest our club has ever been.\u201d</p><p>Siemens envisioned a promising future of the club. \u201cThe club has already proved that it\u2019s a strong club and it\u2019s going to be around for a long time. I don\u2019t see any big changes in the future. We\u2019ve got a good thing going here and we want to keep it on the right track. We want to turn this into a regional event where we can invite some other clubs to participate on some level, because it is fun to gather and spend time with a lot of kids together. We\u2019ll see what we can do as we move forward. Overall, we\u2019re pretty happy with how things are going.\u201d</p><p>For more information about Topley 4-H Club, you can contact them via their Facebook page.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOUTOD-news20230830PQKA0003830940</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOUTOD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692F-YM81-JD2C-J0C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438225</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(Harfang or the Company) is pleased to announce that its summer field campaign is set to begin on its portfolio of highly prospective gold and lithium properties in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region, Qubec (Figure 1). With recent lithium discoveries, new advances in already existing resources and the Qubec strategy on Critical and Strategic Minerals (CSM), this region has taken centre stage for lithium exploration in Canada.</p><p>Commented Ian Campbell, President and CEO,We are ready and excited to initiate our $1.5 M summer 2023 exploration program that will focus on the exploration of our extensive portfolio of properties in James Bay, some of which have the potential to host both gold and lithium deposits. We are well positioned throughout the entire region in which our team has extensive operational experience. Our summer program will be a boots on the ground approach including both a geological and prospecting evaluation, combined with onsite geochemistry with the focussed objective of rapidly developing high-priority drill targets on both gold and lithium projects. This program will begin as soon as the province-wide restrictions imposed by the Qubec government as a result of the regional forest fire situation are lifted. We are not aware of any of our projects being directly affected by these fires at this time and we are closely monitoring the situation.</p><p>Gold Exploration Program</p><p>Lake Menarik Property</p><p>The Lake Menarik Property is characterized by multiple high-grade gold occurrences hosted in a polyphase intermediate intrusion (syenite, monzonite and monzodiorite) and adjacent volcano-sedimentary rocks (Figure 2). The geological setting of Lake Menarik is reminiscent of that of the Timmins mining camp based on the occurrence of gold-bearing monzonite/syenite intrusions, volcanic and sedimentary rocks including a Timiskaming-type conglomerate, and lamprophyres.</p><p>The recently completed maiden shallow drill program that mainly focussed on the Pierre Monzonite area, successfully demonstrated that wide zones of gold mineralization associated with increasing intensity of alteration extend at depth in the southeast area of the monzonite. These observations were highlighted by 21.0 metres grading 1.75 g/t Au including 14.1 metres grading 2.49 g/t Au (LMN-23-01), 75.0 metres grading 0.54 g/t Au including 3.0 metres grading 6.75 g/t Au and 1.0 metres grading 12.65 g/t Au (LMN-23-04), and 47.0 metres grading 1.15 g/t Au including 7.0 metres grading 3.75 g/t Au (LMN-23-17) (see news release dated May 11, 2023).</p><p>The planned field campaign is designed to generate additional drill targets and will focus on advancing the overall understanding of the geological model east of the Pierre monzonite and several other target areas. These areas include the Induced Polarization (IP) anomalies hosted in the Timiskaming-type conglomerate, the Greco gold showing adjacent to mining claims acquired last fall (1.04 g/t Au over 24.9 metres [channel]), and the 2022 discoveries such as the Oswald showing (up to 17.30 g/t Au, 217 g/t Ag and 0.61% Pb [grab samples] and up to 6.34 g/t Au, 60 g/t Ag and 0.09% Pb over 0.4 metres [channel]) and the ankerite zones (up to 2.87 g/t Au in grab samples) extending up to 700 metres long and 50 metres wide. This program will be enhanced by recent geophysical data from the IP survey and the detailed heliborne magnetic survey also flown over the contiguous Menarik East Property. Harfang has also designed a till survey to cover the eastern part of the Lake Menarik Property.</p><p>Lithium Exploration Program</p><p>Harfang will conduct a first-phase surface exploration program (prospecting, mapping, rock sampling) on its assets favourable for lithium occurrences. This program includes prospecting on the Serpent-Radisson and La Passe claims and on the new acquired Lemare, Ewart, Sakami, Ross and Conviac properties. These new assets were acquired by map designation following a recent geological compilation and a statistical processing of more than 13,400 analyses of lake bottom sediments extracted from the Qubec government digital database (SIGEOM) (see news releases dated on January 19 and February 8, 2023). The main objective of this program is to find Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum Pegmatite (LCT Pegmatite) warranting more advanced exploration, including drilling. More detailed information is given below for Serpent-Radisson, Lemare and Lake Menarik properties.</p><p>Serpent-Radisson Property</p><p>In 2022, Harfang conducted a preliminary prospecting program in the southeastern portion of the Property, already known for its gold and copper occurrences, to assess the potential for LCT Pegmatite. The program quickly led to the discovery of several pegmatite dykes, some containing highly anomalous beryllium (up to 25,000 ppm), cesium (up to 998 ppm), lithium (up to 1,420 ppm), niobium (up to 278 ppm), rubidium (up to 1,095 ppm) and tantalum (up to 173 ppm). The program for Serpent-Radisson will mainly focus on the follow-up on these discoveries since the Company believes this area contains significant potential based on the presence of a fertile S-type granite located in the immediate area. In addition, the field crew will continue prospecting the Property for gold, particularly in a large sector where 65 soil samples (up to 2.27 g/t Au) defined a gold anomaly covering 2.2 km2 (see news release dated October 5, 2022).</p><p>Lemare Property</p><p>The Lemare Property consists of 269 claims located approximately 20 kilometres southeast of the Whabouchi lithium deposit owned by Nemaska Lithium (Nemaska). Nemaska recently signed a long-term agreement with the Ford Motor Company for the supply of lithium products including lithium hydroxide, as North American automakers race to secure supplies of battery materials to meet the electric vehicle output. The Lemare Property includes several strong lake bottom sediment lithium anomalies of which four are 99.5th percentile of the entire SIGEOM database. Some of these calculated anomalies form a tight cluster in an area dominated by granite and pegmatite of the Opatica Subprovince.</p><p>Lake Menarik Property (Southwestern Part)</p><p>The southwestern portion of the Lake Menarik Property, west of the Billy-Diamond Highway, was staked last fall for its lithium and gold potential (Figure 3). Harfang is planning prospecting on these claims that have seen little historical exploration. Known mafic volcanic rocks on the Property offer a favourable geological setting for hosting lithium-bearing pegmatite. These volcanics are part of the same rock unit that hosts the Mia lithium occurrences located 25 kilometres to the southwest.</p><p>Actual Forest Fires Situation</p><p>On June 3, the ministre des Ressources naturelles et des Forts du Qubec issued a news release prohibiting access to the forest on lands of the public domain and on the closure of roads for consideration of public interest. The news release can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/incendies-de-foret-modif\">https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/incendies-de-foret-modif</url> ication-du-territoire-touche-par-linterdiction-dacces-en-foret-sur-les-terr es-du-domaine-de-letat-et-par-la-fermeture-de-chemins-48424.</p><p>The recent restrictions imposed by the Qubec government, as a result of the regional forest fire situation, have temporarily halted mining exploration operations in northern Qubec. Harfang is actively monitoring the situation and will be back on the field when the restrictions will be lifted.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release was prepared and approved by Franois Huot, P.Geo, Vice President Exploration of Harfang, who is a non-independent qualified person for the technical disclosure as defined by the National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI43-101).</p><p>About Harfang Exploration Inc.</p><p>Harfang Exploration Inc. is well financed with approximately $7.4 M in the treasury as of March 31, 2023 and is a technically driven mineral exploration company with the primary mission to discover ore deposits in Qubec and Ontario.

The buildings had been abandoned and derelict for 60 years, when the Friends of Wells Gray Park and BC Parks co-funded a restoration project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Stillwater Road turns right off the Clearwater Valley Road at km 35.7, just south of the Park entrance. The road descends to Blackwater Creek, then climbs up the other side of the valley. The trailhead to the Bee Farm is signed at km 3.5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A hike of less than 10 minutes leads to Smith Lake which is 400 m long at an elevation of 750 m. The trail skirts the lake on the right or south side, then goes over undulating terrain with a gradual descent to the next junction. Here, follow the left fork which soon reaches a collapsed bridge over Hemp Creek.</p><p>Continue upstream along Hemp Creek for about 30 minutes to reach the Bee Farm. The three main structures are the cabin, bee shed, and outhouse.</p><p>The Bee Farm is the story of two remarkable sisters, Jessie and Frances Emery. Jessie was born on Aug. 16, 1910 and Frances on May 23, 1913. Eventually, the family had nine children and they moved from Alberta to East Blackpool near Clearwater in 1922. The girls\u2019 father, Ernest, had invested in some bees and Jessie gradually took over his beekeeping tasks as she got older.</p><p>In the summer of 1926, life in Upper Clearwater took a dramatic change when a huge forest fire swept through the valley. Large burned tracts of land created by the fire were soon covered in fireweed, willow and other deciduous shrubs. Ernest died in 1928 and, by 1930, the Great Depression was taking hold on western Canada.</p><p>Jessie still managed to earn a small income from her six beehives on the Blackpool farm. The bee inspector told her about the vast fields of fireweed growing in the Hemp Creek Valley, thanks to the fire of 1926. In Upper North Thompson Reflections, Frances described how she and Jessie, assisted by older brother Norman and younger brother Ralph, relocated their beekeeping operation:Jessie filed for a homestead there in 1930 when we were 20 and 17, and we moved the bees to the Upper Clearwater Valley. Norman and Jessie built the cabin while Ralph and I split shakes and helped any way we could. There were beautiful cedar trees that had been killed by the fire but not really burned. What lumber we needed was split from them \u2026 Any other materials needed had to be packed to the Bee Farm, as the end of the road in 1930 was near Trout Creek.</p><p>The Canadian Association of Palynologists estimates that, to produce one pound of honey, bees must visit two million flowers, fly about 80,000 km and carry about 37,000 loads of nectar back to the hive. During peak flower blooming periods, bees from a single hive may visit up to 250,000 flowers in a single day. With such activity, a beekeeper\u2019s job continues year-round and, in the case of the Emery sisters, they had to hike quite a distance into the wilderness to tend their bees.</p><p>In spring, the hives\u2019 winter insulation was unwrapped, food supplies checked and dead colonies removed. If the queen was productive, the hive filled quickly with brood and honey and could run out of space, causing swarming. This was prevented by adding extra shelves (or supers), giving more space for honey production. In summer, honey was removed, processed and packed. During fall, the colony\u2019s health and strength had to be checked again because weak or diseased hives would be unlikely to survive the winter.</p><p>The sisters also had to protect their hives from invading animals because bee larvae and honey were a delicacy for bears, skunks and raccoons. In winter, the girls also had to check the hives regularly because the bees could suffocate if the entrance to the hives was blocked by a heavy snowfall. Charlie Ludtke recalled that his brother Fred had a trapline near the Bee Farm and he cleared away the snow from the hives when he went by.</p><p>After they had set up their beekeeping operation among the fields of fireweed, the Bee Girls realized they needed to expand, so they doubled their hives to 12 and began to enjoy even more plentiful honey harvests. They sold their honey for up to 18 cents per pound locally. With each of the 12 hives producing 200 to 250 pounds of honey, the girls could make as much as $540 per year.</p><p>Their business was flourishing.</p><p>The Shook family arrived in the Clearwater Valley in 1934 with nine children and homesteaded near Grouse Creek. Two of the boys were Floyd and Roy. Frances Emery recalled, \u201cOn March 1, 1934, Jessie and I headed for the Bee Farm to clean up the bee supers. On the way, we picked up the mail for the valley settlers and, while we were delivering it, we met Floyd and Roy Shook.\u201d</p><p>Soon the brothers arrived at the Bee Farm where they helped the girls finish some of the buildings and built a bee house for the hives. The romance developed from there. Frances married Floyd in 1936 and Jessie married Roy the following year. Two weeks after that wedding, Roy and Floyd\u2019s sister Freda married Frances and Jessie\u2019s brother Ralph, creating a triple relationship between two families of nine children.</p><p>Jessie and Frances kept the Bee Farm operating until about 1940. They did most of the work themselves because Roy and Floyd were busy on the homesteads and not too interested in bees after all. Both had young children and trips to the Bee Farm entailed packing children along too. In addition, the forest was gradually growing again after the fire and replacing the once-abundant fireweed with other plants. The hives were brought out from the Bee Farm about 1945. Jessie kept a few hives at home until she was in her sixties.</p><p>Roy Shook owned several small sawmills and the family moved frequently between mill sites. Jessie was kept busy with their five children, her wonderful gardens, and her beehives.</p><p>They retired in Barnhartvale, a suburb of Kamloops. Jessie died in 1991 and Roy in 1999. Frances and Floyd raised four children and moved to Vavenby in 1947, then to Barriere, Louis Creek and back to Vavenby in 1960. Frances returned to the Bee Farm only once, with her brother-in-law Charlie, when she was 80. Charlie wrote about this event:Fifty-four years after leaving the Bee Farm, Frances Shook came back\u2026 Frances\u2019 greatest fear was that her old home would be dilapidated, but she was pleasantly surprised at what she saw. The lilac bush still grows strongly and blooms well, a big reward for backpacking in its first beginnings and giving it loving care 60 years ago.</p><p>Floyd died in 1981 and Frances in 2001, just before her 88th birthday.</p><p>Seventy years after the Emery sisters established their Bee Farm, an examination of the buildings revealed their deteriorating condition. Comprehensive restoration was completed in 2001, co-funded by B.C. Parks and the Friends of Wells Gray Park.

The buildings had been abandoned and derelict for 60 years, when the Friends of Wells Gray Park and BC Parks co-funded a restoration project.</p><p>The Stillwater Road turns right off the Clearwater Valley Road at km 35.7, just south of the park entrance. The road descends to Blackwater Creek, then climbs up the other side of the valley. The trail head to the Bee Farm is signed at km 3.5.</p><p>A hike of less than 10 minutes leads to Smith Lake which is 400 m long at an elevation of 750 m. The trail skirts the lake on the right or south side, then goes over undulating terrain with a gradual descent to the next junction. Here, follow the left fork which soon reaches a collapsed bridge over Hemp Creek.</p><p>Continue upstream along Hemp Creek for about 30 minutes to reach the Bee Farm. The three main structures are the cabin, bee shed and outhouse.</p><p>The Bee Farm is the story of two remarkable sisters, Jessie and Frances Emery. Jessie was born on Aug. 16, 1910 and Frances on May 23, 1913. Eventually, the family had nine children and they moved from Alberta to East Blackpool near Clearwater in 1922. The girls\u2019 father, Ernest, had invested in some bees and Jessie gradually took over his beekeeping tasks as she got older.</p><p>In the summer of 1926, life in Upper Clearwater took a dramatic change when a huge forest fire swept through the valley.</p><p>Large burned tracts of land created by the fire were soon covered in fireweed, willow and other deciduous shrubs. Ernest died in 1928 and, by 1930, the Great Depression was taking hold on western Canada.</p><p>Jessie still managed to earn a small income from her six beehives on the Blackpool farm. The bee inspector told her about the vast fields of fireweed growing in the Hemp Creek Valley, thanks to the fire of 1926. In Upper North Thompson Reflections, Frances described how she and Jessie, assisted by older brother Norman and younger brother Ralph, relocated their beekeeping operation:Jessie filed for a homestead there in 1930 when we were 20 and 17, and we moved the bees to the Upper Clearwater Valley.</p><p>Norman and Jessie built the cabin while Ralph and I split shakes and helped any way we could. There were beautiful cedar trees that had been killed by the fire but not really burned. What lumber we needed was split from them.</p><p>Any other materials needed had to be packed to the Bee Farm, as the end of the road in 1930 was near Trout Creek.</p><p>The Canadian Association of Palynologists estimates that, to produce one pound of honey, bees must visit two million flowers, fly about 80,000 km and carry about 37,000 loads of nectar back to the hive. During peak flower blooming periods, bees from a single hive may visit up to 250,000 flowers in a single day. With such activity, a beekeeper\u2019s job continues year-round and, in the case of the Emery sisters, they had to hike quite a distance into the wilderness to tend their bees.</p><p>In spring, the hives\u2019 winter insulation was unwrapped, food supplies checked and dead colonies removed. If the queen was productive, the hive filled quickly with brood and honey and could run out of space, causing swarming. This was prevented by adding extra shelves (or supers), giving more space for honey production. In summer, honey was removed, processed and packed. During fall, the colony\u2019s health and strength had to be checked again because weak or diseased hives would be unlikely to survive the winter.</p><p>The sisters also had to protect their hives from invading animals because bee larvae and honey were a delicacy for bears, skunks and raccoons. In winter, the girls also had to check the hives regularly because the bees could suffocate if the entrance to the hives was blocked by a heavy snowfall. Charlie Ludtke recalled that his brother Fred had a trapline near the Bee Farm and he cleared away the snow from the hives when he went by.</p><p>After they had set up their beekeeping operation among the fields of fireweed, the Bee Girls realized they needed to expand, so they doubled their hives to 12 and began to enjoy even more plentiful honey harvests. They sold their honey for up to 18 cents per pound locally. With each of the 12 hives producing 200 to 250 pounds of honey, the girls could make as much as $540 per year.</p><p>Their business was flourishing.</p><p>The Shook family arrived in the Clearwater Valley in 1934 with nine children and homesteaded near Grouse Creek. Two of the boys were Floyd and Roy. Frances Emery recalled, \u201cOn March 1.1934, Jessie and I headed for the Bee Farm to clean up the bee supers. On the way, we picked up the mail for the valley settlers and, while we were delivering it, we met Floyd and Roy Shook.\u201d</p><p>Soon the brothers arrived at the Bee Farm where they helped the girls finish some of the buildings and built a bee house for the hives. The romance developed from there. Frances married Floyd in 1936 and Jessie married Roy the following year. Two weeks after that wedding, Roy and Floyd\u2019s sister Freda married Frances and Jessie\u2019s brother Ralph, creating a triple relationship between two families of nine children.</p><p>Jessie and Frances kept the Bee Farm operating until about 1940. They did most of the work themselves because Roy and Floyd were busy on the homesteads and not too interested in bees after all. Both had young children and trips to the Bee Farm entailed packing children along too. In addition, the forest was gradually growing again after the fire and replacing the once-abundant fireweed with other plants. The hives were brought out from the Bee Farm about 1945. Jessie kept a few hives at home until she was in her sixties.</p><p>Roy Shook owned several small sawmills and the family moved frequently between mill sites. Jessie was kept busy with their five children, her wonderful gardens, and her beehives. They retired in Barnhartvale, a suburb of Kamloops. Jessie died in 1991 and Roy in 1999. Frances and Floyd raised four children and moved to Vavenby in 1947, then to Barriere, Louis Creek and back to Vavenby in 1960. Frances returned to the Bee Farm only once, with her brother-in-law Charlie, when she was 80. Charlie wrote about this event:Fifty-four years after leaving the Bee Farm, Frances Shook came back... Frances\u2019 greatest fear was that her old home would be dilapidated, but she was pleasantly surprised at what she saw. The lilac bush still grows strongly and blooms well, a big reward for backpacking in its first beginnings and giving it loving care 60 years ago.</p><p>Floyd died in 1981 and Frances in 2001, just before her 88th birthday.</p><p>Seventy years after the Emery sisters established their Bee Farm, an examination of the buildings revealed their deteriorating condition. Comprehensive restoration was completed in 2001, co-funded by B.C. Parks and the Friends of Wells Gray Park. The project was partly finished when the Friends organized an interpretive hike to the Bee Farm in July 2001. Joining the group were all four of Frances\u2019 children (the first time they had been there as adults) and two of Jessie\u2019s children, a remarkable family reunion.</p><p>A journalist, Nigel Pooley, visited the Bee Girls in 1938 and wrote a story about them which was published in the Family Herald &amp; Weekly Star on January 18, 1939. It gives some slightly different facts about the amazing story of Jessie and Frances Shook, but is reproduced here in its entirety.</p><p>-Above is an excerpt from Exploring Wells Gray Park, written by Roland Neave.
