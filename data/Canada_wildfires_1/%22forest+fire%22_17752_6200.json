Further to the north, another 12,000 hectares are burning in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Numerous other fires are being held or brought under control while still others, in less populated areas, are being monitored - part of a trend in the province that already has seen 537 fires this year, compared to the 10-year annual average (360).</p><p>\"On a day like today, where there's a lot of sun, those fires not under control are expected to grow,\" says Shayne McCool, a spokesperson with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. A change of wind direction, from north to south on Tuesday, meant the smoke was likely visible to the residents of North Bay, he says.</p><p>About 20 residences in Temagami have been evacuated because of a 100-hectare fire and the town, which is about 90 kilometres northwest of North Bay, is on a voluntary evacuation notice.</p><p>Fire rangers set up sprinkler systems to protect structures in the Temagami marina.</p><p>Police say there is a \"dangerously close, active forest fire\" in the area, according to The Canadian Press, and residents have been asked to drive north on Hwy. 11 to escape the flames.</p><p>The northeast has seen an increased number of forest fires this year. As of Tuesday morning, there were 69 active fires across that part of the province and 27 were not yet under control. Another nine were being held and the remainder were either under control or being observed. More fires were confirmed Tuesday morning after Monday's thunderstorms and the ministry said in a news release it expected to find several more.</p><p>The \"risk (of fire) is huge, because of the lack of precipitation that we've seen and the high amount of heat,\" McCool says.</p><p>About 400 firefighters from Ontario are working in the area. A relief crew of 85 firefighters from Alberta and British Columbia arrived Tuesday.</p><p>On Monday and Tuesday, water bombers were used to suppress the fires so crews could go in on the ground and surround areas with fire hoses, soaking the perimeter so the flames would move inwards. Planes called Fire Boss amphibians were also used; they can scoop up water from lakes and rivers, and were on loan from Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has restricted open fires in a large area from French River north to Timmins and from Sault Ste. Marie to the Quebec border. The ministry is allowing gas-powered stoves for cooking and heat, but McCool says they should be used with extreme caution.</p><p>If anyone is caught breaking the ban they could be subject to fines of up to $25,000 and three months in jail. The ministry investigates fires to determine the cause and McCool says they can litigate to recover firefighting costs.</p><p>The Muskoka and Kawartha areas are also at an extreme risk of forest fire, according to a ministry rating, and there are a number of much smaller fires burning in those areas, some set off by lightning but others caused by people. Two crews are working on a 12-hectare fire near Parry Sound.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are thousands of hectares of forest on fire in the northwest part of the province.</p><p>About 3,500 hectares are burning 19 kilometres away from the First Nations community of Nibinamik, which is also called Summer Beaver, but the fire is moving away from the community, says Chris Marchand, a spokesperson for the natural resources ministry's northwest region.</p><p>Another fire, 10 kilometres from Summer Beaver, is also moving away from the community. They were ignited by lightning strikes Sunday and Monday.</p><p>There are also tens of thousands of hectares on fire near the Manitoba border, where some fires have been burning for a month. Crews are monitoring the situation, but the area is mostly unpopulated and some of the fires will be allowed to burn out.</p><p>By comparison, Manitoba has had 316 fires so far this year, 38 of them still active. That's up from 2017 numbers when 50 fires were reported in the first six months of the year.</p><p>Saskatchewan has had 355 fires, 28 of them still burning over the same time period.</p><p>Alberta's fire control is divided with much of the north and a swath of the western portion of the province deemed forest protection area. Smaller areas of the province are managed by municipal fire protection.

He is likely just months away<br/>from replacing Jean Chretien as Prime Minister, and Martin is certainly looking<br/>like a politician preparing for the country's top political post. Today he was in<br/>British Columbia saying it was the first official item on his agenda after winning<br/>the Liberal leadership last weekend. Surveying the damage caused by forest<br/>fires near Kamloops and Kelowna, Martin pledged to push Ottawa to get federal<br/>assistance flowing to the province as soon as possible. CTV's Todd Battis has<br/>more.</p><p>TODD BATTIS [Reporter]: A lesson in firefighting from BC's Premier. Gordon<br/>Campbell's hospitality extends beyond tour guide. The province is paying for<br/>Paul Martin's trip, an unusual gesture to someone not even in the federal<br/>cabinet. The scorched landscape of the interior is a long way from his riding of<br/>Lasalle, Quebec. Martin wanted to survey the extent of the damage from the<br/>air, and the range of his popularity on the ground.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: That's good luck for your job as Prime Minister.</p><p>BATTIS: Hundreds of people could have used that earlier this summer when<br/>fires destroyed their homes. While focused on the damage, Martin did address<br/>Sheila Copps' determination to remain in the Liberal leadership race.</p><p>PAUL MARTIN [Prime Minister in Waiting]: As far as I'm concerned, she's<br/>entitled to pursue whatever course she wants.</p><p>BATTIS: The leadership convention comes next, but make no mistake, this<br/>was an election style campaign stop complete with media mob and sound bites.</p><p>MARTIN: In the decade ahead, the Canadian spirit is going to manifest itself<br/>as we grab at the opportunities, grasp at the opportunity.</p><p>BATTIS: Promising return visits, Martin tackled a subject few federal Liberals<br/>dare mention.</p><p>MARTIN: The distance between British Columbia and Ottawa is not measured<br/>only in kilometres, but it's measured in attitudes, and we're going to change<br/>those attitudes.</p><p>BATTIS: While there's much work to be done, it appears he's making some<br/>gains.</p><p>PETER RATZLAFF [Kelowna Resident]: I'm for him to a degree, about 80<br/>percent.</p><p>BATTIS: After spending what is being described as a quiet night in Vancouver,<br/>Paul Martin will try to win over yet another group Thursday morning when he<br/>addresses representatives from the province's municipalities.

(CP) - Hundreds of residents in this Okanagan Valley resort town were ordered to leave their homes Monday as an out-of-control forest fire licked at the suburbs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The order came after a rapidly spreading inferno jumped a containment barrier in rugged hills overlooking the city of 27,000 at the south end of Okanagan Lake, about 250 kilometres east of Vancouver.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some houses in the forested areas along the hills were reported to have burned late Monday afternoon as the fire ballooned to 1,000 hectares from 500 on Sunday.</p><p>The leading edges were a few hundred metres from one part of the city's outer limit and less than five kilometres from the downtown core by late afternoon.</p><p>\"This is a real threat,'' said Forests Ministry spokesman Maurice Davidson. \"This is about as serious as it gets.''</p><p>As the fire roared through tinder-dry sagebrush, grassland and lodgepole pine at the edge of the city, officials ordered residents away from one rural and four city subdivisions. The total number of people ordered out was estimated at 500.</p><p>Three other subdivisions were on alert.</p><p>\"There's no stopping it,'' said Janet Scott, who lives in the cluster of 50 homes first ordered evacuated. \"There is no water supply up there and no fire hydrants.''</p><p>Two huge water bombers were scooping water from Skaha Lake at the south end of the city and drenching the fire.</p><p>Albert Perozuk, reached in a restaurant on the city's main street, said the fire could be seen creeping over the hills.</p><p>\"You can drive out to our viewpoint and see just how huge it really is.''</p><p>City streets were clogged with cars Monday afternoon as anxious residents raced home to pack up precious belongings and others headed to the Penticton Community Centre for temporary shelter.</p><p>\"We're telling people to take only a few personal possessions and leave as quickly as possible,'' said Roger Venables, spokesman for the Penticton Forest District.</p><p>Power officials said the fire threatened the city's power supply.</p><p>Two main transmissions lines were knocked out and two older and smaller lines were drawn into service.</p><p>\"This is critical. People have to get off the electrical system,'' said Mike Bradshaw, spokesman for West Kootenay Power.</p><p>Smoke billowed up the valley. In Kelowna, 60 kilometres to the north, residents said ash was falling from the sky and forming a thin film on parked cars.</p><p>The hot, dry conditions heightened the forest fire flashpoint in British Columbia, especially in the southern Interior where temperatures hit the high 30s and humidity was in the 25 per cent range.</p><p>Thunderstorms, which because of lightning strikes produce more new fires rather than dampening existing ones, swept through the area overnight along with gusting winds.</p><p>Sylvia Pang, spokeswoman for the B.C. Forest Service, said there were 168 fires burning throughout the province on Monday, up from 129 Sunday and including 147 new fires in the last four dys.</p><p>So far, 1,051 fires have charred more than 4,200 hectares and cost $12 million to fight.

Fire personnel were not concerned about any danger to the public.</p><p>The fire has remained about the same size since it was first discovered Tuesday afternoon. The fire was spotted by Wainfleet volunteer firefightters and at about 5 p.m. the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority was informed.</p><p>Bruce Timms, chairman of the NPCA, said staffwere fast acting once they heard about the fire. A helicopter was used for the first time to scout the area to locate the fire. Timms said in the past firefighters had struggled to locate fires through smoke on the ground, so it made sense to use a helicopter this time.</p><p>The helicopter also helps in determining how large the fire is.</p><p>\"In 2012 we watched it burn like many other bog fires in the past for a number of weeks. But given the dryness of the ground, the weather and how early in the season it is, we thought it best to attack this aggressively and get it controlled as soon as possible,\" he said.</p><p>Kevin Kerkhof, fire management technician, aviation, forest fire and emergency services with the MNR, said the fire is limited in spreading due to waterways surrounding it on three sides.</p><p>\"With the conditions we have and the wind conditions we have and the ability to get on it quickly, we should be able to get this thing under wraps fairly quickly,\" he said.</p><p>There are two, four person-fire ranger crews, as well as a safety officer and Kerkhof working on extinguishing the fire. By surveilling the area via helicopter, fire crews were able to locate bodies of water that can be used to fight the fire. Firefighters are using ATVs to access the fire.</p><p>Carmen D'Angelo, chief administrative officer and secretary treasurer of NPCA, said last week the NPCA and the Township of Wainfleet recommended restricting access to the bog due to dry conditions.</p><p>\"Anything can start a fire, whether it's human error with a cigarette butt, an ATV, so there are a lot of causes, but the primary cause of bog fires are lightning strikes, but we haven't had a lot of rain lately,\" D'Angelo said.</p><p>NPCA contacted Niagara Public Health about the fire on Wednesday morning. Members from the NPH visited the site to give an assessment. Dr. Mustafa Hirji, associate</p><p>medical officer with NPH, said as of Wednesday afternoon there didn't seem to be much smoke and health risks were low.</p><p>He said this could change at any time, so people should stay aware. If people smell smoke they should go indoors, close the windows and use air-conditioning if possible.</p><p>Hirji said people should also avoid exercising near the bog.</p><p>The cause of the fire is unknown and will be investigated by the MNR and fire chief Harry Flagg.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MAllenberg@postmedia.com\">MAllenberg@postmedia.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

However, incidents of looting have still occurred. Amidst thousands of people evacuated as a result of wildfires throughout the Interior and Cariboo in 2017, for example, arrests were made in connection to looting in 100 Mile House and Williams Lake.</p><p>\"To me, that's just beyond the pale,\" Gillis said. \"If you inflict that kind of misery on people who have already got more than enough to cope with, it seems to me that more severe punishment should be in order.\"</p><p>Bill C-447 proposes to apply an aggravating factor to trigger stiffer penalties during sentencing if the crime was committed in the presence of a forest fire, flood, earthquake, tornado or other disaster, or when a local or provincial government or federal official declares an evacuation order.</p><p>While judges can take any factor raised in a case into consideration during sentencing, the proposed update would essentially mean it is automatically considered.</p><p>\"What we're doing is saying that society, through Parliament, views these crimes as being harsher than others, so the penalty should be, as well,\" Albas said.</p><p>He tabled the private member's bill in May after hearing demand for federal support in communities impacted by emergencies. Other places, such as Australia and some states in the United States, already consider emergencies in sentencing, he said.</p><p>Albas said the bill is intended to protect property owners and encourage evacuation. In addition, he said, looting complicates emergency response efforts and draws away resources.</p><p>\"I looked into it, researched it and found that the Criminal Code is completely silent on this fact,\" he said.</p><p>Albas said he has received strong support from across the country since he tabled the bill, including from West Kelowna, Logan Lake, the Central Okanagan Regional District, Alberta's attorney general and the mayor of Ottawa.</p><p>Albas hopes his idea can carry on to becoming law should he fail to secure re-election this fall.</p><p>\"Part of the reasowwn why I'm running in this election is to see things like this, so that we don't lose the momentum here,\" he said. \"There's obviously a really strong feeling right across the country.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-3845095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPX-5BT1-JDH1-C0P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Barriere Star Journal (N.

Fire personnel were not concerned about any danger to the public.</p><p>The fire has remained about the same size since it was first discovered Tuesday afternoon. The fire was spotted by Wainfleet volunteer firefightters and at about 5 p.m. the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority was informed.</p><p>Bruce Timms, chairman of the NPCA, said staffwere fast acting once they heard about the fire. A helicopter was used for the first time to scout the area to locate the fire. Timms said in the past firefighters had struggled to locate fires through smoke on the ground, so it made sense to use a helicopter this time.</p><p>The helicopter also helps in determining how large the fire is.</p><p>\"In 2012 we watched it burn like many other bog fires in the past for a number of weeks. But given the dryness of the ground, the weather and how early in the season it is, we thought it best to attack this aggressively and get it controlled as soon as possible,\" he said.</p><p>Kevin Kerkhof, fire management technician, aviation, forest fire and emergency services with the MNR, said the fire is limited in spreading due to waterways surrounding it on three sides.</p><p>\"With the conditions we have and the wind conditions we have and the ability to get on it quickly, we should be able to get this thing under wraps fairly quickly,\" he said.</p><p>There are two, four person-fire ranger crews, as well as a safety officer and Kerkhof working on extinguishing the fire. By surveilling the area via helicopter, fire crews were able to locate bodies of water that can be used to fight the fire. Firefighters are using ATVs to access the fire.</p><p>Carmen D'Angelo, chief administrative officer and secretary treasurer of NPCA, said last week the NPCA and the Township of Wainfleet recommended restricting access to the bog due to dry conditions.</p><p>\"Anything can start a fire, whether it's human error with a cigarette butt, an ATV, so there are a lot of causes, but the primary cause of bog fires are lightening strikes, but we haven't had a lot of rain lately,\" D'Angelo said.</p><p>NPCA contacted Niagara Public Health about the fire on Wednesday morning. Members from the NPH visited the site to give an assessment. Dr. Mustafa Hirji, associate medical officer with NPH, said as of Wednesday afternoon there didn't seem to be much smoke and health risks were low.</p><p>He said this could change at any time, so people should stay aware. If people smell smoke they should go indoors, close the windows and use air-conditioning if possible.</p><p>Hirji said people should also avoid exercising near the bog.</p><p>The cause of the fire is unknown and will be investigated by the MNR and fire Chief Harry Flagg. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MAllenberg@postmedia.com\">MAllenberg@postmedia.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Fires also sent plumes of smoke billowing up from southern Colorado and in Rocky Mountain National Park to the north.</p><p>At the Black Forest Fire, six helicopters and an air tanker were on the scene, Maketa said. The office of Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., said C-130 cargo planes were expected to be prepared to help fight the fire Wednesday.</p><p>The area is not far from last summer's devastating Waldo Canyon Fire that destroyed 346 homes and killed two.</p><p>\"It's very, very reminiscent of what we experienced in Waldo Canyon,\" Maketa said.</p><p>However there were no immediate reports of injuries in the fires.</p><p>All of the fires moved quickly Tuesday, driven by record temperatures and strong winds. The conditions were making it difficult to build containment lines around the fire, and sparks jumped across them.</p><p>\"Weather is not working with us right now, but our guys are giving it a heck of a shot,\" Maketa said.</p><p>In southern Colorado, the Bureau of Land Management said three structures have been lost in a fire on about 6 square miles near the Royal Gorge Bridge. Authorities evacuated Royal Gorge Bridge &amp; Park, home of the soaring suspension bridge spanning the canyon across the Arkansas River.</p><p>A third wildfire in southern Colorado erupted Tuesday in rural Huerfano County. The Klikus Fire had burned an estimated 45 to 50 acres west of La Veta, prompting evacuation orders for about 200 residences.</p><p>The causes of those fires weren't immediately confirmed.</p><p>A fourth wildfire sparked by lightning Monday in Rocky Mountain National Park quickly grew to an estimated 300 to 400 acres Tuesday. No structures were threatened.</p><p>In the Colorado Springs area, George Gonzales, 74, and his wife stayed in their motorhome in the parking lot of a Red Cross shelter set up for evacuees from the Black Forest Fire. He said the two were eating lunch in town when his daughter got an alert on her phone about the fire and called them.</p><p>An officer let them go back home to retrieve their dogs, their motorhome and truck, and his heart medicine, George Gonzales said.</p><p>\"Sure, we're worried, but we're hoping for the best,\" he said.</p><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has authorized federal funds to defray costs of fighting the Black Forest and Royal Gorge fires.</p><p>\"There is nobody backing away and saying we're not going to attack this with everything that we've got,\" Gov. John Hickenlooper said late Tuesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-3942d03c7ea24b99969fe0426e9ef45a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58MS-WTN1-JBVR-31R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>05:43 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 12, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The ministry apologies for any inconvenience caused by the extended closure.\"</p><p>Tofino mayor Josie Osborne expressed frustration with Wednesday morning's closure and told the Westerly News that residents and visitors need accurate information around when the highway will be closed so that they can plan trips in or out of town.</p><p>\"I think it's frustrating for everyone to see our one and only highway closed unexpectedly. After safety, my biggest concern is accurate, timely communication so people know what to expect in terms of possible delays and changes to their travel plans, and the District of Tofino has relayed this concern directly to the Ministry,\" she said.</p><p>She added that residents should always be prepared for road closures and that information must be relayed to travellers.</p><p>\"Whether it's due to construction or a natural event like a landslide or forest fire, the risk of highway closure is something we all need to take into account when it comes to emergency preparedness and trip planning,\" she wrote. \"Events like these are all part of living on the West Coast, but that doesn't always make it easy to explain to visitors. Patience goes a long way and again, accurate information goes a long way too so plans can be adjusted when necessary.\"</p><p>This story will be updated as soon as new information comes in.</p><p>READ MORE: Highway closures hit travellers heading in and out of Tofino and Ucluelet</p><p>READ MORE: Construction on Hwy. 4 halted after tree crashes into traffic</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrew.bailey@westerlynews.caLike\">andrew.bailey@westerlynews.caLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-3843840</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPP-5YB1-F103-3490-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vancouver Island Free Daily</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Energy &amp; Utilities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Blasting Controls</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0FEMERGM0JGRjM4NEM2QUI1RUE0RTFBOEMxNzFFNDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUU1QkEwN0ZENkRDNDAxNjkxOTUyMjNEQTVCRTVFOEI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000506</classCode><className>DISASTER PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001914</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

That issue is 'danger trees'.</p><p>A 'danger tree' is defined as a tree that can cause potential damage to life or property when it falls.</p><p>In my opinion there are at least two places of special concern in our area: along Highway 5 between Blackpool and Little Fort, and the danger trees in and around our public school playgrounds, (Raft River Elementary is a good example).</p><p>I must admit the words, 'danger tree' doesn't generate the same news coverage as a forest fire but that could change very quickly if one fell on a bus full of school kids or tourists.</p><p>Bob Mumford</p><p>Birch Island, B.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BARSTR-3466435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BARSTR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PW6-HNX1-F105-624M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"240\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Barriere Star Journal (N.

Executive director Rob Marshall said phase one of the project is currently underway, having previously received support from the Rural Dividend Fund.</p><p>@SalmonArm <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jim.elliot@saobserver.netLike\">jim.elliot@saobserver.netLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECC-3874678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4M-J111-JDH1-C2JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Country Calendar (Winfield)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4QD</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

They also insisted the world should wean itself quickly from coal, oil and gas that cause climate change.</p><p>\"Stop the criminal contaminant behaviour of big corporations,\" said Argentine climate activist Bruno Rodriguez. \"Enough is enough. We don't want fossil fuels anymore.\"</p><p>Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN secretary general's youth envoy, called climate change \"the defining issue of our time. Millions of young people all over the world are already being affected by it.\"</p><p>During Thunberg's short lifetime, for example, the Earth has already warmed 0.34 degrees C.</p><p>Fiji climate activist Komal Karishma Kumar said global warming is not just taking a toll on the planet but on her generation, especially people from vulnerable places like her Pacific island nation.</p><p>\"Young people from different parts of the world are living in constant fear and climate anxiety, fearing the future, the uncertainty of a healthy life or a life for their children at all,\" Kumar said.</p><p>She added: \"I do not want our future generations to submerge with our sinking islands.\"</p><p>After listening to Thunberg and other youth climate activists, a tie-less Secretary General Antonio Guterres credited young people with transforming him from a pessimist to an optimist in the fight against global warming.</p><p>Guterres said he sees \"a change in momentum\" going into Monday's Climate Action Summit taking place ahead of the UN General Assembly gathering of world leaders that starts Tuesday, telling the youths \"you have started this movement.\"</p><p>\"I encourage you to keep your initiative. Keep your mobilization and more and more to hold my generation accountable,\" Guterres said. \"My generation has largely failed until now to preserve both justice in the world and to preserve the planet.\"</p><p>Kumar told Guterres that \"we will hold you accountable and if you do not, remember we will mobilize to vote you out.\"</p><p>The youth activists brainstormed about what they could do to change the trajectory of an ever-warming planet and how they can help the world adapt to climate's changes. There was talk of hashtags, entrepreneurial ideas and climate art and poetry.</p><p>\"Be that hummingbird that puts out the forest fire by fetching water with its small beak as all the other animals, including the elephant, told her it was impossible,\" said Kenyan activist Wanjuhi Njroge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019092255728973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-0KS1-DY91-K0NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DTNM</classCode><className>ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSTY</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DSGI</classCode><className>FOSSIL FUELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001240</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DM6V</classCode><className>ANTONIO GUTERRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DO5O</classCode><className>GRETA THUNBERG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A26S</classCode><className>EARTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC337</classCode><className>ARGENTINA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) _ Raging forest fires in the southeast corner of Manitoba could worsen in the days ahead due to extreme conditions, conservation officials warned Sunday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Community members and fire crews fought a blaze near Vassar over the weekend with water bombers and water tank trucks, in a desperate effort to stop the fire from chewing through their backyards and toward their homes.</p><p>Some residents of the town lost sheds and fences to the blaze, about 135 kilometres southeast of Winnipeg in the Rural Municipality of Piney.</p><p>But conservation officials warned Sunday that existing forest and brush fires will spread further and new fires could begin in the days ahead.</p><p>The fire hazard could be particularly serious in areas of the province where humidity is lower than the temperature, creating especially dry conditions.</p><p>''The (fire) conditions in the eastern region have gone from high to extreme,'' said Tom Mirus, Manitoba Conservation's fire program manager.</p><p>He said no communities or homes were currently threatened, but members of the public were being asked to stop using all-terrain vehicles until there's rain.</p><p>Mirus said the forecast was calling for some precipitation on Monday.</p><p>''That sure would help,'' he said. ''That would really give us a break if that happens.''</p><p>However, the long-term forecast of sunny skies and warm weather isn't promising, he said.</p><p>In Vassar, Frances Boutang, 94, said her Main Street home of 25 years was spared but all of the trees and bush 100 metres away on the other side of the railroad tracks from her were levelled by fire.</p><p>''I went to get the hose going outside instead of leaving,'' Boutang said Saturday night. ''I found the hose wasn't connected and then I found the water wasn't on. ''</p><p>''My children wanted me to leave, but I wanted to stay because there was no point in leaving until the fire got to this side of the tracks ... fortunately it didn't.''</p><p>Another Vassar resident, Bonnie Zimmerman, said water bombers kept flying by, drenching the blaze for hours Saturday afternoon.</p><p>''Everyone was out working hard with shovels,'' she said.</p><p>''We're just watching and waiting now. There are still a few fires going on in the woods -- we can see smoke.''</p><p>Volunteer firefighters in the Rural Municipality of Springfield were also kept busy on Saturday. More than 40 firefighters east of Winnipeg fought five grass fires near wooded areas, as temperatures hovered around 25 C, high above the normal high of 15 C for this time of year.</p><p>''We're just sore and tired,'' Deputy Chief Garth Cook said late in the afternoon, after crews finished battling their fifth fire.</p><p>''There was no property damaged and no injuries. We have two stations and both stations were out just going from fire to fire.''</p><p>(Winnipeg Free Press, Winnipeg Sun)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20070429CPCPG8518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4NM5-5JR0-TX4V-K2RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>April 29, 2007 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000DO78</classCode><className>ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They started a week to 10 days ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a resource burn, done under a burn plan,\" she explained. These types of fires, called Category 4, are designed to burn slash piles as well as any detritus between piles left on the ground as a result of logging activities.</p><p>\"From our standpoint, we want this stuff gone,\" she explained, so it doesn't provide fuel for fires during the summer fire season.</p><p>Because of a temperature inversion and uncharacteristically low relative humidity for the area-Effingham Inlet weather station on the west coast was reporting 20-30 per cent relative humidity, which is unheard of in a rainforest at this time of year, MacPherson said-conditions became dry, and the smoke stayed around the area instead of moving off. The dry conditions caused these burns to spread beyond the area listed in their burn plans.</p><p>The Mount Irwin fire was supposed to be within two hectares, and the three Gretchen Creek fires were to be between 1.5-2 ha. each. \"Those four have nominal growth beyond the burn plan,\" MacPherson said.</p><p>\"The burn left the square in the burn plan. It's a low intensity ground fire\" that is creeping along underneath the trees, \"probably about knee high.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, a helicopter was in the air to monitor the sites while six ground-based firefighters and a water tender were at two of the sites. One of the Gretchen Creek sites is in a steep area and is only being monitored at this time, she said.</p><p>The helicopter was not dumping water on any of the fires.</p><p>All four of the sites north of Port Alberni are owned and managed by the same logging company, but MacPherson was not able to name the company, citing privacy regulations. She did say that the cost to manage the burn areas is being paid for by the logging company.</p><p>\"We sent officers out to make sure they are complying,\" she said.</p><p>There is also a planned slash burn near the Comox Valley that is visible closer to Cumberland, MacPherson said.</p><p>There is a bigger fire in southern Vancouver Island, near Sooke, that has also slipped out of its prescribed burn area and grown to 40 hectares. MacPherson said the burn plan for that particular fire was 30 hectares, and it is visible from Sooke.</p><p>\"It was the same concerns that people had. It's still not threatening anything because it's such a low-intensity fire,\" she said.</p><p>Because of changes to terminology in the way wildfires are labeled in B.C., these fires are showing on the BC Wildfire website that they are \"out of control\". To a member of the public, that means something very different than to a wildfire management team member, MacPherson explained.</p><p>\"It's either 'out of control', 'being held' or 'modified response,'\" she said. \"It's a technical term.\"</p><p>British Columbia has made the terminology changes to conform with a new Canada-wide standard, which will make it easier when fire crews from other provinces are sent to fight inter-provincial fires.</p><p>\"It's hard for our public to wrap their heads around it. Ontario has been using (the term) for about five years and they're fine with it.\"</p><p>The good news is the temperature inversion is over, and Arctic outflow winds are picking up, so the smoke should clear. Wet weather expected at the end of this week will also assist with the burning.</p><p>The Sooke area fire will continue to burn until the cold, wet weather extinguishes it naturally, but it will stay active on the BC Wildfire website until forestry crews monitoring it are satisfied that it's completely out, she added.</p><p>The same will hold true for the Gretchen Creek and Mount Irwin fires-they will be listed as active until they're out, but they're no threat. \"It's not a forest fire like people think of a forest fire,\" she added.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@albernivalleynews.com\">editor@albernivalleynews.com</email></p><p>blackpress.tv</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AVLNWS-3465853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AVLNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PW0-GP01-JDH3-G1VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alberni Valley News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 1, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's for emergency purposes, mostly, in the case of a forest fire or an earthquake, or whatever else could happen,\" Peters said. \"It's also for economic development for the town and access to Block 200. It could also be a bypass for heavy trucks, logging trucks, because it's very precarious for the logging trucks to go through what they call traffic calming [which is prevalent along the main street of Lake Cowichan]. It would be a lot easier for everybody if the logging trucks didn't have to go by there.</p><p>\"They [the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure] are going to do a study for us, they're willing to put some funds forward, to look at doing it in phases.</p><p>READ MORE: CRD board puts the brakes on alternative Malahat route</p><p>READ MORE: Overpass, barrier, more parking considered for Cathedral Grove</p><p>READ MORE: TimberWest won't log above Youbou this year in wake of landslide risk report</p><p>The proposed route would be from Highway 18 somewhere east of the current town entrance, across the river into Hudgrove Road, along Block 200 and then across TimberWest land to come out west of town on South Shore Road near the entrance to Lakeview Park, he said.</p><p>Talks with the provinvial government began after Peters wrote back in March to MOTI Minister Claire Trevena on behalf of the town, other local politicians, economic development people, business and community interests, and Lake Cowichan's Ts'uubaa'asatx First Nation.</p><p>MOTI representative Michael Pearson, in an email to Peters July 4, said the ministry would be ready to get started on \"a high level cost estimate that can inform further planning and budgetary work for the design and construction of the entire bypass alignment. This can also be broken down into components (i.e. the bridge crossing and perhaps sections of the bypass.\"</p><p>\"The ministrty is not committing to funding or undertaking the construction of a bypass route. As discussed, I suspect that a significant portion, if not all of this bypass would be constructed through a subdivision development process. This work, however, will inform everyone of the order of magnitude of costs needed to achieve this.\"</p><p>And that excites the mayor.</p><p>\"I think it's pretty exciting for us after I don't know how many years of trying to get a bypass that we've finally got somebody doing something on it. It won't happen in my time but as long as we can get inside the door there, it's good.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-3837121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKX-JGH1-F103-32CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vancouver Island Free Daily</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001003</classCode><className>LANDSLIDES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002184</classCode><className>ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N484200CC</classCode><className>SPECIAL FREIGHT TRUCKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001914</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002184</classCode><className>ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001794</classCode><className>VEHICLE TRAFFIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) - Strong winds hindered the battle Monday against two large forest fires burning in the foothills of central Alberta.</p><p>The largest fire, about 120 kilometres west of Rocky Mountain House, had more than tripled in size by Monday and had destroyed 160 hectares of forest, said Mag Steiestol, a spokesman for the Alberta Forestry Department.</p><p>The second blaze, which was also classified as out of control, had burned 303 hectares of forest in the Lost Guide Creek area.</p><p>Steiestol said strong winds were fanning the flames of both fires, which 193 firefighters were battling.</p><p>Firefighters were also hampered in their battle against the largest of the two fires, near the Big Horn River, because of steep terrain.</p><p>\"We're having a lot of problems with local winds and the terrain is very rugged,'' said Steiestol.</p><p>Forestry officials believe the fire was likely the result of an abandoned campfire.</p><p>Winds and warm fall temperatures have created an unusually high fire hazard for this late in the year.</p><p>\"We were all smiles and, of course, we were looking at the lightning season kind of being over, but now we're into the dry season,'' said Steiestol.</p><p>Hunters, campers and outfitters have been asked to leave the area around the two fires.</p><p>The largest fire in the area was set deliberately a week ago by forestry personnel to remove dead underbrush and improve wildlife habitat.</p><p>\"It was lit under the right conditions but then we had some unexpected winds that gave us some problems,'' said Steiestol.</p><p>So far this year, 797 fires in Alberta have burned 29,000 hectares of forest. At the same time last year, 809 fires had destroyed 24,000 hectares of forest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199409260249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1994</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470S-HB50-01G6-84R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"278\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1994 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>September 26, 1994 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOUSE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>\u00a0ALBERTA FORESTRY DEPARTMENT\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DS9K</classCode><className>HABITAT CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We dispute \"facts\" and their implications, and I find the most difficult thing to understand is how someone as unlike Trump in style can support him in substance.</p><p>Dave does not stalk around behind me, interrupting my every utterance, with \"You have nothing to say,\" as Trump did to Hillary Clinton.

Many bunked with relatives, while others stayed at a high school or with strangers who opened their doors.</p><p>Firefighters worked frantically to control the 5,000-hectare fire about 12 kilometres from town.</p><p>The fire was holding steady by late Monday afternoon, said Joel Cooper of the Natural Resources Ministry.</p><p>There were 75 forest fires burning in Northern Ontario on Monday, 64 of them out of control. Most were in the northwest.</p><p>More than 120 residents were evacuated from two other Northern Ontario communities in the last few days.</p><p>About 100 people fled an area bordering Longlac as fire destroyed an unknown number of homes, cottages and commercial buildings Sunday, said Bob Thomas, another ministry spokesman.</p><p>Officials were worried about the tiny railside community of Oba where about 20 people were evacuated.</p><p>Fires were also inching toward Kapuskasing, Pickle Lake and the First Nations community of Osnaburgh.</p><p>Northeastern Ontario was declared a restricted fire zone Monday. All campfires are banned and burning permits cancelled.</p><p>Officials have called it the worst fire season to hit Ontario in more than a decade.</p><p>Very little snow last winter left trees and the soil that moistens their roots very dry. An unusually hot August has added to the problem.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dubreuilville residents worried about the long-term repercussions of the fire. Half the town works for Dubreuil Forest Products Ltd. and if it goes up, so do the jobs.</p><p>\"The town is highly dependent on the lumber mill, jobs are scarce,'' said Nantel. \"If that's gone, where do you go and what do you do.''</p><p>Wawa embraced the refugees Monday with shelter and food.</p><p>\"I've never seen such an outpouring from people in the 25 years that I've lived here,'' said Wawa Coun. Jim Aquino.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199508210242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:470T-WW10-01G6-80HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>August 21, 1995 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>DUBREUIL FOREST PRODUCTS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N624230MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N321113MM</classCode><className>SAW MILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N321000CC</classCode><className>WOOD PRODUCTS MFG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

So take your pick.</p><p>The Russia probe. The Bannon thing. The travel ban. Spicer, Scaramouche and Sessions and that's just the Ss. NFL kneeling, Nunes memo, North Korea, just the Ns. Carter Page, the kid-glove handling of white supremacists in Charlottesville. S***hole countries. Tillerson's \"moron.\"</p><p>Dave Gallo, at his table with a Trump insignia golf towel draped over a chair, concedes it's been an eventful stretch since we last spoke a year ago, for a story I undertook with some reluctance on how anyone can be a Trump supporter. I offered him asylum under a witness protection program. No, I didn't have to. Back then he was proud of it.</p><p>A reader emailed asking if I'd consider a kind of one-year checkup with Dave, given all that's happened. Mmmmm, I said, but my editors were keen. There might've been an expectation that the year had worn down Dave's enthusiasm.</p><p>\"Trump has been making my hair go grey,\" he jokes. His hair's not grey. Mine is. But I did remember he'd just had a pacemaker put in when Trump took office. And I wonder about his heart; he's fine.</p><p>After the column appeared, Dave did take some heat (so did I, for writing it, despite declaring my opposite bias), but that's to be expected. I mean, it's Trump.</p><p>\"It wasn't abusive,\" Dave says of the feedback.</p><p>About the worst was someone who wanted him to give a high school athletic trophy back.</p><p>So to end your suspense - no, Dave predictably hasn't changed his spots, any more than, predictably, I have mine. Dave says Trump got a lot done. Really? I say. He doesn't like everything, but he produces from a folder a list of achievements from the first year. It itemizes 57, including cancelling the TPP trade deal; lifted restriction on coal and gas production; sanctions against North Korea; infrastructure commitments; tax reform.</p><p>Mainly, for Dave, it's the economy. The stock market boomed.</p><p>\"All indicators are up. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years. Incomes are going up. But it's all about sustainability. Is this just a blip? Still you have to give him some of the credit.\"</p><p>All these \"achievements\" (Dave also likes his foreign policy and toughness with North Korea) depend on whose information and whose interpretations you draw on; I'll grant the economy hasn't tanked, yet.</p><p>But I want to go through the litany, the forest fire, I mentioned at the top.</p><p>So I start, in no particular order (Order? You expect order?),\" with the Ban-on brothers. First we saw a ban on travel and then we saw a Bannon (Steve) travel, and keep on travelling, right out of the oval bunker and all the way into the left-out, delisted Coventry of psycho-con disfavour.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Okanagan officials are expected to welcome a provincial government funding commitment of $111 million over the next three years to support wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finance Minister Carole James revealed that spending priority in her 2019-20 budget presentation Tuesday in the Victoria.</p><p>Bruce Smith, spokesman for the Regional District of Central Okanagan, said fuel modification efforts have been carried out by valley civic governments and the regional district over the past decade.</p><p>\"Most of that has been based on government grants combined with local government commitments as well,\" Smith said.</p><p>He noted fuel modification work has been done in regional parks and rural neighbourhoods that interface with forested areas.</p><p>\"We've done fire suppression projects in Rose Valley, Kalamoir Park, Mission Creek Park and even our new park in Black Mountain that hasn't even officially opened yet,\" Smith said.</p><p>\"We know it helps reduce the impact of any fire that might occur, especially for us in our regional parks.\"</p><p>This funding will be in combination with the $60 million announced last year under the Community Resiliency Investment to also reduce wildfire risk.</p><p>Sonja Zoeller, communication manager for the ministry of finance, indicated the new fire suppression money will be targeted at direct fire control, communication and community engagement during wildfire season.</p><p>How much of that $111 million will end up in the Okanagan region is yet to be determined, Zoeller says, as those decisions will unfold over the next few months.</p><p>READ MORE: Lake Country to pursue wildfire mitigation grant</p><p>READ MORE: Brush fire in West Kelowna is fuel mitigation work</p><p>READ MORE: Collaborating with First Nations on wildfire mitigation</p><p>READ MORE: More planned forest fires needed</p><p>As well, a further $13 million has been budgeted to address forest restoration in areas damaged by disease and wildfires.</p><p>Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development Minister Doug Donaldson said last year fire suppression funding is a reflection of the current forest fire realities facing the province, of the need to spend more money on preventative measures because of the rising cost to combat forest fires.</p><p>The provincial government has allotted $64 million each of the last two budget years to fight forest fires, and the actual costs in both years was more than 10 times what was allocated.</p><p>\"The aggressive nature and the large nature is something that's been predicted and is now here, so what we have to do is bolster our preventative and mitigative measures,\" said Donaldson.</p><p><email

We also had five structural fires which is more than ever before. These were detached homes or buildings and we managed those fires really well. Nothing alarming stands out in terms of calls for service.\"</p><p>He adds that there are four main areas that the detachment focuses on; response, training, prevention and administrative services.</p><p>READ MORE: Much work being done on fire protection for Kimberley</p><p>\"The department continues to evolve into a modern day operation and utilizing the latest advances in technique and technology,\" said Prasad. \"Coupling this with the professional approach taken by all fire department personnel has resulted in another successful year.</p><p>\"Wildfire threat was on the mind of every member of our community as, for the first time in years, our community considered evacuation. Additionally, we responded to 195 other emergencies including structure fires, BCAS assists, motor vehicle incidents, hazardous material incidents and various other events.\"</p><p>He adds that officers conducted 316 inspections in 2018.</p><p>\"Our commercial property inspection program serves as a valuable way of engaging our business community,\" said Prasad. \"The current staffing model has allowed us to complete a substantially higher number of inspections and thus has had an immeasurable effect on the safety of this community.\"</p><p>In terms of fuels management, Prasad says their program saw some substantial work being done.</p><p>\"Like no other year, our fuels management practices demonstrated their relevance and going forward we will continue to aggressively reduce the threat of wildfire to our community,\" Prasad explained.</p><p>Councillor Darryl Oakley asked about the potential of a fireguard for the community.

The Muskoka fire season runs from April 1 to October 31 each year. The rating is verified daily and updated whenever the rating changes.</p><p>The Muskoka Fire Danger Rating is determined using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an internationally used method for determining the risk of fires in open air. It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the forest fire danger rating is made in consultation with the fire chiefs of the six area municipalities and the ministry of natural resources. What do the ratings mean?</p><p>Low Low danger of fire. You may conduct any municipally permitted fire activities. No daytime burning. Campfires for cooking and warmth only.</p><p>Moderate Moderate danger of fire. Carry out permitted fire activities with caution. No daytime burning. Campfire for cooking and warmth only. Carry out any burning with caution.</p><p>High High danger of fire. Only absolutely necessary municipally permitted activities should be carried out. However, it is recommended that no burning should occur. No daytime burning. Avoid campfires, even for cooking and warmth if possible. Fire danger is serious - use extreme caution.</p><p>Extreme Extremely high fire danger. Total fire ban. No burning allowed at any time of the day. No fires, including charcoal barbecues.</p><p>Fire Ban In some cases, should the fire danger rating be at high or extreme, the municipality should choose to issue a fire ban. When the fire ban is in place, no burning of any kind is permitted. Fireworks are not permitted. Fire ban in effect.</p><p>For daily updates and a verbal explanation of the current rating, please call the pre-recorded information line at: 1-877-847-1577.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2018052446015197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDP-GK61-F105-616G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The Amazonian Rainforest produces 20% of the world's oxygen and is also home to approximately three million species of plants and animals and one million indigenous people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EcoForests CEO Michael Ackerman has called on government officials to \"learn from privately owned plantations where risk levels for fires are minimal.\" With consistent pruning, cleaning, and organic fertilization to eliminate weeds that typically start forest fires, the risk is substantially lowered for fires to start and spread on a widespread basis.</p><p>Applying Lessons from the Private Sector to National Forests</p><p>A Hancock Timber Resource group study found that with $300 Billion invested in managed forests across the globe, less than .05% is affected by forest fire or flood. According to Ackerman, \"Forestry investment plantations receive considerable checks-and-balances that care-taking and management of plantations is optimal. There is a need for additional resources and political willingness to improve the management of state-owned forestlands. With the technology and safety measures available today, the Amazon forest crisis should not be happening.\"</p><p>An example of positive resource allocation and political willingness to protect its forestland is Honduras, which has recently made great strides to protect federal plantations. In 2013, Honduras became the first country in Latin America to initiate negotiations for a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan to create systems that improve forest management and incentivize responsible operations. Similarly, Costa Rica, which lost about two-thirds of its Rainforest from 1950-1987 due to deforestation and government inaction, has doubled its forest cover in the last 30 years, after introducing stricter federal management policies.</p><p>Upcoming EcoForests Projects</p><p>As part of its Impact Investing mandate and commitment to sustainable forestry practices, EcoForests is excited to introduce several upcoming agricultural-forestry (\"agroforestry\") projects in South America, with a focus on Ecuador and Colombia, two nations with strong forestry protection laws. These projects will each centre around the harvesting of cacao beans and continue EcoForests' sustainable operating principles into the agroforestry sector.</p><p>About EcoForests</p><p>EcoForests is a boutique forestry investment management company that manages high-end tropical timber species on behalf of their global private and institutional investors, maximizing returns through a commitment to quality, technique, sustainability and security. Headquartered in Toronto, EcoForests has forestry operations in Central and South America with regional offices in Hong Kong, USA, Israel and UK.</p><p>ECOFORESTS OPINION: Michael Ackerman, CEO of EcoForests Asset Management (\"EcoForests\") released statement supporting global outcry on inaction of current Brazilian government to prevent Amazonian forest fires, provides insight into lessons to be learned from private sector to avoid future fires.</p><p>For media inquiries, please contact:<br/>Rachel Naiman <br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:R.Naiman@ecoforests.ca\">R.Naiman@ecoforests.ca</email></p><p>For investor inquiries, please contact:<br/>Matthew Edwards<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:M.Edwards@ecoforests.ca\">M.Edwards@ecoforests.ca</email></p><p>SOURCE: Ecoforests Asset Management</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/557780/Amazon-Fires-Continue-Destruction-of-Lungs-of-the-Earth-Rainforest\">https://www.accesswire.com/557780/Amazon-Fires-Continue-Destruction-of-Lungs-of-the-Earth-Rainforest</url><br/><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/486/1458/18/156702301221.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/486/1458/18/156702301221.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-152596047</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXJ-W1R1-F11P-X0JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ACCESS Newswire Inc.

Highway roadblocks were brought down this morning.</p><p>Firefighters gained control of the forest fire Monday. Most of the residents, who were evacuated to Lynn Lake and Thompson, were expected to be back in their homes by tonight.</p><p>Hot, dry autumn weather fed the fire.</p><p>Water bombers were used to douse flames and firefighters used bulldozers to move earth and rip through stands of spruce to build firebreaks aimed at keeping the blaze a few kilometres from town, which was evacuated Sunday.</p><p>It's believed the fire was one of a dozen that were started last week by lightning strikes.</p><p>Most of the evacuees drove 100 kilometres north to Lynn Lake where many bunked with friends and relatives or were put up in hotels or other facilities.</p><p>About 170 were flown south to Thompson where they slept in two high school gymnasiums. Some simply climbed into their campers and drove to their lakeside holiday haunts.</p><p>The situation is a reversal from last year when 850 residents of Lynn Lake spent a week in Leaf Rapids and Thompson to escape a huge fire.</p><p>Many fires break out in the region every summer and evacuations are becoming almost commonplace for local residents.</p><p>\"It's the third time in five years we've had to leave,'' said Andre Thibault, who was evacuated to Lynn Lake. \"It's starting to become a fact of life.''</p><p>In Leaf Rapids, emergency workers were also kept busy feeding cats, dogs and other pets left behind in the rush to evacuate.</p><p>\"We're getting phone calls from people letting us know that they do have animals and what their needs are,'' said town administrator Ernie Epp.</p><p>Officials said the fire was fuelled by a summer-long drought during which the northern part of Manitoba received half its usual amount of rain.</p><p>The evacuation was a harrowing one for Sheldon Lambe, who escaped with his pregnant wife Margie - already few days overdue - and his 2 1/2-year-old daughter Jessica.</p><p>\"It looked like thunderclouds,'' Lambe said of the thick smoke enveloping the town.</p><p>The employee of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co.

James Johnston of the Lethbridge detatchment.</p><p>Samantha Grant, a spokeswoman for STARS air ambulance, said an 80-year-old woman was flown from the Fort Macleod hospital to Calgary with second-and-third-degree burns.</p><p>All 350 residents of Granum and another 250 people from the surrounding area were sent to neighboring Claresholm as a grass fire burned close to the town, about 130 kilometres south of Calgary.</p><p>However, most were allowed to return home later in the evening after the danger had passed.</p><p>Claresholm Mayor Ernie Patterson said not all residents of the region were as lucky: \"There are some families who have lost their homes. It's just been a calamity.''</p><p>Stan Byers and his wife Clara saw their place outside the village burn to the ground.</p><p>\"I just don't know what we are going to do. Other people get to go home now, but where do we go? Nowhere,'' said a shocked Stan Byers. \"I just stood there looking for that ray of hope the fire would pass by the house.''</p><p>Patterson said firefighting efforts and a lucky shift in the wind stopped the blaze right on the edge of Granum.</p><p>\"We've had no snow,'' Patterson said of local conditions. \"The forest fire hazard is extremely high.''</p><p>The blaze, which fire officials said had burned 100 square kilometres of land, also forced the closure of Highway 2 and prompted women and children to flee the Keho Hutterite colony.</p><p>It was a sad scene at the Claresholm high school, where about 60 evacuees awaited the chance to return to Granum. Many hugged and cried as they consoled each other.</p><p>\"I'm holding out hope, that's all I can do,'' said long-time Granum resident Ray Raine, who took his dog Bernie with him as he fled his home.</p><p>Eileen Cooper of Barons, a town just east of Granum, said the fire was an eerie sight.</p><p>\"While the sun was out we could see what seemed like a mixture of billowing sand and smoke. At one time the sun was rust-red,'' she said.</p><p>One of the fires at Hinton, 300 kilometres west of Edmonton, was believed to have started Saturday night when an electrical pole toppled over and was fuelled by winds of up to 80 kilometres an hour.</p><p>Rocky Notnes saw his two-storey log home burn to the ground, along with a garage and several cars.</p><p>\"We just woke up because the house was filling with smoke,'' he said. \"We went outside and saw the fire. The wind was so strong we knew it could come this way, and then as we were speaking, there was just fire literally dropping from the sky.</p><p>\"We headed straight down to the river in the moonlight. It's a miracle that no one was killed.'' Firefighter Perry Hayward said the winds were unbelievably strong.</p><p>\"It was really jumping all over the place. It was bad enough that some residents of Hinton were told to be ready to evacuate at any time if the wind shifted.''</p><p>Most veteran firefighters said they had never worked on a forest fire this late in the year.</p><p>\"I was supposed to be decorating the Christmas tree and then going ice-fishing,'' said Dave Lind of Lac La Biche. \"But it looks like I won't be back for maybe a week or so. We need the winds to calm down before we get this one under control.''</p><p>Evert Smith of Alberta's Land and Forest Service said one of the two fires covered 500 hectares north of the community. The second blaze, about 1,500 hectares in size, blazed about 30 kilometres south of the town.</p><p>Six water tankers, four helicopters and eight ground crews were fighting the fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199712150020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4706-DYT0-01G6-839J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>December 15, 1997 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DQD2</classCode><className>AIR MEDICAL TRANSPORT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DQD2</classCode><className>AIR MEDICAL TRANSPORT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>N621910CC</classCode><className>AMBULANCE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX429</classCode><className>CALGARY, AB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They cleaned up most of the site and packed out the garbage.</p><p>The couple are worried about the possibility of other fires being set in the area by campers and getting out of control.

The main route out of the city is the Trans-Canada Highway.</p><p>Mayes said reception centres would be set up in nearby communities where any Salmon Arm evacuees could seek emergency shelter.</p><p>If the alert is followed by an evacuation order for the city, the exodus would be unprecedented in local memory, said Mayes.</p><p>Four hundred to 600 people in the fire's path were forced to flee last Wednesday when 90 km/hr winds whipped up the flames and sent them toward the city.</p><p>The blaze raced across one valley in minutes, with a heat so intense that mature trees turned to blackened matchsticks in seconds. Some 40 buildings, including 16 homes in outlying areas, were destroyed.</p><p>But Mayes tried to quell any alarm.</p><p>\"The fire's not going to be on us with like just minutes; we're going to have time,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're forecasting these winds. We know when they're going to pick up. If the order comes in, we'll simply start on the areas closest to the fire, then we'll move out from there.\"</p><p>The local hospital was evacuated last week when the fire first threatened the city. Yesterday, squads of volunteers were making arrangements for residents of senior citizens' lodges and anyone else who might have difficulty making their way to safety on their own.</p><p>\"One of the key things is how long will these gusts last,\" said Anne Ferdinands, an information officer with the B.C. Forest Service.</p><p>The blaze is capricious, said fire boss Roy Benson, describing the situation as \"the most extreme fire behaviour that any of us have ever seen.\"</p><p>A force of more than 300 firefighters, with more than a dozen helicopters and two giant Martin Mars water bombers attacking the fire from above, worked feverishly yesterday to extend fire guards around the perimeter of the blaze.</p><p>'FRESH LEGS'</p><p>They will be joined today by 100 soldiers from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Regiment, who underwent a day of training yesterday before heading to the fire line.</p><p>\"We're here as fresh legs,\" said Maj. Dave Anderson. \"The forest service has been at it for seven to 10 days now. The crews are getting tired and we're here to assist them.\"</p><p>The soldiers will be mainly assigned to mop up and contain the fire within its perimeter, said Anderson.</p><p>\"It's unlikely that we'll be used after one day's training at the frontal end of the fire. We'll be used at the flanks to stop it from spreading.\"</p><p>The blaze now covers an area equal to almost 5,000 football fields. Every morning, Salmon Arm is covered in a pall of smoke that extends west toward Kamloops. The haze usually lifts by early afternoon, allowing helicopters and water bombers to see their targets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Dave Olecko - The Calgary Herald; A helicopter takes off from Shuswap Lake after it picked up a load of water to attack the approaching fires in the hills around Salmon Arm, B.C.
