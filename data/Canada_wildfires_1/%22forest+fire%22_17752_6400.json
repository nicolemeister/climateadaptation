Grandbois and three friends started the local chapter after reading about climate strikes across Europe.</p><p>He pointed to alarming statistics that shows why pressure must be kept on governments and organizations.</p><p>\"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has given us until 2030 to reverse our cores and to limit our warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrious levels,\" said Grandbois. \"That gives us 10-and-a-half years which is a blink of an eye in terms of climate.\"</p><p>Calling the climate situation \"urgent,\" Grandbois said world governments and corporations are \"seemingly not doing anything to address the problem but, in fact, are going in the opposite direction.\"</p><p>Which is where he and his fellow protesters come in.</p><p>\"It's been going well,\" said Grandbois of the strikes. \"We've been pretty much exceeding membership targets for each rally. We see a core dedicated group of youth time and time again who really are dedicated to this fight. And it's very important that they are.</p><p>\"This is the struggle that will determine the future of our generation.\"</p><p>Grandbois cited some alarming climate news, such as in Greenland where, over the course of two days, the country lost 23.5 billion tonnes of ice, \"absolutely unprecedented,\" he said, \"and it shows a very bleak future.\" Or a forest fire in Russia that burned 4.2 million hectares of forest, larger than Switzerland.</p><p>And, for local impact, he said one doesn't have to look farther than B.C.'s wildfire season.</p><p>\"It's estimated for every degree the world temperature rises on average, a forest will burn about 600 per cent faster,\" said Grandbois. \"We already have a fire season here in B.C. that goes out of control most years. To have forests burning that much faster is going to be absolutely devastating for B.C, Canada and the world.\"</p><p>Grandbois is planning more individual strikes and protests with Earth Strike. On Friday, Sept. 27, the chapter will be part of an international general strike where it's estimated millions of workers worldwide will lay down their tools and go on strike for their climate.</p><p>\"Vernon chapter workers and students will be fighting together on that day for a collective cause, which is the future of our species,\" said Grandbois.</p><p>Final details for the local event are still being worked out.</p><p>@VernonNews <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:roger@vernonmorningstar.comLike\">roger@vernonmorningstar.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERNON-3849820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERNON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT1-W5P1-JDH1-C4JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vernon Morning Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 11, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>PE000DO5O</classCode><className>GRETA THUNBERG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC534</classCode><className>GREENLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>GC327</classCode><className>SWITZERLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's very difficult because of strong winds and heavy smoke,\" Yiorgos Psathas, head of the local Dirfys-Messapia municipality, told state TV ERT.\"A firefighter was injured after trying to cross the fire on a motorbike, and three cars belonging to campers were burned,\" he said. The fire on Greece's second largest island after Crete, located northeast of Athens, started near a protected wildlife habitat at about 3:00 am (0000 GMT) and was quickly spread by strong winds.Smoke from the fire billowed as far as the capital some 90 kilometres (55 miles) away.Over 200 firefighters were fighting the blaze backed by 75 fire trucks, five water-bombing helicopters and six planes on an 11-kilometre front.The crews faced rugged terrain, violent wind gusts, hills and poor visibility, complicating air operations.- 'You can't see the sun' -\"The flames are 20-30 metres (65-100 feet) high... You can't even see the sun,\" Panos Agiannitis, a volunteer firefighter at the scene, told Athens municipal radio.\"I feared for my life... You could feel the heat 250 metres away.\"\"The only way for this fire to be extinguished is when there's nothing left to burn,\" he said.The local Panagia Makrymallis monastery was evacuated first as a precaution, TV SKAI said. </p><p>The winds blew the smoke from the blazing pine forest north toward the central Magnesia region and south to the Attica peninsula and Athens.State agency ANA said the pine forests on Evia are part of the \"Natura 2000\" European network of protected areas and habitats.Greece has been hit by a spate of wildfires since the weekend, beset by gale-force winds and temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).The PM acknowledged that the country's fire crews had had a grueling five-day stretch, with the fire department noting that 56 fires had broken out over the past 24 hours alone.\"I am aware that our firefighters, particularly over the last five days, have given their all, they are without sleep and often without food,\" Mitsotakis said.Other fires on Tuesday were contained on the island of Thassos, the central region of Viotia, and in the Peloponnese region.On the island of Chios, a fire started by a group of more than 40 migrants seeking to be rescued after crossing the Aegean from Turkey -- with one of them drowning in the effort -- was also battled.On Monday, a major forest fire threatening homes in Peania, an eastern suburb of Athens, was brought under control. At least two houses were burned but there were no reports of injuries.On Sunday, a fire on the small island of Elafonissos, in the Peloponnese, was brought under control after a two-day battle.Two more fires were doused on Saturday in Marathon, close to Mati, the coastal resort where 102 people died last year in Greece's worst fire disaster. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031565716048641251762900071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT8-KMW1-JCMN-Y037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><timeReceived>5:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 13, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001TJO</classCode><className>BOMBARDIER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC3721 AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>BBD.A (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Baden firefighters were also called out to help.</p><p>The fire could have started and spread easily because brush was very dry due to a recent lack of rain, said Andrew McMillan, fire prevention officer for the Wilmot Township fire department.</p><p>There was no burn permit for a controlled fire on this property, he said, so firefighters investigated and made sure the brush fire couldn't spread.</p><p>Pfennings Organic Farm owns the small bush and surrounding fields, said Wolfgang Pfenning at the scene Tuesday afternoon. But no one had set any fires and the New Hamburg farm's staff were working elsewhere that day, he said. Pfenning spotted the smoke and arrived to find the fire department already there. How the fire started was a mystery, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2016061438475183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K1H-6621-JDV5-F2WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

His opinion rants are always full of irrelevant and deliberately misleading data and he tries hard to smear smart, honest, helpful people to kick up useless distracting controversy. This time Fletcher tried hard to smear the Red Cross, and Nobel Peace Prize winner (for his studies and work on climate change) Dr. Andrew Weaver.</p><p>Fletcher probably idolized J. Jonah Jameson (from Spiderman) as a kid and has spent most of his adult career trying to emulate him</p><p>Reading Fletcher's opening sentence (about last winter being the coldest on record) is enough to prove he's full of garbage and no more relevant than a tabloid gossip columnist.</p><p>Dealing with the backlash to this opinion piece, Fletcher tries to defend himself on Facebook by referencing his Campbell River Mirror article about the Okanagan floods and high stream volumes and early run-off in the Cariboo (in early May) due to early snow melt. Ridiculously this is his \"scientific proof\" that climate change isn't responsible for the fires. What a joke.</p><p>The reality is that eight of the last 10 years have been the hottest globally in scientifically recorded history. It's also been more than 20 years since the Cariboo had a typical cold winter (one week of 40 below, or several weeks of 20 below), necessary to kill off enough bark beetles to prevent epidemics.</p><p>The areas that are burning now (part of a devastated Vancouver Island sized, pine forest) are so full of dead mountain pine beetle wood that it's usually hard to find a green conifer in them more than 50 years old.</p><p>Whether Fletcher felt chilly in Victoria or Vancouver last winter is as irrelevant as the rest of his useless column.</p><p>Graham Gerry</p><p>James Bay</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SANNWS-3400157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2K-J261-F105-63K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438250</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Saanich News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 19, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000150</classCode><className>AWARDS &amp; PRIZES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DPPQ</classCode><className>GOSSIP &amp; RUMORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009RCL</classCode><className>NOBEL PRIZES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(\"Providence\" or the \"Company\") announces that the Company's efforts continue to yield success in locating both historical and new gold zones.</p><p>During our continued phase one exploration program our geologists have discovered physical evidence of extensions of parallel gold zones. One adit we believe is known as the Goldwin zone, as reported by F. Leland, Mining Engineer, in a report dated April 15, 1935. Recently reported modeling from the Company's available data identified a soil anomaly which was assumed to represent the Goldwin parallel vein. This has now been verified with the physical discovery of the location of the Goldwin zone. Additionally, two other shafts were discovered along the Providence trend. These workings are believed to be part of south extensions of the Providence. As previously reported, nearly all historical mine plans and sections for the Providence mine were consumed in a forest fire that destroyed the mill complex in 1918.</p><p>The Company has now completed both hard rock and soil sampling along the known gold trend. Assay results are now pending.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>John M. Kowalchuk, P.Geo, a geologist and qualified person (as defined under NI 43-101) has read and approved the technical information contained in this news release. Mr. Kowalchuk is a senior geologist consulting to the Company.</p><p>The Company will be displaying rock samples at the San Francisco Gold and Silver Summit at the Hilton Hotel on November 20 and 21st.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</p><p>\"Ronald Coombes\" Ronald Coombes, President &amp;CEO Telephone: 1-604-602-4935 Facsimile: 1-604-602-4936 Contact: Robert Eadie Ronald Coombes Mobile: 1- 604-724-2369 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rcoombes@providencegold.com\">rcoombes@providencegold.com</email></p><p>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2017 Market News Publishing Inc.

As of press time all are under half of an hectare in size and are not threatening any structures or communities. Personnel and aircraft are currently fighting those fires.</p><p>In addition to those, several fires are burning on the east side of Arrow Lake.</p><p>A fire at Mount Marshall five km southeast of Burton is being held by an initial attack crew.</p><p>A fire at Miller Creek, 10 km east of Burton is spot-fire sized.</p><p>An older fire at Woden Creek is 100 per cent contained and crews are patrolling for flare-ups.</p><p>None of the fires in the region are large enough to be causing the smoke that has moved into the area. IfdsZt is coming from the larger fires in the Kamloops and Cariboo regions.</p><p>\"The public can expect to see more smoky skies as the wind prevails from the west,\" said Shaughnessy.</p><p>With no significant precipitation in the long-term weather forecast, conditions are expected to worsen.</p><p>A complete fire prohibition remains in effect for the entire fire centre. Anyone going into the backcountry is urged to use extreme caution, especially if operating off-road vehicles as their exhaust systems can and do start forest fires.</p><p>If you see smoke coming from the forest, or a fire, call the forest fire reporting line at 1-800-663-5555 or *5555 on your cell phone.</p><p>Updated fire information can be found at bcwildfire.ca .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARLNWS-3397960</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARLNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P1H-P391-JDH3-G21Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438269</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Arrow Lakes News (Nakusp)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 14, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Cellular Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBFODkzRTVGMjcxNEJEMkE5OEJERjZBMDUyQ0JBOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODgzMzVFMEM4REFFNDc0MTg3NUU4OUEwQzE4MDBGRUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They have tried to make this election only about gay-straight alliances and LGBTQ issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prior to the 2015 election, Notley, Phillips, Eggen, just to mention three, were all rabid anti-oil and anti-pipelines. Paris 2015, Notley proudly stood with Trudeau to launch the attack on coal-fired power plants and oilsands. 2016, a suspicious human-caused forest fire starts outside Fort McMurray, with delays in firefighting. Later, both Notley and Trudeau refused multiple foreign offers of large water bombers. Why?</p><p>NDP changed the Municipal Government Act so that more school tax could be charged on residences and farmland to be passed on to government unions. ATA whines about lack of money and class size but has constant TV and media ads costing how much, millions? NDP brought in Bill 6 and the carbon levy with very invasive powers. Notley gave oilsands CEOs massive exemptions, in exchange they endorse the carbon tax. They never even had to make any commitment to clean-up and eliminate the tailings ponds. Yet when Stelmach wanted a royalty increase, guess who got him out and Redford in.</p><p>When I attended anti-Bill 6 and anti-carbon tax rallies, we were not allowed within 75 feet of the front legislature steps. The musical chimes were put on to try to drown out speeches, no public address system was allowed. I counted over 40 city cops and Alberta sheriffs plus paddy wagons were on site. Yet when government unions held rallies on the legislature grounds, they could be up on the front steps and were given government microphones and P.A. systems to use. There was little if any police presence.</p><p>The NDP brought in drug injection sites that enables drug users. Where do they get their money for street drugs? Crime, easy targets, go to rural areas. Fentanyl drugs are also fueling BC's real estate/money laundering economy. Even when a trafficker is caught with over 27,000 fentanyl pills and admits guilt, a liberal judge lets him off. The Leftists won't go after criminal's and their illegal guns, instead, Leftists want to take away law-abiding citizens' guns.</p><p>While tens of thousands of Albertans go without any income, lose homes and businesses, government union employees that have job security, pensions and health plans, they have not even had to take a pay cut! Liberal David Khan, Ryan Jespersen and his buddy Stephen Carter (former Redford chief of staff who received $130,000 of severance pay for six months \"work') are calling for a sales tax. There exists a government spending problem. We don't need to hand over more money! Shannon Phillips and the NDP want to push through the American Y2Y agenda by starting with the Bighorn Park.</p><p>I want an MLA that has moral ethics, one who listens to your concerns, cares about the economy and jobs so we can afford healthcare and education, one that supports parent's rights to know what's going on in school and what they are being taught in school.</p><p>To the NDP and Leftists, your smear campaign was just that! I have voted and will still vote for Mark Smith.</p><p>Exercise your right to vote while we still have the right to vote!</p><p>Ron Wurban,</p><p>Calmar</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PIPFLY-3781653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PIPFLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW7-BYY1-F103-32YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459605</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pipestone Flyer</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS4K</classCode><className>CARBON TAX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp;

If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, contact your health care provider: difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, and sudden onset of cough or irritation of airways. Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, and lung or heart disease.</p><p>This advisory will remain in effect until further notice.</p><p>Tips to reduce your personal health risk:</p><p>People with heart or lung conditions may be more sensitive to the effects of smoke and should watch for any change in symptoms that may be due to smoke exposure. If any symptoms are noted, affected individuals should take steps to reduce their exposure to smoke and if necessary see their physician. People with symptoms should go to their health care provider, walk in clinic or emergency department depending on severity of symptoms.</p><p>Use common sense regarding outdoor physical activity - if your breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.</p><p>Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.</p><p>blackpress.tv</p><p>Early Saturday morning a helicopter was retrieving water from the lake to attack the fire above Coyote Rock.as seen in this video, while crews at the Williams Lake Fire Department prepare for another day and a father evacuated from Lac La Hache and his son from Williams Lake stock up on groceries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-3393920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P07-VP51-JDH3-G0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Williams Lake Tribune Advisor</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 8, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N621399CC</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001481</classCode><className>RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N622000MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY ROOMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000671</classCode><className>EXERCISE &amp; FITNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000486</classCode><className>DIABETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000C4A1</classCode><className>HEART DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000CMP5</classCode><className>INFANTS &amp; TODDLERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N621399CC</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N622000MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY ROOMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX002149</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009T96</classCode></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Although the Liberals' next budget is still months away, the coalition's wish list is normally released during the fall budget planning season.</p><p>This year, the group is hoping the added momentum for taking action on climate change, emanating from this year's election campaign, gives a little more oomph to their demands.</p><p>The 72-page green budget document says Canada has to use the next federal budget to step up climate action with actual dollars that show the Liberals truly understand the urgency of the situation.</p><p>\"Climate change is a massive issue and we need to scale up action on the climate emergency,\" said coalition manager Andrew Van Iterson.</p><p>Hundreds of scientists say the world has to cut global greenhouse gas emissions almost in half by 2030, and to net zero by 2050, in order to prevent the world from getting so warm there will be no way to stop the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Net zero means that all the emissions being produced are absorbed by natural sinks like forests, or technology like carbon capture and storage.</p><p>The green budget suggests the next federal budget invest in a number of energy efficiency upgrades, including $200 million over three years to train workers how to build energy efficient homes and buildings, $200 million over five years to install fuel-saving devices on heavy trucks, and $85 million in 2020 alone to help cities buy zero-emission buses.</p><p>They also want a massive increase in how much Canada is contributing to global climate finance efforts, where wealthier countries help developing countries and smaller nations respond to climate change and find ways to reduce their own emissions. Such financing was a part of the Paris climate change accord, and in 2015, Canada committed $2.65 billion over five years to the effort.</p><p>The green budget says Canada needs to scale that up to $2.9 billion a year. The groups say that would be a share of the global pool of climate financing equal to Canada's share of global emissions.</p><p>But for the first time in its 20-year history, the Green Budget Coalition is putting a heavy focus on trying to get Ottawa to acknowledge and budget for what climate change is already costing Canadians.</p><p>The 2019 budget, they note, only included $130 million for disaster financial assistance in 2019 and 2020 to help provinces and territories cope with the increasing number of large-scale natural disasters, even though the program has been spending at least three times that every year.</p><p>A 2017 report from Public Safety Canada found the program averaged more than $360 million a year between 2011 and 2016 and the parliamentary budget officer estimated the program would average more than $900 million a year between 2016 and 2020.</p><p>\"That just seems like bad planning,\" said Gage. \"You can't just pretend these costs don't exist.\"</p><p>Eastern Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick experienced major floods in two of the last three years, costing insurance companies and governments hundreds of millions of dollars.

Five days later the fire spread, eventually covering 5,500 hectares.</p><p>The fire cost $5.5 million to fight and required aid from Canadian Armed Forces and an estimated 650 provincial firefighters.</p><p>Public outcry about the ministry's handling of the fire came to a head at a public meeting shortly after the July 24 evacuation when residents said they were not warned of the danger and the ministry didn't do enough to stop the blaze.</p><p>MacCallum said he will be in Penticton during the last week of November to listen to public concerns, although no public hearing will be held.</p><p>He said he hopes to have all the interviews done before Christmas with a report ready for the ministry by the end of February.</p><p>\"The ministry has expectations that the review will go public,'' he said.</p><p>MacCallum specializes in forest industry consultant work but said his expertise is not in forest fires.

CTV meteorologist David Spence is with us again tonight. David, what do the next 24 hours look like there?</p><p>DAVID SPENCE (Calgary): Well, Lisa, the outlook is not favorable for the firefighters at all. As we mentioned last night, we had a cold front going through the area, and it did produce some rain, but that rain was too far south to do any good. This is the fire area right here. In fact this return on the radar is ash from the forest fire, it is not actual rain. Following the passage of that cold front, the winds shifted more to the northwest, and tomorrow it's going to come out of the west and pick up in the afternoon, 20 gusting to 40 kilometres an hour. They're not going to get any rain. They are going to get some wind. And temperatures, though, still remaining lower than they were a few days ago, are going to start to climb, and by Saturday could be right back into the high 20s. So, meteorologically, it looks like conditions are going to get worse over the next couple of days. Lisa.</p><p>LAFLAMME: All right. Not the news anyone was hoping for. David Spence in Calgary tonight.

Let's see if we can finish the job,\" he said, adding that firefighters had managed to stop the advance of the flames in hard-to-reach areas. Light rains overnight raised humidity levels, aiding the battle against the blazes which the authorities suspect were deliberately started.But Costa warned winds were expected to pick up in the afternoon, which could complicate the task.Portugal's civil protection agency had said on Monday morning the wildfires were \"90 percent controlled\", but strong winds fanned the flames into life again in the afternoon.At least 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) have so far been scorched, according to the EU's European Forest Fire Information System.Nearly 1,300 firefighters were still deployed, Portugal's civil protection agency said Tuesday.- 'Few means' -Many local residents and mayors of the villages in the affected area have complained that not enough firefighters have been deployed to fight the flames.\"It's not that there weren't any firefighters but since the blaze was very big, there were few (resources) for this fire,\" the mayor of the town of Vila de Rei, Ricardo Aires, told public broadcaster RTP earlier this week.But Costa said adequate resources had been deployed to fight the blaze and recalled that firefighters were also needed to fight smaller outbreaks in other parts of the country.\"We don't have infinite means to use. </p><p>We have to know how to manage them. If there are needs in another part of the country, we have to deal with those situations,\" he said. Two aircraft sent by Spain on Monday following a request from Lisbon were not as yet being deployed to fight the fire on Tuesday, Costa added without saying why.Some 650 firefighters were battling dozens of other smaller fires in other parts of drought-hit Portugal on Tuesday, according to the civil protection agency's website.Thirty-nine people including several firefighters have been injured since the wildfires broke out in Castelo Branco, with most suffering smoke inhalation, according to emergency service INEM.A farmer who reportedly sustained serious burns as he tried to protect his tractor from the flames was evacuated to a Lisbon hospital on Sunday.- 'Problems with forest' -The centre of Portugal is hilly and covered in dense forest and is regularly ravaged by fires, including the deadliest in the country's history when 114 people died in two separate blazes in June and October 2017. Much of the population in the area is elderly, as young people move to the cities.The forests are largely eucalyptus, a highly flammable wood used in the paper industry. Despite the combustion risks, the trees are planted because they are fast-growing and a major source of income for locals.With fields and pastures abandoned, the forests are poorly maintained, and the dense undergrowth facilitates the spread of the fires.\"We continue to have problems with the Portuguese forest, because of the species that exist, the small plots of land which don't encourage good management,\" Domingos Xavier Viegas, an expert on forest fires in Portugal at the University of Coimbra, told AFP. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031563887246774251764100051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMT-2KX1-JCMN-Y33V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001424</classCode><className>PUBLIC BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX261</classCode><className>LISBON, PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR169</classCode><className>SOUTHERN EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We are going to have a complicated day. </p><p>The wind has been the great motor of this fire,\" he said, adding the fire is still active \"mainly in hard to reach areas\".Smoke from the wildfires was visible from space, satellite images broadcast on Portuguese television showed.Around 30 people, including eight firefighters, have been injured, mostly from smoke inhalation, from the blaze which broke out on Saturday amid scorching temperatures, according to the interior ministry. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on Sunday visited a badly burned civilian who was evacuated by helicopter to a Lisbon hospital. In a message, he expressed his \"solidarity with the hundreds fighting the scourge of the fires\".- Man arrested -While a number of small villages were evacuated as a precaution, officials said they still did not know how many homes were burned by the flames.Authorities are looking into whether the fires may have been started deliberately, Interior Minister Eduardo Cabrita said Sunday. \"The cause of the fires is being investigated... there's something strange. How is it that five such large fires broke out in areas that are so close to each other?\" he asked.  Police said a 55-year-old man had been arrested in Castelo Branco suspected of setting a fire on the outskirts of the town, though this one was far from the main infernos.The army dispatched 20 soldiers and machinery to open routes \"to facilitate access\" for the firefighters.Seven regions of Portugal were on fire alert on Monday because of the dry weather and high temperatures, which are forecast to hit nearly 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Castelo Branco.- 'Terror returned' - \"Unfortunately terror returned once again. Enough. We are fed up,\" Ricardo Aires, the mayor of the municipality of Vila de Rei which was badly affected by the wildfires, told public television RTP.The centre of Portugal is hilly and covered in dense forest and is regularly ravaged by fires, including the deadliest in the country's history when 114 people died in two separate blazes in June and October 2017.Much of the population in the area is elderly, as young people move to the cities.The forests are largely eucalyptus, a highly flammable wood used in the paper industry. Despite the combustion risks, the trees are planted because they are fast-growing and a major source of income for locals.With fields and pastures abandoned, the forests are poorly maintained, and the dense undergrowth facilitates the spread of the fires. According to the EU's European Forest Fire Information System, more than 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres) of land was destroyed by fire across Europe between January and April this year, compared with 181,000 hectares recorded for the entire fire season in 2018. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903156380082404825176900104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMK-3DW1-JCMN-Y2G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

A half-dozen Canada Customs officers from the Chief Mountain border crossing had to be roused and evacuated at about 5:30 a.m. The approaching fire forced them to evacuate via the U.S.</p><p>\"The fire was probably a few (kilometres) away but it was coming fast,'' she said.</p><p>Lightning likely ignited the fire Saturday on Sofa Mountain in the southeastern part of the park which, with Glacier National Park in Montana, forms an international peace park that is considered a world heritage site.</p><p>During the day, winds of up to 80 kilometres per hour pushed the fire eastward along the U.S.-Canada border, said Smith.</p><p>Smith didn't know how many campers were evacuated early Wednesday from Belly Creek campground, a primitive camping area and one of several in the park, but thought it was less than 50.</p><p>\"Kind of a rude awakening in the morning, I guess, for those folks, although the ones I talked to were fascinated, actually,'' Smith said.</p><p>\"They got a pretty up-close look at the fire as they were being evacuated. That fire is quite spectacular because it's crowning.''</p><p>Crowning means the fire is spreading by jumping from treetop to treetop.</p><p>Smith said park officials were letting the fire burn because it was too dangerous to fight on the ground.

Day long weekend for illegal campfires.</p><p>It was a slap in the face.</p><p>Even now, with fires burning in every corner of the province, people are still not taking the precautions that are not only common sense, but are actually required by law. Why aren't people getting it?</p><p>There were 465 wildfires burning by Friday of last week, with more than 2,500 firefighters engaged in trying contain them, if not put them out entirely.</p><p>Lightning has caused some, but far too many, including the wildfire burning on Maple Mountain in Crofton, have been caused by people and their carelessness.</p><p>Dropped cigarette butts are frequent culprits, as are those illegal campfires. Then there are the absolute idiots who do things such as send open flames lanterns floating up into the sky without any thought to where they're going to come down. No, we're not kidding. That actually happened in Qualicum Beach last week. It was only extreme luck that a fire wasn't started.</p><p>What will it take for people to both take the fire risk seriously, and connect their own behaviour to that risk? There seems to be a disconnect. A \"that won't happen to me\" feeling. But it can happen to you. It's happening all over the province. Even before the wildfire broke out in Crofton we were all breathing the smoke from these fires. The fire at Nanaimo Lakes was 179 hectares on Friday. Port Alberni has had three wildfires to deal with.</p><p>Maybe people will take this seriously: fines for breaking campfire bans are $1,150. Think that's extreme? Try paying for the cost of fighting a wildfire. We're currently at a total bill this year of $170 million and counting. Last year's record-breaking fire season cost the province $564 million. That hits us all in the pocketbook come tax time.</p><p>We've so far been very fortunate that our one wildfire in the Cowichan Valley hasn't devoured any homes. All too often people's lives are turned upside down with evacuations, only to learn that almost everything they have has been lost to the flames. Imagine losing everything from your clothing to your furniture, to your photos.</p><p>We're nowhere near the end of fire season yet. We implore everyone to make sure that our forest fire count in the Cowichan Valley stays at one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-3643290</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T26-60R1-JDH3-G41P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Cowichan Gazette</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 15, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp; PENALTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The ban came into effect two weeks earlier on July 17, amid a spell of extremely dry weather and a string of other fires in the region. No fireworks and campfires - even for cooking and warmth - are allowed in Muskoka under the ban. However, that didn't stop somebody from lighting a fire at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening, at the same time emergency crews were battling the massive Milford Bay forest fire and coordinating the evacuation of nearly 50 homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After receiving the call about a burning complaint, the Muskoka Lakes Fire Department had to allocate one truck from its Foot's Bay station to deal with the additional headache. At that point, the volunteer fire department already had crews from four other stations deployed in Milford Bay, and had called in an additional tanker truck from Bracebridge as backup. Although the burning complaint was quickly snuffed out, Muskoka Lakes fire chief Richard Hayes said the situation could easily have become much more complicated. \"With people not heeding the burn ban, we could have ended up with a whole other big fire just like we had in Milford Bay,\" he said.</p><p>Hayes said his department still had enough strength to offer coverage to the rest of the township without pulling resources away from Milford Bay. However, Hayes acknowledged that the potential for manpower issues was certainly there if things got more complicated.</p><p>\"Any time that we've got an event, the potential is always there to stretch the manpower,\" he said. \"This one (the burning complaint) started really small and took off like wildfire, so the potential was certainly there.\" Though details are currently scant about the cause of the Milford Bay fire, Hayes told this newspaper that firefighters suspect it was caused by human activity.</p><p>Bracebridge has also had similar problems with people not taking the fire ban seriously. Fire chief Murray Medley said his department has been dealing with what appears to be a prank on a Vankoughnet fire information billboard. Twice already, someone has stolen a sign on the billboard that tells passing motorists that a fire ban is in effect. Someone has also been altering a needle on the billboard's fire danger rating display from \"extreme\" to \"low.\" Though the cost of replacing the fire ban sign is small, Medley said the department is more concerned the prank is giving locals a mixed message about the fire ban. \"It's just rather confusing for the general public. The media has been great with us as far as keeping the message out there on the forefront, but now we've got somebody here that's going around giving exactly the opposite sort of impression.\" Medley invites anyone with information on the billboard alterations to call the fire department at 705-645-8258. As with Muskoka Lakes, Bracebridge has also had its share of burning complaints.</p><p>\"We took a truck out to douse a fire that somebody had inadvertently left over the weekend,\" said Medley. \"I guess they didn't realize they couldn't burn and they left something burning there that actually got down into the ground, and we had to take a truck out and dump a load of water on it.\" Since the fire ban was imposed, the Huntsville department has recorded over 200 calls about people breaching it. Even before the fire ban came into effect, the Muskoka Lakes Fire Department found itself attending four separate fires over the course of five days beginning on Friday, July 13. Two were linked to campfires. A third, which grew to engulf about six acres of brush, was traced to the burning of debris. Immediately after the fire ban was imposed, the Huntsville and Lake of Bays fire departments fought a grass fire on Pine Ridge Road on Wednesday, July 18. Things continued to get worse this week. Just one day before the Milford Bay blaze, Huntsville firefighters had to call in a provincial water bomber to assist in dousing a forest fire in Port Sydney, which ended up engulfing three acres of brush.</p><p>Within hours of that incident, Gravenhurst firefighters went toe-to-toe against another forest fire near the tree museum on Doe Lake Road. In both cases, firefighters had to return the following morning to mop up. Earlier that same day, the Bracebridge Fire Department made quick work of a fire that completely destroyed a pickup truck at the Cottage Country General Store in Uffington.</p><p>Firefighters from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Parry Sound were also busy battling a number of fires in other regions of cottage country, including a large forest fire that broke out at around the same time as the Milford Bay blaze. That fire forced the evacuation of a First Nations reserve near Parry Sound. Hayes reminds residents that the fire ban is no joke. \"What seems to be a little thing can become very, very big real fast,\" he said. \"With these fires, what we're noticing is that they're going really deep and travelling very fast, and so it's important to heed the warnings.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2012072820761464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5674-F8T1-F197-52Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Day long weekend for illegal campfires.</p><p>It was a slap in the face.</p><p>Even now, with fires burning in every corner of the province, people are still not taking the precautions that are not only common sense, but are actually required by law. Why aren't people getting it?</p><p>There were 465 wildfires burning by Friday of last week, with more than 2,500 firefighters engaged in trying contain them, if not put them out entirely.</p><p>Lightning has caused some, but far too many, including the wildfire burning on Maple Mountain in Crofton, have been caused by people and their carelessness.</p><p>Dropped cigarette butts are frequent culprits, as are those illegal campfires. Then there are the absolute idiots who do things such as send open flames lanterns floating up into the sky without any thought to where they're going to come down. No, we're not kidding. That actually happened in Qualicum Beach last week. It was only extreme luck that a fire wasn't started.</p><p>What will it take for people to both take the fire risk seriously, and connect their own behaviour to that risk? There seems to be a disconnect. A \"that won't happen to me\" feeling. But it can happen to you. It's happening all over the province. Even before the wildfire broke out in Crofton we were all breathing the smoke from these fires. The fire at Nanaimo Lakes was 179 hectares on Friday. Port Alberni has had three wildfires to deal with.</p><p>Maybe people will take this seriously: fines for breaking campfire bans are $1,150. Think that's extreme? Try paying for the cost of fighting a wildfire. We're currently at a total bill this year of $170 million and counting. Last year's record-breaking fire season cost the province $564 million. That hits us all in the pocketbook come tax time.</p><p>We've so far been very fortunate that our one wildfire in the Cowichan Valley hasn't devoured any homes. All too often people's lives are turned upside down with evacuations, only to learn that almost everything they have has been lost to the flames. Imagine losing everything from your clothing to your furniture, to your photos.</p><p>We're nowhere near the end of fire season yet. We implore everyone to make sure that our forest fire count in the Cowichan Valley stays at one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-3643311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T26-60R1-JDH3-G42B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cowichan Citizen</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 15, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp; PENALTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They later analyzed what they collected in a lab.</p><p>The team went through more than 60 houses for the study.</p><p>The researchers were driven to perform their work after residents raised safety concerns in wake of the massive wildfire that forced 88,000 people from their homes. Chan said the research was believed to be the first to look for the retention of \"fire-derived pollutants\" indoors.</p><p>\"That's partly because these kinds of fires are rare and it's hard to mobilize quickly to go into the community to do the study,\" Chan said.</p><p>The research team was examining the house dust for the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are found in high concentrations in burned forests, and heavy metals that are found in high concentrations in ashes from burned buildings.</p><p>They found trace elements of the heavy metal arsenic in house dust in neighbourhoods that were heavily damaged by fire compared to non-damaged neighbourhoods, but the levels weren't above Alberta's health guidelines, Chan explained. The researchers found no evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Fort McMurray house dust.</p><p>\"We still don't know why, but we think maybe people did a very good job cleaning or maybe from this event there isn't that much of an impact indoors,\" Chan said. \"Whatever it is, it is minimizing the health risk.\"</p><p>He said he hopes his results informs rebuilding and recovery efforts after wildfires.</p><p>\"We expect this will be an important set of results for the future because there are likely going to be more wildfires because of climate change and difference in land uses,\" he said.</p><p>Chan and his team are working on several other related studies. They have gone back to Fort McMurray three other times to look at long-term levels of pollutants inside homes as well as seasonal effects.</p><p>They are also working with a lung specialist who is conducting a parallel study looking at the residents of the same houses Chan's team has examined.</p><p>\"The idea is to compare what's around you to what's in you,\" Chan said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-3729260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6P-C6N1-F103-3246-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Advocate</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Campbell expects water levels to return to more normal levels as the warm weather continues.</p><p>\"The extreme cold inhibited the run off and things are staying frozen longer,\" he said. \"Water that should have come down a month ago is just starting to come down now.\"</p><p>Campbell also said that the region's snowpack is sitting at about 78 percent of normal, something that could impact water levels later on in the summer.</p><p>\"It's hard to tell what will happen later on in the summer if there isn't a lot of precipitation,\" he said. \"Rain plays a big role and it's normally a very wet part of the world.\"</p><p>Bella Coola has received below half of its average monthly precipitation for February and March, and the dry trend is is predicted to continue to the end of the month.</p><p>\"It looks like we have had about 50mm of precipitation at the Environment Canada station at Bella Coola airport since February,\" said Campbell. \"Typically the location receives 164mm over February and March, so even with a small amount of rain in the forecast, we are in the 30 percent of normal range for combined February-March precipitation.\"</p><p>Other parts of the coast, such as Vancouver Island and Prince Rupert, have been experiencing similar trends. In the north, the situation is even more pronounced, with Prince George seeing just two millimetres of rainfall, compared to a monthly average of 30. In Fort St. John, just 0.2 millimetres has fallen, well below the monthly average of 24.</p><p>Provincewide the snowpack is sitting at an average of 89 per cent of normal levels, which may not be of much concern if precipitation levels throughout the summer are more normal.</p><p>Russ Hilland, a longtime resident and president of the Bella Coola Valley Watershed Conservation Society, says that he believes the inner Central Coast is experiencing a \"drought\" cycle related to climate change, which may continue for some time.</p><p>He also said that if people spot struggling salmon fry that may have been cut off from the larger river flow, the Bella Coola Watershed Conservation Society have volunteers that can relocate them to a safe place.</p><p>The last two forest fire seasons in B.C. have been the worst on record, with many expecting that trend to continue. A recent federal study pointed the finger at climate change, stating that \"wildfires that scorched vast tracts of southern British Columbia and led to forced evacuations in the summer of 2017 were stoked by climate change and are likely to become more common as global temperatures edge up.\"</p><p>B.C. already spent $668 million in 2017 to fight forest fires. In 2018, more than 13,000 square kilometres of the province was burned, surpassing the 2017 record of 12,161 square kilometres. Last week the province announced it is increasing the fire fighting budget by 58 percent to $101 million.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COASTM-3770189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COASTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRC-XKK1-JDH1-C4DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Coast Mountain News (Williams Lake)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2NF</classCode><className>AQUIFERS &amp; WATERSHEDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS8M</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(CP) _ Joan Thompson climbed out of her concrete basement and into the charred skeleton of the home she had moved into just three weeks ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This place is devastated,'' said the 70-year-old, who was married in the back yard last month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A ferocious forest fire forced Thompson and 300 other evacuees out of this village on Aug. 1 along with almost 10,000 others from surrounding communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last 3,500 were finally allowed to return Saturday _ some, like Thompson, to little more than ashes.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>CP</p></bodyText></section><p>Louis Creek took the brunt of the damage as the wildfire virtually levelled the village 50 kilometres northeast of Kamloops in south-central B.C.</p><p>Residents were warned earlier in the week there wouldn't be much to return to but Saturday brought them the first sight of what had been their homes.</p><p>\"I wasn't sure whether it would be all gone but what can you say, what can you do?'' Thompson said.</p><p>\"You get a little upset, you get a little choked.''</p><p>Down the road, the lumber mill that was the economic mainstay of the community, employing almost 200, is a mass of twisted, blackened metal.</p><p>Melted metal tables and warped file cabinets are all that remains of an eight-room office at the mill.</p><p>Ironically, bundles of lumber stacked inside an open drying kiln are untouched by the inferno.</p><p>On the highway into Louis Creek, a trailer park of about 12 homes is a graveyard of scorched shells, with a lone trailer perched on the hill standing unscathed.</p><p>A few hundred metres away, the bungalow of Mary and Harry Griffin remains undamaged, although a workshop, barn and a horse trailer on the property were destroyed.</p><p>Mary, 77, said she isn't happy the house survived.</p><p>\"I wish it had gone,'' she said. \"All the mess we've got to clean up, it's going to take us weeks.''</p><p>Inside the home, there's an overpowering stench of food that rotted over the past week after the power went down and the freezer cut out.</p><p>While the last 3,500 evacuees straggled home Saturday, crews worked to replace power poles and telephone lines and saw down charred, unsafe trees.</p><p>Rob Rutten lost his antique store in the fire.</p><p>\"It's heartbreaking,'' said Rutten, who will be filing an insurance claim for about $250,000.</p><p>\"It's my life. It's my occupation.''</p><p>Damage to properties in the Kamloops-area fires is $8.2 million so far, which includes the destruction of 39 houses, 26 trailer homes, 99 sheds and barns, as well as house contents. It doesn't include the Louis Creek sawmill, other businesses and hundreds of gutted vehicles.</p><p>The fire, which has consumed almost 200 square kilometres, started in the town of McLure, just south of Louis Creek.</p><p>Officials believe it started behind a highway cafe, likely by a cigarette. So far, RCMP have not laid charge, ruling it accidental.</p><p>Sweeping north through tinder-dry woods, the blaze first destroyed Louis Creek then advanced a few kilometres north to Barriere.</p><p>Barriere Fire Chief Al Kirkwood remained to fight the blaze. Most of the town was spared damage, but at a price.</p><p>\"The best way to describe it is if you've been to hell, well, I've been to hell and back,'' Kirkwood said of the experience.</p><p>Firefighters tirelessly worked for several days to protect Barriere, a town of 2,500. Only a few homes there burned to the ground as well as a few businesses _ a body shop, a model site for log homes and a mechanic's shop.</p><p>A makeshift recovery centre is set up at the community hall, where volunteers are handing out flashlights, hand soap, bottled water and garbage bins filled with brooms, gloves, paper towels and mops.</p><p>Upon returning home, Kalvin Fadar first watered the lawn, then downed a few beers with his neighbour in the back yard.</p><p>\"I'm absolutely, totally amazed the fire didn't get these fir trees,'' he said pointing to the 50-metre trees next to his home.</p><p>Gary Forsythe, a building contractor, figures business will soon be brisk.</p><p>\"At least we have a home to come back to,'' he said. \"The last thing I need is to build another house for myself.''</p><p>B.C. Deputy Fire Commissioner Bob Turley said the fire threatening the communities had been reduced to an acceptable scale. But it was still only 20 per cent contained and raging out of control Saturday in an unpopulated area northeast of Barriere.</p><p>Turley cautioned the area is still not out of danger so residents returning home will remain on evacuation alert.</p><p>Health officials warned residents allowed to return that thick smoke was creating poor air quality, to boil drinking water and to throw out freezer food because there had been no electricity for several days.</p><p>They were also asking people to load up with bottled water, fill their vehicles with gasoline and to bring home a bottle of bleach for the cleanup.</p><p>Parents with babies were also to bring a week's supply of diapers, and everyone was to ensure they had plenty of soap, a flashlight, batteries and enough food for two days.</p><p>\"It will likely be days before those retailers are inspected and even open,'' said Interior Health Authority spokesman Dan Ferguson.</p><p>B.C. Hydro said it expected that backup power for 4,000 people in the fire zone still without electricity would be on line by Sunday.</p><p>On Friday, another 3,000 people living in other small communities near Kamloops were allowed to return home.</p><p>After touring the region by air on Thursday, B.C. Forests Minister Mike de Jong announced that all evacuees could go back within 24 hours if it was deemed safe.</p><p>An official at an area emergency operations centre said Friday that politicians wanted to expedite the return of evacuees because they were sensitive to residents' plight.</p><p>\"They are all trying to get the suffering minimized of people as best they can, but not to compromise safety,'' said John Smith, director of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District's emergency operations centre.</p><p>\"What it was, was a desire to make it happen.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20030809CPCPG7230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:498B-55K0-01G6-9213-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"968\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>August 9, 2003 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT; POLITICS; HEALTH; FORESTRY;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N4493310M</classCode><className>ANTIQUE DEALERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DBAT</classCode><className>MOBILE HOMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>N321113MM</classCode><className>SAW MILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CY7S</classCode><className>TRAILER PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N321000CC</classCode><className>WOOD PRODUCTS MFG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N4493310M</classCode><className>ANTIQUE DEALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0008XZ0</classCode><className>INSURANCE CLAIMS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The initial press reports were that this fire was not deemed to be a threat to any buildings and property, and as such would be left to burn. The added caveat was that this might be considered a good thing, as accumulated forest debris would be cleared out and be less of a danger in the future.</p><p>The stated criteria to fight or not fight this new fire was clearly the immediate danger to property, or humans living in the immediate vicinity.</p><p>My question is this; what calculations are made to assess the potential air quality issues which might arise, from not deciding to jump on this fire? Who decides what amount of harmful smoke is OK for the Okanagan residents to breathe?</p><p>The AQHI ( air quality health index ) is a means to express the amount of fine particulate matter which is in the smoke we are having to breathe. As I look out my window this afternoon of August 10, 2018, there is a real cause for concern. The fact that my lungs are being significantly compromised because, last week, there were no barns or houses in immediate danger, begs a review of our current strategy and criteria to fight fires. The long-term health effects of smoke and ash in my lungs are as important as any building or structure.</p><p>Short term and long term effects from this horrific amount of smoke and fine particulate matter, are significant and have been well documented.</p><p>Citizens must become aware and engaged; press their elected MLA for information related to what amount of our tax dollars are being allocated to fight fires in this new normal of climate change.</p><p>Are sufficient tax dollars being prioritized to hire firefighters? Should we have more water bomber/tanker aircraft? Call your local MLA, write the ministers of forestry and environment, and express your concern. Be proactive, do this now; don't endure more years of this real and present health danger, to find you have permanent lung damage because someone else made the decision as to how much smoke you should tolerate.</p><p>W.

Passerby saw the fire and alerted the Sunshine Valley Volunteer Department, who are the closest fire department to a stretch of the highway which has no cellular service.</p><p>\"It just so happened that one of our firefighters was coming down the hill and (motorists) stopped him and said there was a fire. He radioed me, and I'd just got everybody paged out when somebody knocked on my door here,\" said fire chief Chris Terry. \"It was a very quick response, again. We were rolling before the third person even informed us about it.\"</p><p>Telus cellular micro-cells have recently been installed on Highway 3 in Sunshine Valley, Manning Park and East Gate, however cellular services does not extend to all portions of the highway. This makes alerting fire departments along this stretch a trickier and more informal process.</p><p>\"You've either got to turn around and report it back in Hope, or you've got to stop in at the resort here&amp;#8230;and then they'll page us out right from the resort,\" Terry said, referring to the Holiday Trails RV Resort in Sunshine Valley</p><p>The fire started in the vehicle and spread to the trailer, Terry confirmed. Engulfed in flames, both vehicles were close to the trees on the side of the highway in an area near where Sunshine Valley crews fought another forest fire July 30.</p><p>Seven members of the Sunshine Valley department, a water tender and a fire engine brought the fire under control within 15 minutes. The RCMP also attended, as did the BC Wildfire Service, but the fire was out by the time the wildfire fighters arrived.</p><p>Terry called Saturday's vehicle fire \"another close call\" as wildfires continue to engulf forests across B.C. Two large forest fires are burning in the region &amp;#8212; a 2,000 hectare lightning-caused fire in the Skagit Valley Provincial Park and a 120 hectare fire on Mt. Hicks above Highway 7 between Agassiz and Hope.</p><p>\"With more and more traffic using Highway 3 now, we're probably going to see more and more of it,\" Terry said. \"Especially the way the fire seasons are going. We're getting more fires, more intense fires.\"</p><p>Is there more to this story?</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@hopestandard.comLike\">news@hopestandard.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-3642314</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1S-6XD1-F105-610K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hope Standard</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 13, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00028PZ</classCode><className>TELUS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They later analyzed what they collected in a lab.</p><p>The team went through more than 60 houses for the study.</p><p>The researchers were driven to perform their work after residents raised safety concerns in wake of the massive wildfire that forced 88,000 people from their homes. Chan said the research was believed to be the first to look for the retention of \"fire-derived pollutants\" indoors.</p><p>\"That's partly because these kinds of fires are rare and it's hard to mobilize quickly to go into the community to do the study,\" Chan said.</p><p>The research team was examining the house dust for the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are found in high concentrations in burned forests, and heavy metals that are found in high concentrations in ashes from burned buildings.</p><p>They found trace elements of the heavy metal arsenic in house dust in neighbourhoods that were heavily damaged by fire compared to non-damaged neighbourhoods, but the levels weren't above Alberta's health guidelines, Chan explained. The researchers found no evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Fort McMurray house dust.</p><p>\"We still don't know why, but we think maybe people did a very good job cleaning or maybe from this event there isn't that much of an impact indoors,\" Chan said. \"Whatever it is, it is minimizing the health risk.\"</p><p>He said he hopes his results informs rebuilding and recovery efforts after wildfires.</p><p>\"We expect this will be an important set of results for the future because there are likely going to be more wildfires because of climate change and difference in land uses,\" he said.</p><p>Chan and his team are working on several other related studies. They have gone back to Fort McMurray three other times to look at long-term levels of pollutants inside homes as well as seasonal effects. </p><p>They are also working with a lung specialist who is conducting a parallel study looking at the residents of the same houses Chan's team has examined.</p><p>\"The idea is to compare what's around you to what's in you,\" Chan said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0546bae01023499cae20363dbc5774ea</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6N-GDM1-JBVR-3029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><timeReceived>02:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They later analyzed what they collected in a lab.</p><p>The team went through more than 60 houses for the study.</p><p>The researchers were driven to perform their work after residents raised safety concerns in wake of the massive wildfire that forced 88,000 people from their homes. Chan said the research was believed to be the first to look for the retention of \"fire-derived pollutants\" indoors.</p><p>\"That's partly because these kinds of fires are rare and it's hard to mobilize quickly to go into the community to do the study,\" Chan said.</p><p>The research team was examining the house dust for the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are found in high concentrations in burned forests, and heavy metals that are found in high concentrations in ashes from burned buildings.</p><p>They found trace elements of the heavy metal arsenic in house dust in neighbourhoods that were heavily damaged by fire compared to non-damaged neighbourhoods, but the levels weren't above Alberta's health guidelines, Chan explained. The researchers found no evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Fort McMurray house dust.</p><p>\"We still don't know why, but we think maybe people did a very good job cleaning or maybe from this event there isn't that much of an impact indoors,\" Chan said. \"Whatever it is, it is minimizing the health risk.\"</p><p>He said he hopes his results informs rebuilding and recovery efforts after wildfires.</p><p>\"We expect this will be an important set of results for the future because there are likely going to be more wildfires because of climate change and difference in land uses,\" he said.</p><p>Chan and his team are working on several other related studies. They have gone back to Fort McMurray three other times to look at long-term levels of pollutants inside homes as well as seasonal effects.</p><p>They are also working with a lung specialist who is conducting a parallel study looking at the residents of the same houses Chan's team has examined.</p><p>\"The idea is to compare what's around you to what's in you,\" Chan said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019011549090509</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6M-7R31-JDH1-C1MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The ban came into effect two weeks earlier on July 17, amid a spell of extremely dry weather and a string of other fires in the region. No fireworks and campfires - even for cooking and warmth - are allowed in Muskoka under the ban. However, that didn't stop somebody from lighting a fire at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening, at the same time emergency crews were battling the massive Milford Bay forest fire and coordinating the evacuation of nearly 50 homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After receiving the call about a burning complaint, the Muskoka Lakes Fire Department had to allocate one truck from its Foot's Bay station to deal with the additional headache. At that point, the volunteer fire department already had crews from four other stations deployed in Milford Bay, and had called in an additional tanker truck from Bracebridge as backup. Although the burning complaint was quickly snuffed out, Muskoka Lakes fire chief Richard Hayes said the situation could easily have become much more complicated. \"With people not heeding the burn ban, we could have ended up with a whole other big fire just like we had in Milford Bay,\" he said.</p><p>Hayes said his department still had enough strength to offer coverage to the rest of the township without pulling resources away from Milford Bay. However, Hayes acknowledged that the potential for manpower issues was certainly there if things got more complicated.</p><p>\"Any time that we've got an event, the potential is always there to stretch the manpower,\" he said. \"This one (the burning complaint) started really small and took off like wildfire, so the potential was certainly there.\" Though details are currently scant about the cause of the Milford Bay fire, Hayes told this newspaper that firefighters suspect it was caused by human activity.</p><p>Bracebridge has also had similar problems with people not taking the fire ban seriously. Fire chief Murray Medley said his department has been dealing with what appears to be a prank on a Vankoughnet fire information billboard. Twice already, someone has stolen a sign on the billboard that tells passing motorists that a fire ban is in effect. Someone has also been altering a needle on the billboard's fire danger rating display from \"extreme\" to \"low.\" Though the cost of replacing the fire ban sign is small, Medley said the department is more concerned the prank is giving locals a mixed message about the fire ban. \"It's just rather confusing for the general public. The media has been great with us as far as keeping the message out there on the forefront, but now we've got somebody here that's going around giving exactly the opposite sort of impression.\" Medley invites anyone with information on the billboard alterations to call the fire department at 705-645-8258. As with Muskoka Lakes, Bracebridge has also had its share of burning complaints.</p><p>\"We took a truck out to douse a fire that somebody had inadvertently left over the weekend,\" said Medley. \"I guess they didn't realize they couldn't burn and they left something burning there that actually got down into the ground, and we had to take a truck out and dump a load of water on it.\" Since the fire ban was imposed, the Huntsville department has recorded over 200 calls about people breaching it. Even before the fire ban came into effect, the Muskoka Lakes Fire Department found itself attending four separate fires over the course of five days beginning on Friday, July 13. Two were linked to campfires. A third, which grew to engulf about six acres of brush, was traced to the burning of debris. Immediately after the fire ban was imposed, the Huntsville and Lake of Bays fire departments fought a grass fire on Pine Ridge Road on Wednesday, July 18. Things continued to get worse this week. Just one day before the Milford Bay blaze, Huntsville firefighters had to call in a provincial water bomber to assist in dousing a forest fire in Port Sydney, which ended up engulfing three acres of brush.</p><p>Within hours of that incident, Gravenhurst firefighters went toe-to-toe against another forest fire near the tree museum on Doe Lake Road. In both cases, firefighters had to return the following morning to mop up. Earlier that same day, the Bracebridge Fire Department made quick work of a fire that completely destroyed a pickup truck at the Cottage Country General Store in Uffington.</p><p>Firefighters from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Parry Sound were also busy battling a number of fires in other regions of cottage country, including a large forest fire that broke out at around the same time as the Milford Bay blaze. That fire forced the evacuation of a First Nations reserve near Parry Sound. Hayes reminds residents that the fire ban is no joke. \"What seems to be a little thing can become very, very big real fast,\" he said. \"With these fires, what we're noticing is that they're going really deep and travelling very fast, and so it's important to heed the warnings.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2012072820761467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5674-F8T1-F197-52Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

How a beloved character may have helped fuel catastrophic fires</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First off, let's ditch \"the.\" It's officially \"Smokey Bear.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The definite article only got shoehorned in there in 1952, when his fame was snowballing and a pair of songwriters penned Smokey his own anthem. They jammed \"the\" into his name for the song's rhythm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second: know he only got his job because Bambi was contractually unavailable. Had Walt Disney been a little more open about loaning out his prancing cartoon deer for government work, Americans may have never heard of Smokey Bear or his famous catchphrase: \"Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Bambi had merchandise to hawk at the Magic Kingdom, so Smokey became the face of American forestry - and the longest-running public service campaign in the country's history.</p><p>This month Smokey is popping champagne bottles in celebration of his 74th birthday. But the milestone comes as the bear's legacy is sunk in doubt. Right now 110 wildfires are currently blazing through western states, charring more than 5.7 million acres, The Washington Post reported this week. The current damage total has already overlapped past years, syncing with a larger pattern of larger fires and longer fire seasons, according to The Post.</p><p>So as America burns, where's Smokey Bear?</p><p>The recent fires actually highlight an ongoing debate among ecologists about whether Smokey should shoulder some responsibility for the flames now regularly sweeping across natural lands. For much of the last century, Smokey was the pitchman for the federal government's aggressive wildfire suppression policy. That tactic, some scientists believe, may have contributed along with climate change to making American forests vulnerable long-term to combustion. They call it \"the Smokey Bear effect.\"</p><p>To understand the history of modern American fire prevention, you actually have to jump back to the terror and anxiety spilling over the country at the start of the Second World War. Before the war, fire policy was a regular topic of debate - stop fires or allow controlled burns? - among foresters in the west and southwest. But after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, forestry suddenly became a national security concern.</p><p>According to the federal government, in the spring of 1942 Japanese submarines popped up along the west coast and began shelling Santa Barbara, California. The enemy fire landed dangerously close Los Padres National Forest, igniting concerns among officials that a few well-placed enemy bombs could spark catastrophic fires along the Pacific Coast. The fear was compounded because most of the men who usually fought forest fires were overseas.</p><p>The government decided to launch a public campaign promoting hypervigilance among citizens to prevent wildfires. The early campaign, run by the co-operative Forest Fire Prevention, couched preventions in terms of the war effort. Posters warned \"Our Carelessness, Their Secret Weapon\" and \"Forest Fires Aid the Enemy.\" One image featured a forest blaze below the glaring (and frankly racist) caricatures of Japanese Supreme Military Leader Hideki Tojo and Germany's Adolf Hitler.</p><p>A popular poster from this early effort leveraged anthropomorphic cuteness, tapping Disney's Bambi (\"Please Mister, Don't Be Careless\") for a 1944 campaign. But Walt Disney only licensed its creation for a year. After Bambi's time was up, government organizers realized they needed a new cuddly face for prevention.</p><p>Smokey Bear, created by artist Albert Staehle, made his debut for the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service in August 1944. The first poster showed Smokey - decked out in his trademark wide-brimmed park ranger hat, pants, and standing on two legs - pouring a bucket of water over a campfire. \"Smokey says - Care will prevent 9 out of 10 woods fires!\" the caption boasted. By 1947, Smokey's tag line was updated: \"Remember ... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires.\"</p><p>Smokey was soon splashed on posters in parks, buses, roadsides, and on television and radio spots. In 1950, Smokey got a real-world counterpart when New Mexico firefighters battling a blaze discovered a black bear clinging to a charred tree. The animal was nursed back to health, named Smokey, and shipped off to the National Zoo in Washington. He lived there until his death in 1976 as a \"living symbol of forest fire prevention\" and \"an honest to goodness reminder of the danger of forest fires,\" actor William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy) said in a 1953 short film on the cub.</p><p>Smokey's public campaign has been incredibly effective. As Charles E. Little noted in a 1993 article in American Forests, when the federal government's fire prevention campaign began in the 1940s, fires regularly burned an average of 30 million acres nationally. By 1988, the U.S. was only seeing 7.4 million acres of damage.</p><p>But that success is the problem, according to some scientists.</p><p>The Smokey campaigns have fostered the idea that all fires are bad and preventable, critics argue. In reality, fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, regularly clearing out old growth. As University of California at Riverside professor Richard Minnich told Grist in 2016, the government campaign at the height of the Smokey era ignored fire as a natural occurrence.</p><p>\"Smokey Bear says, 'Only you can prevent forest fires,'\" Minnich told the website. \"Let's change that last part. Smokey Bear says, 'Only you can prevent earthquakes.' Or how about, 'Only you can prevent tornadoes' - except no one thinks that.\"</p><p>The result is more forest land packed with potential fuel when fires do strike. Most experts today feel controlled burns of forests are the most effective way to clear land and help the health of wildlife.</p><p>It's a reality the government itself has come to grapple with.</p><p>In a 2007 paper titled \"Be careful what you wish for: the legacy of Smokey Bear,\" two USDA Forest Service researchers noted the \"long-standing policy of aggressive wildfire suppression has contributed to a decline in forest health, an increase in fuel loads in some forests, and wildfires that are more difficult and expensive to control.\"</p><p>Smokey himself has been updated to reflect the more advanced position. In 2001, his catchphrase was updated to \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\" instead of forest fires. According to the bear's official bio, the change was \"in response to a massive outbreak of wildfires in natural areas other than forests and to clarify that Smokey is promoting the prevention of unwanted and unplanned outdoor fires versus prescribed fires.\"</p><p>Smokey continues to be the face of wildfire prevention, starring in a number of commercials in recent years featuring the bear schooling millennials in proper campfire prevention.</p><p>Still looking fit and healthy at 74, Smokey likely has his work cut out for him. As The Post reported this week, in the 1980s and 1990s, the average wildfire burned between 40 and 80 acres. This year's average fire now tops 130 acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-08/15/201847125138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-87W1-JDH3-G112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1146\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The fire quickly grew to 20 square metres, it was \"aggressively burning, and going up the trees\" stated Manning Park Resort supervisor Andy Boul&amp;#233;.</p><p>BC Parks rangers and the East Gate Fire Department joined Manning Park Resort staff to fight the blaze. They were assisted by the BC Wildfire Service, who provided a tanker truck carrying over 13,000 litres of water to the scene. Wildfire fighters later joined the response.</p><p>Crews fought the fire until midnight Sunday, and BC Wildfire followed up to make sure the fire did not reignite.</p><p>At the time, the resort and all campsites were full for the long weekend with approximately 400 guests and all 355 campsites occupied.</p><p>The cause of the fire hasn't yet been determined. Manning Park Resort general manager Vern Schram, who also fought the fire Sunday, said it was likely human-caused.</p><p>\"We are speculating from some recent garbage in the area of the fire, including an empty pack of cigarettes, that this was not caused by mother nature,\" he stated in a news release.</p><p>Luck was on the side of the firefighters as there was little wind and many people responding, but Schram stressed the fire is a \"near miss\" and emphasized the need for caution during summer months.</p><p>Sunday's fire comes just under a week after another small but quickly growing wildfire sparked along Highway 3 just south of the Hope Slide in Sunshine Valley.</p><p>Sunshine Valley fire chief Chris Terry echoed many of the same sentiments as Schram after the July 30 fire. He told The Hope Standard luck was on the side of the firefighters as the response was swift, with 16 firefighters attending, and there was very little wind.</p><p>Terry said the fire \"could have been a lot worse\": if conditions hadn't been in their favour, the fire could have burned an entire village in Sunshine Valley to the ground.</p><p>- With files from Andrea DeMeer</p><p>Related:</p><p>Highway 3 fire 'could have been a lot worse': Sunshine Valley fire chief</p><p>Editor's View: All it takes is a spark</p><p>Is there more to this story?</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@hopestandard.comLike\">news@hopestandard.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-3638921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0G-DFX1-F105-61BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hope Standard</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CA23</classCode><className>CAMPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001728</classCode><className>TOBACCO PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
