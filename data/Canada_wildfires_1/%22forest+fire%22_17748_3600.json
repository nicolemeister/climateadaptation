(AP) \u2014 Up to 2.4 million trees would be cut down as part of a project to prevent major wildfires in a federally protected New Jersey forest heralded as a unique environmental treasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Jersey environmental officials say the plan to kill trees in a section of Bass River State Forest is designed to better protect against catastrophic wildfires, adding it will mostly affect small, scrawny trees \u2014 not the towering giants for which the Pinelands National Refuge is known and loved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the plan, adopted Oct. 14 by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission and set to begin in April, has split environmentalists. Some say it is a reasonable and necessary response to the dangers of wildfires, while others say it is an unconscionable waste of trees that would no longer be able to store carbon as climate change imperils the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Foes are also upset about the possible use of herbicides to prevent invasive species regeneration, noting that the Pinelands sits atop an aquifer that contains some of the purest drinking water in the nation.</p><p>And some of them fear the plan could be a back door to logging the protected woodlands under the guise of fire protection, despite the state's denials.</p><p>\u201cIn order to save the forest, they have to cut down the forest,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, the retired former director of the New JerseySierra Club, calling the plan \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cOrwellian.\u201d</p><p>Pinelands Commissioner Mark Lohbauer voted against the plan, calling it ill-advised on many levels. He says it could harm rare snakes, and adds that he has researched forestry tactics from western states and believes they are ineffective in preventing large wildfires.</p><p>\u201cWe are in an era of climate change; it's incumbent on us to do our utmost to preserve these trees that are sequestering carbon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don't have an absolutely essential reason for cutting down trees, we shouldn't do it.\u201d</p><p>The plan involves about 1,300 acres (526 hectares), a miniscule percentage of the 1.1-million-acre (445,150-hectare) Pinelands preserve, which enjoys federal and state protection, and has been named a unique biosphere by the United Nations.</p><p>Most of the trees to be killed are 2 inches (5 centimeters) or less in diameter, the state said. Dense undergrowth of these smaller trees can act as \u201cladder fuel,\u201d carrying fire from the forest floor up to the treetops, where flames can spread rapidly and wind can intensify to whip up blazes, the state Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement.</p><p>A Pinelands commissioner calculated that 2.4 million trees would be removed by using data from the state\u2019s application, multiplying the percentage of tree density reduction by the amount of land affected.</p><p>The department would not say whether it believes that number is accurate, nor would it offer a number of its own. But it did say \u201cthe total number of trees thinned could be significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is like liquid gasoline in the Pinelands,\u201d said Todd Wyckoff, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, as he touched a scrawny pine tree of the type that will most often be cut during the project. \u201cI see a forest at risk from fire. I look at this as restoring the forest to more of what it should be.\u201d</p><p>Tree thinning is an accepted form of forest management in many areas of the country, done in the name of preventing fires from becoming larger than they otherwise might be, and is supported by government foresters as well as timber industry officials. But some conservation groups say thinning does not work.</p><p>New Jersey says the cutting will center on the smallest snow-bent pitch pine trees, \u201cand an intact canopy will be maintained across the site.\u201d</p><p>The state's application, however, envisions that canopy cover will be reduced from 68% to 43% on over 1,000 acres (405 hectares), with even larger decreases planned for smaller sections.</p><p>And scrawny trees aren't the only ones that will be cut: Many thick, tall trees on either side of some roads will be cut down to create more of a fire break, where firefighters can defend against a spreading blaze.</p><p>The affected area has about 2,000 trees per acre \u2014 four times the normal density in the Pinelands, according to the state.</p><p>Most of the cut trees will be ground into wood chips that will remain on the forest floor, eventually returning to the soil, the department said, adding, \u201cIt is not anticipated that any material of commercial value will be produced because of this project.\u201d</p><p>Some environmentalists fear that might not be true, that felled trees could be harvested and sold as cord wood, wood pellets or even used in making glue.</p><p>\u201cI'm opposed to the removal of any of that material,\u201d Lohbauer said. \u201cThat material belongs in the forest where it will support habitat and eventually be recycled\u201d into the soil. \u201cEven if they use it for wood pellets, which are popular for burning in wood stoves, that releases the carbon.\u201d</p><p>John Cecil, an assistant commissioner with the department, said his agency is not looking to make a profit from any wood products that might be removed from the site.</p><p>But he said that if some felled trees \u201ccould be put to good use and generate revenue for the taxpayers, why wouldn\u2019t we do that? If there\u2019s a way to do this that preserves the essential goals of this plan and brings some revenue back in, that\u2019s not the end of the world. Maybe you could get a couple fence posts out of these trees.\u201d</p><p>Created by an act of Congress in 1978, the Pinelands district occupies 22% of New Jersey\u2019s land area, is home to 135 rare plant and animal species, and is the largest body of open space on the mid-Atlantic seaboard between Richmond, Virginia, and Boston. It also includes an aquifer that is the source of 17 trillion gallons (64 trillion liters) of drinking water.</p><p>\u201cIt is unacceptable to be cutting down trees in a climate emergency, and cutting 2.4 million small trees will severely reduce the future ability to store carbon,\u201d said Bill Wolfe, a former department official who runs an environmental blog.</p><p>Carleton Montgomery, executive director of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, supports the plan.</p><p>The group said opponents are using the number of trees to be cut \u201cto (elicit) shock and horror,\u201d saying that by focusing on the number rather than size of trees to be cut, they \u201care quite literally missing the forest for the trees. The resulting forest will be a healthy native Pine Barrens habitat.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC\">www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a53a63f85ef664eb70df00af2d1c3bf8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66YB-B021-JBVR-33G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1072\"/><timeReceived>11:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 25, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The situation improved overnight,' local fire service spokesman Arnaud Mendousse said, saying that only 300 more hectares (740 acres) had burned since Tuesday evening. </p><p><br/>French President Emmanuel Macron is due to visit the fire-hit Gironde region where a total of 20,600 hectares (50,900 acres) of forest have gone up in flames since last week and 37,000 people have been evacuated. <br/>Temperatures have dropped from above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday to the mid-20s on Wednesday. <br/>'We've been able to really work on our defences against the fire,' local government official Fabienne Buccio told reporters Tuesday evening. 'We managed to improve, advance and create significant fire breaks.' <br/>'Cooler weather' had helped, she said, though the area was not expecting significant rainfall that would help extinguish the flames. <br/>The pine forests along the Atlantic coast were bone-dry after months of drought-like conditions that have affected the entire country. <br/>The biggest blaze is in a thinly populated area south of Bordeaux near the village of Landiras, which is being treated by police as suspected arson. <br/>A 39-year-old local man arrested on Monday was released overnight after investigators concluded 'the evidence and statements collected exonerated him.' <br/>He had been arrested but not charged in 2014 over a separate forest fire, the local prosecutor's office said in a statement. <br/>A second blaze has ripped through a popular ocean-front tourist area behind the Dune du Pilat, Europe's biggest sand dune, near the Bay of Arcachon. <br/>It is thought to have been caused by a van that caught fire last week. <br/>Macron is expected to meet members of the emergency services, local officials and volunteers as he tours the area Wednesday alongside Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;title=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20drops\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;linkname=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20dropshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Ffrench-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops%2Farticle&amp;title=French%20fires%20coming%20under%20control%20as%20heat%20drops</url><br/>The post French fires coming under control as heat drops[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/french-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops/article\">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/french-fires-coming-under-control-as-heat-drops/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

That would also be applicable for Township of Spallumcheen residents.</p><p>The exact timing of the planned burn will depend on weather and site conditions. The planned ignition was a no-go Thursday, Aug. 26, due to winds. If and when site conditions are favourable, additional information will be provided prior to ignition.</p><p>The recent and forecasted cooler weather with periods of rain has been assessed to ensure optimum conditions are present for a successfully planned burn event.</p><p>BC Wildfire crews completed a series of small-scale burns on the south and northeast flanks of the White Rock Lake wildfire which began Tuesday, a day ahead of schedule. According to BC Wildfire Service, crews continue to extinguish deep burning fuels that are persistent throughout the east flank and are making good progress on mop-up and patrol activities along the south, west and northern flanks.</p><p>The ignition was critical to securing the area east of the larger-scale planned ignition set to occur in the coming week.</p><p>Planned ignitions were used to secure the fire perimeter burning north of Terrace Mountain yesterday, Aug 25, and west towards the fire perimeter above Shorts Creek (along the southeast flank). The aerial ignitions removed approximately 600-hectares of fuel between the fire's edge and the pre-established control line.</p><p>The controlled burn was determined to be the best tactic in fighting the forest fire in the Irish Creek Road and Six Mile Creek area due to the steep and inaccessible terrain and the continued safety of firefighters.</p><p>READ MORE: Military on the move from Oliver to Vernon to combat White Rock Lake wildfire</p><p>READ MORE: VIDEO: Injured White Rock Lake firefighter arrives at Vernon airport</p><p>@VernonNews <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:roger@vernonmorningstar.comLike\">roger@vernonmorningstar.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KEMREV-4204941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KEMREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-W631-F103-33KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438251</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Keremeos Review (Okanagan Falls)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 26, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Forest fires continue to rage across British Columbia, threatening many of our rural communities, with many more expected throughout the season.</p><p>We have already seen the horrendous impacts these fires can have on our communities. I am truly at a loss for words over the devastation wreaked on our beautiful town of Lytton, as well as the tragic loss of life. People across the province are heartbroken for residents of Lytton who have lost everything.</p><p>I have spent the past few weeks traveling around the Fraser-Nicola region, and amidst the feelings of loss and grief, I was also met with an incredible feeling of hope when I saw how British Columbians and Canadians have come together to support those in need. The incredible work of our firefighters, emergency responders, local officials, and of course our many volunteers cannot be understated.</p><p>Many of our local farmers who have been working the land for generations have offered invaluable insight for our recovery, and will be an essential voice at the table for future forest fire prevention. Our region is also blessed to be home to many knowledgeable First Nations communities who have called this land home for thousands of years.

More than eight others were lightly injured, they added. <br/>Further north, firefighters in the Aragon region were battling another major blaze that broke out Saturday and has burnt more than 6,000 hectares of land, forcing at least 1,500 people from their homes. <br/>Meanwhile, a huge wildfire in central Portugal that raged for a week in a UNESCO-designated natural park and was finally brought under control on Friday night, flared up again Tuesday, the civil protection authority said. <br/>More than 1,200 firefighters had been drafted in to tackle the blaze, which has already consumed some 15,000 hectares and was 'burning fiercely' with the flames whipped up by strong winds, the authority said. <br/>- Worse than 2021 - <br/>So far this year,Spain has suffered 391 wildfires, fuelled by scorching temperatures and drought conditions, which have destroyed a total of 271,020 hectares of land, according to the latest figures from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). <br/>This year's fires in Spain have been particularly devastating, destroying more than three times the area consumed by wildfires in the whole of 2021, which amounted to 84,827 hectares, the figures show. <br/>Portugal has suffered 195 wildfires so far this year, which have ravaged 84,717 hectares of land, EFFIS figures show. <br/>Scientists say human-induced climate change is making extreme weather events, including heatwaves and droughts, more frequent and intense. They in turn increase the risk of fires, which emit climate-heating greenhouse gases. <br/>Fires have blazed across Europe, particularly in France, Greece and Portugal, making 2022 a record year for wildfires on the continent. <br/>The blaze in Portugal's Serra da Estrela natural park started on August 6 outside the central town of Covilha and authorities have deployed 373 fire engines and 12 planes and helicopters to bolster firefighters' attempts to tame it. <br/>The blaze has so far left three people seriously hurt and 19 others less seriously while 45 people have been evacuated as a precaution since Monday as Portugal battles its worst forest fires since 2017 when some 100 lives were lost.  <br/>Portugal's civil protection agency head Andre Fernandes warned of the probability the fire would spread and said attempts to stabilise it were liable to be hampered by wind. <br/><url

My legs were pretty tired.\"</p><p><br/><br/> Travel, tons of high-pressure hockey and the adrenalin of representing his home country took a toll on the recently turned 19-year-old.<br/><br/> But Mesar is hoping that's all in the past.<br/><br/> On Friday, he showed why the Montreal Canadiens selected him in the first-round of last year's NHL draft in Kitchener's 6-3 over the visiting Barrie Colts.<br/><br/> To be blunt: it was his best game as a Ranger.<br/><br/> \"He was attacking space, he looked confident with the puck, he held the puck more, made plays and was just excellent,\" said Blueshirts bench boss Chris Dennis.<br/><br/> And Mesar also scored his first marker since he potted a pair way back on Dec. 9.<br/><br/> \"I hope there will be more to come,\" he said.<br/><br/> As for Friday's score?<br/><br/> Well, to borrow a line from the classic movie The Wizard of Oz, \"pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.\"<br/><br/> The scoresheet read 6-3, but it felt like a 12-1 affair.<br/><br/> The Rangers were buzzing. They controlled the play, frustrated their foes and simply imposed their will to the delight of the 6,404 fans at the Aud.<br/><br/> The team now has four wins in its past six games with all the victories coming against some of the Ontario Hockey League's heavyweights in Saginaw, Ottawa, London and, now, Barrie.<br/><br/> The run has the Blueshirts up to eighth place in the OHL's western conference and back in a playoff spot for the first time in weeks.<br/><br/> There is a sense that the team, which loaded up with proven veterans for a run at the title, has arrived.<br/><br/> Dennis still wants to see more.<br/><br/> The sting of the team's recent seven-game losing skid no doubt still lingers at the back of his mind.<br/><br/> \"Oh, we're not going there yet,\" he said. \"We are definitely building some confidence and starting to look like the team we all hoped we would be. Things are starting to jell.\"<br/><br/> Beat a hard-working Erie Otters team on Saturday on the road in Pennsylvania and he might just be swayed a bit more.<br/><br/> \"It's going to be a challenge for us and we need to rise to that challenge,\" he said of Saturday's affair. \"We go in there and do a job in there, we can have the conversation of when we've arrived.\"<br/><br/> Rangers veteran Reid Valade scored twice in Friday's win and now has 17 goals in his past 17 games. Francesco Pinelli, Danny Zhilkin and Francesco Arcuri also scored while goalie Marco Costantini made 26 saves for the win.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JB's top three Rangers:</emphasis> Filip Mesar, Simon Motew, Marco Costantini<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brownie points:</emphasis><br/><br/> - Friday's tilt was the first official game at the Aud for Barrie defenceman Beau Akey, who hails from Baden. He played in a pre-season affair against the Rangers this past September. Akey came up with the Waterloo Wolves and is listed 25th overall among North American skaters on NHL Central Scouting's midterm rankings for this year's NHL draft.<br/><br/> - Dennis was an associate coach in Barrie last season and worked alongside current Colts GM/coach Marty Williamson. \"He was very gracious,\" said Dennis. \"It felt like we were really partners in what we were doing. He gave me a wonderful introduction to the league and taught me a lot.\"<br/><br/> - Kitchener's 2022 first round pick Michael Hage, whose rights were traded to Sudbury, still hasn't played a game this season due to injury.<br/><br/> - Was forwarded a rankings list of the best OHL media rooms before tonight's game. It raised a Spockian eyebrow in this chair. For what it's worth, my top five: Sault Ste. Marie, Saginaw, Kitchener, Erie, Oshawa. Bottom five: Sudbury, London, Windsor (used to be top three), Barrie, Niagara.<br/><br/> - D Simon Motew (hand) returned to action after missing the past eight games. F Adrian Misaljevic (upper body) is out after getting hit this past Sunday in London. F Trent Swick (upper body) also remains sidelined. He's missed the past five games and the team is hoping to get him back next week.<br/><br/> - Friday's game was the first time the Rangers have had their top seven defencemen all healthy and available since early December.<br/><br/> - Another backup goalie across the ice for Kitchener as Ben West got his second consecutive start for the Colts.<br/><br/> - We got smoked out at the Aud. Seems the second floor concession stand popcorn makers are letting the kernels swirl too long in the hopper. It was like a forest fire of smoke in the media room, which is a floor above said concession stand. I did work at a movie theatre as a teen if anyone needs any tips on how to perfect the pop. Just sayin'.<br/><br/> - Some nice drafting by Barrie on Beau Jelsma. The kid was a third-rounder and has 17 goals and 19 assists as a sophomore. Speed to burn. Thing I liked about him the most on Friday was his penalty killing. Constant effort and diving all over to break up passes. Hard not to like players that work their tails off.<br/><br/> - Dennis called a timeout with 1:40 left in the second period. The fourth line was outmatched and on a long shift, Barrie was buzzing and the trio had just iced the puck. With the break, Dennis was able to get the matchup he wanted. Smart.<br/><br/> - Sop didn't make my top three Rangers but was close. No points, but boy did he battle, especially in front of West in the third period. He was taking shots from defenders but stood his ground in what was a dominating period by the home side. Just a workhorse.<br/><br/> - The good times are back. But can they stay? We've seen Kitchener go on runs before, but this one feels different. Saginaw, Ottawa, London and Barrie are all upper echelon teams.<br/><br/> - So many encouraging signs for the Rangers - from all the big guns scoring or having impact games, to Motew returning with three helpers and a plus-four rating to Marco Costantini making massive saves. It was wave after wave of an attack tonight.<br/><br/> - Other things that stood out - Martin with three assists, Hamara plus four and Sop 5-for-6 on the dot.<br/><br/> Josh Brown is a Waterloo Region-based reporter focusing on sports for The Record.

My legs were pretty tired.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Travel, tons of high-pressure hockey and the adrenalin of representing his home country took a toll on the recently turned 19-year-old.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Mesar is hoping that's all in the past.</p><p>On Friday, he showed why the Montreal Canadiens selected him in the first-round of last year's NHL draft in Kitchener's 6-3 over the visiting Barrie Colts.</p><p>To be blunt: it was his best game as a Ranger.</p><p>\"He was attacking space, he looked confident with the puck, he held the puck more, made plays and was just excellent,\" said Blueshirts bench boss Chris Dennis.</p><p>And Mesar also scored his first marker since he potted a pair way back on Dec. 9.</p><p>\"I hope there will be more to come,\" he said.</p><p>As for Friday's score?</p><p>Well, to borrow a line from the classic movie The Wizard of Oz, \"pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.\"</p><p>The scoresheet read 6-3, but it felt like a 12-1 affair.</p><p>The Rangers were buzzing. They controlled the play, frustrated their foes and simply imposed their will to the delight of the 6,404 fans at the Aud.</p><p>The team now has four wins in its past six games with all the victories coming against some of the Ontario Hockey League's heavyweights in Saginaw, Ottawa, London and, now, Barrie.</p><p>The run has the Blueshirts up to eighth place in the OHL's western conference and back in a playoff spot for the first time in weeks.</p><p>There is a sense that the team, which loaded up with proven veterans for a run at the title, has arrived.</p><p>Dennis still wants to see more.</p><p>The sting of the team's recent seven-game losing skid no doubt still lingers at the back of his mind.</p><p>\"Oh, we're not going there yet,\" he said. \"We are definitely building some confidence and starting to look like the team we all hoped we would be. Things are starting to jell.\"</p><p>Beat a hard-working Erie Otters team on Saturday on the road in Pennsylvania and he might just be swayed a bit more.</p><p>\"It's going to be a challenge for us and we need to rise to that challenge,\" he said of Saturday's affair. \"We go in there and do a job in there, we can have the conversation of when we've arrived.\"</p><p>Rangers veteran Reid Valade scored twice in Friday's win and now has 17 goals in his past 17 games. Francesco Pinelli, Danny Zhilkin and Francesco Arcuri also scored while goalie Marco Costantini made 26 saves for the win.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JB's top three Rangers:</emphasis> Filip Mesar, Simon Motew, Marco Costantini</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brownie points:</emphasis></p><p>- Friday's tilt was the first official game at the Aud for Barrie defenceman Beau Akey, who hails from Baden. He played in a pre-season affair against the Rangers this past September. Akey came up with the Waterloo Wolves and is listed 25th overall among North American skaters on NHL Central Scouting's midterm rankings for this year's NHL draft.</p><p>- Dennis was an associate coach in Barrie last season and worked alongside current Colts GM/coach Marty Williamson. \"He was very gracious,\" said Dennis. \"It felt like we were really partners in what we were doing. He gave me a wonderful introduction to the league and taught me a lot.\"</p><p>- Kitchener's 2022 first round pick Michael Hage, whose rights were traded to Sudbury, still hasn't played a game this season due to injury.</p><p>- Was forwarded a rankings list of the best OHL media rooms before tonight's game. It raised a Spockian eyebrow in this chair. For what it's worth, my top five: Sault Ste. Marie, Saginaw, Kitchener, Erie, Oshawa. Bottom five: Sudbury, London, Windsor (used to be top three), Barrie, Niagara.</p><p>- D Simon Motew (hand) returned to action after missing the past eight games. F Adrian Misaljevic (upper body) is out after getting hit this past Sunday in London. F Trent Swick (upper body) also remains sidelined. He's missed the past five games and the team is hoping to get him back next week.</p><p>- Friday's game was the first time the Rangers have had their top seven defencemen all healthy and available since early December.</p><p>- Another backup goalie across the ice for Kitchener as Ben West got his second consecutive start for the Colts.</p><p>- We got smoked out at the Aud. Seems the second floor concession stand popcorn makers are letting the kernels swirl too long in the hopper. It was like a forest fire of smoke in the media room, which is a floor above said concession stand. I did work at a movie theatre as a teen if anyone needs any tips on how to perfect the pop. Just sayin'.</p><p>- Some nice drafting by Barrie on Beau Jelsma. The kid was a third-rounder and has 17 goals and 19 assists as a sophomore. Speed to burn. Thing I liked about him the most on Friday was his penalty killing. Constant effort and diving all over to break up passes. Hard not to like players that work their tails off.</p><p>- Dennis called a timeout with 1:40 left in the second period. The fourth line was outmatched and on a long shift, Barrie was buzzing and the trio had just iced the puck. With the break, Dennis was able to get the matchup he wanted. Smart.</p><p>- Sop didn't make my top three Rangers but was close. No points, but boy did he battle, especially in front of West in the third period. He was taking shots from defenders but stood his ground in what was a dominating period by the home side. Just a workhorse.</p><p>- The good times are back. But can they stay? We've seen Kitchener go on runs before, but this one feels different. Saginaw, Ottawa, London and Barrie are all upper echelon teams.</p><p>- So many encouraging signs for the Rangers - from all the big guns scoring or having impact games, to Motew returning with three helpers and a plus-four rating to Marco Costantini making massive saves. It was wave after wave of an attack tonight.</p><p>- Other things that stood out - Martin with three assists, Hamara plus four and Sop 5-for-6 on the dot.</p><p>Josh Brown is a Waterloo Region-based reporter focusing on sports for The Record.

That would also be applicable for Township of Spallumcheen residents.</p><p>The exact timing of the planned burn will depend on weather and site conditions. The planned ignition was a no-go Thursday, Aug. 26, due to winds. If and when site conditions are favourable, additional information will be provided prior to ignition.</p><p>The recent and forecasted cooler weather with periods of rain has been assessed to ensure optimum conditions are present for a successfully planned burn event.</p><p>BC Wildfire crews completed a series of small-scale burns on the south and northeast flanks of the White Rock Lake wildfire which began Tuesday, a day ahead of schedule. According to BC Wildfire Service, crews continue to extinguish deep burning fuels that are persistent throughout the east flank and are making good progress on mop-up and patrol activities along the south, west and northern flanks.</p><p>The ignition was critical to securing the area east of the larger-scale planned ignition set to occur in the coming week.</p><p>Planned ignitions were used to secure the fire perimeter burning north of Terrace Mountain yesterday, Aug 25, and west towards the fire perimeter above Shorts Creek (along the southeast flank). The aerial ignitions removed approximately 600-hectares of fuel between the fire's edge and the pre-established control line.</p><p>The controlled burn was determined to be the best tactic in fighting the forest fire in the Irish Creek Road and Six Mile Creek area due to the steep and inaccessible terrain and the continued safety of firefighters.</p><p>READ MORE: Military on the move from Oliver to Vernon to combat White Rock Lake wildfire</p><p>READ MORE: VIDEO: Injured White Rock Lake firefighter arrives at Vernon airport</p><p>@VernonNews <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:roger@vernonmorningstar.comLike\">roger@vernonmorningstar.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERNON-4204951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERNON2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-W631-F103-33KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

John Allen (Mayor):My first challenge will be to deal with planning at the OCP and zoning bylaw level. What is happening at the moment is a shambles and unacceptable to anyone with any love for this community. Monster garages with suites on lot lines, ugly development crowding Hot Springs Road, illegal secondary suites in the R1, single family zone, flooding and traffic chaos. These are all symptoms of a sick planning regime.</p><p>The problem could be lousy bylaws or bad administration. Perhaps both. It has to stop. I have 40 years of experience dealing with zoning bylaws and OCP bylaws throughout the Fraser Valley. I know how to fix and properly administer Harrison\u2019s bylaws . I will do so promptly in conjunction with elected councillors. My second priority is to mitigate the interface forest fire hazard. Prevention and good response planning will be followed by real progress on the Northern evacuation route. Handing this off to Kent hasn\u2019t worked. We need to take control and get it done. Instead of more committee meetings and consultants, we\u2019ll send a machine (probably an excavator) down the old forestry road through Sasquatch Park, the route I\u2019ve been advocating for about 30 years. We\u2019ll then see what\u2019s needed to open it up for northward evacuation access to Hwy #7. Maybe not much, as the road bed is still intact, just overgrown.</p><p>John Buckley (Council):Sustainability and accessibility.</p><p>1. Development has to be managed so the villages growth systems and infrastructure can maintain both the residents and the tourists who visit our beautiful village. As our population ages it is important to ensure that all public spaces remain accessible and usable for all residents.</p><p>Accessibility is also important for tourism, as there is a clear trend to ensuring destinations can be accessed by all.</p><p>To that end, I support the new visitor information centre which is striving to obtain the Rick Hansen Gold Standard of accessibility.</p><p>2. Support local businesses. It\u2019s because of them that our property taxes remain significantly lower than otherwise might be. As an official resort community, we receive provincial government resort municipality initiative (RMI) funds which amount to millions of dollars, paying for infrastructure and amenities along the waterfront and throughout our village that we could otherwise not afford.</p><p>Leo Facio (Council):My two highest priorities for the village are to be sustainable, also have more communication with the public and work on the emergency route.</p><p>Leslie Ghezesan (Council):To check where our tax money vanished as from 2018 went up $200 to $1,200 put this money to work for us.</p><p>Allan Jackson (Council):To ensure the Village remains economically sustainable. To ensure the right and concerns of the taxpayers are protected and heard.</p><p>Samantha Piper (Mayor):I still have a lot of work I wish to continue with Council. The two highest priorities initially are a Service Capacity Review (SCR) and the second is Relationship Building. An SCR will take a deep dive into sustainable service delivery. The scope of works will include a look inward and outward of the municipality\u2019s procedures and overall framework; the purpose and goal will be to establish sustainable efficiencies, long-term strategies, community needs, and future service planning for the betterment of the community as a whole. The SCR process will require time.</p><p>If developed systematically, it will ensure a comprehensive review is generated, resulting in purpose-driven governance, municipal efficiencies, and overall community well-being. Relationship building is critically important. Council not only represents the village while at the council table but also while advocating for the village in other settings. Relationships and partnerships are what will continue to move our community forward. Joint-effort projects; regional initiatives; community to community resourcefulness; government to government ingenuity. By working collaboratively, much more can be achieved with the outcome of mutual benefits.</p><p>Michie Vidal (Council):1. Housing needs are evolving. We are experiencing rapid growth, changing demographics and council must adapt. New residents and younger families re-vitalize our community and we must listen to their needs. Many of our seniors who have called Harrison home for many years are now considering downsizing and want to remain close to family and friends. We must find solutions and provide attainable housing for all ages. This can include incentives in partnership with programs provided by provincial and federal governments. We must continue to enhance our community where residents, businesses and visitors are provided with housing, amenities, infrastructure and programs to ensure a vibrant and thriving village.</p><p>2. We must continue to support the recommendations in our adopted Active Transportation Plan, Lagoon Master Plan, Parking Master Plan and our future Urban Forest Master Plan. These provide the justification when grant applications are submitted, and if awarded, provide upgrades and additions for the benefit of our community as a whole. Council has kept property taxes to modest increases. Grants provide the needed funding to ensure we have an active and safe community without the burden of substantial tax increases.</p><p>Ed Wood (Mayor):Build community spirit. Form committees and allow informal conversations by the public in village business, engage, listen, learn, and build. Quality of privacy in our homes. Ensure the draft OCP that allows for duplexes and coach houses to be built on presently zoned single home lots is not permitted.</p><p>Read the full Q&amp;A session online at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com\">www.agassizharrisonobserver.com</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGAHRO-news20221007PPDA0003040700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGAHRO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66JR-GPX1-F0HF-8428-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

It uses factors such as the relative humidity, temperature, previous 24-hour rain amount, wind directions and wind speed in combination with the forest fuel type and loads to determine the risk of the forest to certain fire types. From this calculation the Forest Fire Danger Rating is made in consultation with the Fire Chiefs of the six area municipalities and the Ministry of Natural Resources. The Muskoka fire season runs from April 1 to Oct. 31 each year. The rating is verified daily and updated whenever the rating changes. \\r\\n A Twitter List by MuskokaRegion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210708TMUW1125699592709045711749354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:633G-S9V1-JDV5-F0MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Thank you to them. European solidarity is at work!' President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. <br/>'Across the country over 10,000 firefighters and security forces are mobilised against the flames These soldiers of fire are our heroes,' he said. <br/>In total, 361 foreign firefighters were dispatched to assist their 1,100 French colleagues deployed in the worst-hit part of the French southwest. <br/>A first contingent of 65 German firefighters, followed by their 24 vehicles, arrived Thursday afternoon and were to go into action at dawn Friday, officials said. <br/>Among eight major fires currentlyraging, the biggest is the Landiras fire in the southwest Gironde department, whose forests and beaches draw huge tourist crowds each summer. <br/>It had already burned 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) in July \u2014 the driest month seen in France since 1961 \u2014before being contained, but it continued to smoulder in the region's tinder-dry pine forests and peat-rich soil. <br/>Since flaring up again Tuesday, which officials suspect may have been caused by arson, it has burned 7,400 hectares, destroyed or damaged 17 homes, and forced 10,000 people to quit their homes, said Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Mendousse of the Gironde fire and rescue service. <br/>Borne said nine firefighting planes are already dumping water on the blaze, with two more to be in service by the weekend. <br/>- 'California' - <br/>'We battled all night to stop the fire from spreading, notably to defend the village of Belin-Beliet,' Mendousse told journalists in Hostens. <br/>On several houses nearby, people hung out white sheets saying: 'Thank you for saving our homes' and other messages of support for the weary fire battalions. <br/>'You'd think we're in California, it's gigantic And they're used to forest fires here but we're being overwhelmed on all sides \u2014 nobody could have expected this,' Remy Lahlay, a firefighter deployed near Hostens in the Landes de Gascogne natural park, told AFP. <br/>With temperatures in the region hitting nearly 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) Thursday and forecast to stay high until at least Sunday, 'there is a very serious risk of new outbreaks' for the Landiras fire, the prefecture of the Gironde department said. <br/>Acrid smoke has spread across much of the southwestern Atlantic coast and its beaches that draw huge crowds of tourists each summer, with the regional ARS health agency 'strongly' urging people to wear protective face masks. <br/>The smoke also forced the closing of the A63 motorway, a major artery toward Spain, between Bordeaux and Bayonne. <br/>The government has urged employers to allow leaves of absence for volunteer firefighters to help fight the fires. <br/>In Portugal Thursday, more than 1,500 firefighters were also battling a fire that has raged for days in the mountainous Serra da Estrela natural park in the centre of the country.  <br/>It has already burned 10,000 hectares, according to the European Forest Fire Information System(EFFIS). <br/>burs/jh/tgb/har <br/><url

For those who aren\u2019t familiar with it, CCF an equal partnership between six the First Nations and two municipal governments created in 2016 to ensure the timber logging needs of Burns Lake.</p><p>According to General Manager Ken Nielsen, 2021 has been a positive year to date.</p><p>Nielsen told Lakes District News that, weather dependent, the company hopes to log over 100,000 cubic metres of timber by the end of this year. According to Nielsen, the CCF\u2019s financial return to its shareholders was high this year as well. \u201cThis fiscal year, we paid back $1,000,100,\u201d he said referring to a giant cheque that was displayed proudly at the entrance to the BBQ.</p><p>The CCF works with 5-7 subcontractors every year that do doing various jobs. Logging is the most prev-alent, but they also provide civil culture, tree planting and forest salvation services.</p><p>Surprisingly, the CCF\u2019s logging operations haven\u2019t been heavily affected by the forest fires this year. Nielsen stated that only 20 hectares have been impacted thus far from a combination of the Bulkley Lake and Grizzly Road wildfires. Compared to the 10,000 hectors lost in 2018, that number is extremely low given the amount of fires that have occurred in the province in 2021.</p><p>Moving forward for the company, they\u2019ll keep logging timber off their regular cutting permit. They\u2019ve applied for a new annual allowable cut permit which should be determined by October, though Nielsen believes it will go down from last year\u2019s.</p><p>The CCF will also continue work on their Forest for Tomorrow program, which addresses various forest health issues.

But, that is only a recent development brought on by the progress of global warming driven droughts.</p><p>According to the US Forest service, \"Historical and pre-settlement relationships between drought and wildfire have been well documented in much of North America, with forest fire occurrence and area burned clearly increasing in response to drought. This body of evidence indicates that the role of drought in historical and likely future fire regimes is an important contingency that creates anomalously high potential for ignition, fire spread, and large fire events.\" (Article: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/effects-drought-forests-and-rangelands\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/effects-drought-forests-and-rangelands</url>). The California and Australian forests did not experience these widespread fire losses before recent years.</p><p>Undesert is moving to capture gigaton quantity atmospheric carbon dioxide by afforesting idle deserts. The Undesert SmartFore.st\u2122, irrigated by patented solar powered desalination, is immune to drought because of the careful water planning integral to the design. The irrigated forest will also be managed to eliminate low-level brush and small trees as further mitigation of fire risk. The Undesert overall design even converts trimmed small limbs from the commercial forest operation to biochar. The biochar will recover 60 - 70% of the carbon in the limbs for site burial, while generating electricity to power operations.</p><p>The Undesert approach to carbon capture does not compete for land or water with other uses since the process feeds otherwise unusable saline/sea water on idle land. All salt is rendered to dry form to be sequestered onsite or converted to construction material. Note the key differences in our SmartFore.st\u2122</p><p>The Undesert SmartFore.st\u2122 is drought proof, fire resistant and pest resistant</p><p>Undesert Corporation is a Delaware C corporation in good standing based in Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA. Undesert's award winning Solar Wastewater Purification (SWAP) technology is a combination of Suns River (SR) solar desalination modules that use saline/wastewater to produce electrical power, deionized water, and dry salt with no liquid waste - Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD).

That's because winds have pushed the wildfire smoke from Quebec and northeastern Ontario to southern Ontario and the GTA. <br/><br/> Earlier in the week, Toronto saw northwesterly winds, bringing in smoke from fires burning in northern Ontario, explained Phillips. <br/><br/> But later in the week, \"we're going to see the winds shift more to the east and that's a concern because it's going to take the smoke from the Quebec fires, which are much more prevalent right now, and move it through Eastern Ontario, and down through the GTA,\" he continued.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The Toronto Zoo is reducing its hours on Thursday, operating from 9:30 am to 3 pm.

That's because winds have pushed the wildfire smoke from Quebec and northeastern Ontario to southern Ontario and the GTA. <br/><br/> Earlier in the week, Toronto saw northwesterly winds, bringing in smoke from fires burning in northern Ontario, explained Phillips. <br/><br/> But later in the week, \"we're going to see the winds shift more to the east and that's a concern because it's going to take the smoke from the Quebec fires, which are much more prevalent right now, and move it through Eastern Ontario, and down through the GTA,\" he continued.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The Toronto Zoo is reducing its hours on Thursday, operating from 9:30 am to 3 pm.

That's because winds have pushed the wildfire smoke from Quebec and northeastern Ontario to southern Ontario and the GTA. <br/><br/> Earlier in the week, Toronto saw northwesterly winds, bringing in smoke from fires burning in northern Ontario, explained Phillips. <br/><br/> But later in the week, \"we're going to see the winds shift more to the east and that's a concern because it's going to take the smoke from the Quebec fires, which are much more prevalent right now, and move it through Eastern Ontario, and down through the GTA,\" he continued.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The Toronto Zoo is reducing its hours on Thursday, operating from 9:30 am to 3 pm.

These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>Wayne Long, Member of Parliament for Saint John Rothesay, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at the Saint John Airport.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide the airport with more than $1.8 million to purchase critical safety equipment including:</p><p> an aircraft rescue firefighting vehicle;a shelter to house and protect the firefighting vehicle;a snowblower to keep airside surfaces clear; anda runway surface friction tester.</p><p>This equipment will help maintain safe airport operations for aircraft, passengers, crews and airport workers.</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $500,000 in Airports Capital Assistance Program funding provided to the airport in May 2021, to support the rehabilitation of airside apron floodlighting and electrical constant current regulators.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and smaller National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles, and installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The Saint John Airport is an important hub for residents and businesses in this region. This investment will help maintain continued safe and reliable airport operations for folks in Southern New Brunswick, many of whom depend on their local airport not only for personal and business travel, but also for access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. Investing in smaller, regional airports like YSJ means that Saint John will continue to have access to major hubs for years to come.\"</p><p>Wayne LongMember of Parliament for Saint John Rothesay</p><p>\"The pandemic highlighted the important role Canada's local and regional airports play in our country's economy, and in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities. In addition to supporting personal travel, local and regional airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our commitment to build safer, healthier and stronger communities as Canada recovers from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar AlghabraMinister of Transport</p><p>Quick Facts</p><p> an aircraft rescue firefighting vehicle;a shelter to house and protect the firefighting vehicle;a snowblower to keep airside surfaces clear; anda runway surface friction tester.</p><p>Associated Link</p><p> an aircraft rescue firefighting vehicle;a shelter to house and protect the firefighting vehicle;a snowblower to keep airside surfaces clear; anda runway surface friction tester.</p><p>Transport Canada is online at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tc.gc.ca\">www.tc.gc.ca</url>.

The caller said that the giant cedar on First Street near Jubilee was going to be cut down as the developer's arborist claims it's hollow inside. The new tree bylaw allows for large trees to be removed if they are considered hazardous.</p><p>If in fact it is actually hollow, I don't believe that necessarily constitutes a danger. The lifeblood of a tree flows through the cambium which is in the outside layer just inside the bark.</p><p>Bamboo,which can be stronger than steel, is hollow. In many parts of the world bamboo is used for scaffolding for tall building construction. One of the largest trees in Western Australia is the red tingle. The inside of these trees is more flammable than the outside and after a forest fire all that often remains is the shell of the trunk plus the canopy. I went inside one that resembled a cathedral with a black, vaulted ceiling. They continue to thrive for decades.</p><p>The cedar on First has already been topped so there is no chance of it blowing over. It will just require selective pruning periodically to manage the weight on the lateral limbs.</p><p>Before developers start to build they like a clean slate. All vegetation and soil are removed. When the building nears completion, if you are curious as to where the gardens will go, just watch where all the construction rubble gets dumped. That will be the garden. I've observed this numerous times and once again after the condo was built on Second Street a few years ago. The landscaper was planting maple trees directly on top of chunks of asphalt and concrete in about 10 inches of soil. After taking photos I questioned whether he felt those trees would prosper. He seemed perplexed and insulted that I would question his planting technique. He thought briefly, smiled and then cordially replied. \"Don't worry sir, I'm only planting trees with short roots.\" According to Peter Dinter, on his CBC gardening program, the average lifespan for newly planted trees in harsh urban environments is eight years.</p><p>The elderly are very vulnerable in our culture. Be it trees, buildings or people. The future of this magnificent arboreal giant should be respectfully safeguarded. Alas, I fear that it will be gone by the time I return to Duncan. I already feel sadness and shame.</p><p>Alan Shivas</p><p>Duncan</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-4250714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6477-BGJ1-JDH1-C4FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 All material copyright Black Press Inc. or it's licensors.

The caller said that the giant cedar on First Street near Jubilee was going to be cut down as the developer's arborist claims it's hollow inside. The new tree bylaw allows for large trees to be removed if they are considered hazardous.</p><p>If in fact it is actually hollow, I don't believe that necessarily constitutes a danger. The lifeblood of a tree flows through the cambium which is in the outside layer just inside the bark.</p><p>Bamboo,which can be stronger than steel, is hollow. In many parts of the world bamboo is used for scaffolding for tall building construction. One of the largest trees in Western Australia is the red tingle. The inside of these trees is more flammable than the outside and after a forest fire all that often remains is the shell of the trunk plus the canopy. I went inside one that resembled a cathedral with a black, vaulted ceiling. They continue to thrive for decades.</p><p>The cedar on First has already been topped so there is no chance of it blowing over. It will just require selective pruning periodically to manage the weight on the lateral limbs.</p><p>Before developers start to build they like a clean slate. All vegetation and soil are removed. When the building nears completion, if you are curious as to where the gardens will go, just watch where all the construction rubble gets dumped. That will be the garden. I've observed this numerous times and once again after the condo was built on Second Street a few years ago. The landscaper was planting maple trees directly on top of chunks of asphalt and concrete in about 10 inches of soil. After taking photos I questioned whether he felt those trees would prosper. He seemed perplexed and insulted that I would question his planting technique. He thought briefly, smiled and then cordially replied. \"Don't worry sir, I'm only planting trees with short roots.\" According to Peter Dinter, on his CBC gardening program, the average lifespan for newly planted trees in harsh urban environments is eight years.</p><p>The elderly are very vulnerable in our culture. Be it trees, buildings or people. The future of this magnificent arboreal giant should be respectfully safeguarded. Alas, I fear that it will be gone by the time I return to Duncan. I already feel sadness and shame.</p><p>Alan Shivas</p><p>Duncan</p><p>Copyright 2021 Cowichan Valley Citizen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20211203ICZ4250714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6474-NWP1-F0HF-8121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

It is free to attend, but advanced registration is required via Eventbrite.</p><p>Further details are available at TourismMission.ca. Proof of vaccination is required.</p><p>Chris Gruenwald, Mission's director of forestry, thanks Rhodes for her work, former director Bob O'Neal for his effort to get the project started, as well as the Kwantlen, Leq'a:mel, and Matsqui Nations for their meaningful contributions.</p><p>\"We are pleased to share this book with our community,\" Gruenwald said. \"It not only tells the story of Mission as a trailblazer in terms of community forestry in Canada, but it also details the cultural and spiritual importance of the area to local First Nation Communities.\"</p><p>The book retails for $35.99 and will be available for purchase at Friday's event and the Mission Visitor Centre, City Hall, via Amazon.ca and chapters.indigo.ca</p><p>Copyright 2021 Mission City Record</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MISREC-news20210920PMI4215650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MISREC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63N8-MCD1-JD2C-J407-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438231</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"364\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Education and awareness campaigns may be effective in reducing the discharge of fireworks. Such campaigns could emphasize the associated risks to livestock and domestic animals, noise pollution, environmental concerns and forest fire risk.\"</p><p>MacDonald said the board may explore a range of regulatory changes to the fireworks bylaw; which include requiring permit holders to attain a fireworks operator certificate, and identifying specific geographic locations in the region where fireworks discharge is acceptable, and this may or may not be limited to specific dates.</p><p>He said the board may also consider increasing the minimum distance to livestock or to active farms (the minimum distance is currently 500 metres), and removing the option to discharge of fireworks on July 1, or more generally, during the summer months when there is a heightened fire risk.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.com\">robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Copyright 2022 Cowichan Valley Citizen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COWCIT-news20220413ICZ4307522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COWCIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6570-N9M1-F0HF-821W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

'I don't want to leave, my whole life is here.' <br/><br/> A Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter drops water onto a forest fire near Agios Stefanos, north of Athens. \u2014  AFP<br/> Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution and a migrant camp was evacuated. <br/> Hundreds of miles southwest in the Peleponnese region roughly 5,000 tourists and residents were forced to flee another fire. <br/> Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said that out of 99 fires reported on Thursday, 56 were still active. <br/> At least 450 Greek firefighters have been pressed into service along with water-dropping air support and reinforcements from France, Switzerland, Romania, Sweden, Israel and Cyprus. <br/> - 'Treachery' - <br/> More people were forced from their homes on Friday in five Turkish provinces, including tourist hotspots Antalya and Mugla, according to NTV. <br/> President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has faced huge criticism for failing to accept some offers of foreign help after revealing that Turkey had no functioning firefighting planes. <br/><br/> Techniques for fighting wildfires. \u2014  AFP<br/> The Turkish government is also facing pressure after the opposition claimed a report by a government agency showed only a fraction of the budget for forest fire prevention had been spent. <br/> 'This is a situation that one could go as far as to describe as treachery,' opposition party MP Murat Emir told AFP. <br/> Extreme fires like those in Greece and Turkey will become even worse, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a draft report due out next year seen by AFP. <br/> 'Climate change is forcing Mediterranean landscapes into a flammable state more regularly by drying out vegetation and priming it to burn,' said Matthew Jones, research fellow at the University of East Anglia's Tyndall Centre for ClimateChange Research. <br/> burs-chv/lc/jxb <br/><url

It even advertises itself as such in its snowbird-beckoning brochures. It's probably nice to stroll on a beach and watch the sun splash down in the Gulf of Mexico, because with it comes the coolness of the evening and the night. </p><p>The reverse is probably true on the Atlantic side of Florida, but sunrises aren't mentioned in the brochures. We don't have those dramatic beginnings or fiery endings to our days up here in Canada, probably because we don't have the same humidity and particulate content in the atmosphere. Not unless there's been a recent forest fire, or smog. Nope. What we're blessed with, are much slower transitions from daylight to darkness, and from night to day. Blessed, because they give us time to wake up slowly in the morning and time to organize and do things in the twilight of the late afternoon and evenings. In the summer there's time for kids to stretch out their games for one or two more innings, or a couple more rounds of hide and seek. And, there's time to wander a trail for miles in the gradually lengthening shadows of a late afternoon in winter, or on a summer's evening, or maybe organize a campfire. It's different in the tropical south. There, the morning sun seems to jump straight up, is blazing straight overhead at high noon, and falls straight down at the end of the day. There's not much time between sunrise and the time of looking for shady spots in which to avoid its heat. It may explain why people in tropical climates generally get up early and get to where they need to be while it's still cool. It's all a matter of physics, planetary motion, and where we choose to live. Up here, in the wintertime, it's a land of long shadows because the sun doesn't get too high and never feels too hot. Here, brilliant, colourful sunsets can last for as long as is necessary to take the dog for its walk, or maybe to trot home and get the camera for a shot of the sunset from up on Lookout Hill. (There's one in every town, isn't there?) Then, on winter nights with a clear sky, a full moon, and a fresh layer of snow from a day or so before ... Well, we could say more, but then 'flamingos' might hear of it and want to flock up here. Sunrise and sunset were simply the start and end of the day in ancient times. Only in the music of the Psalms does it become lyrical. \"Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.\" (Psalm 65:8 RSV). Rev.

An update on the consultations will be expected in the first three months of 2022.</p><p>The block was closed for 63 days \u2013 July 1 to Sept. 7, 2021 \u2013 as a pilot project initiated by council to enhance the downtown experience by creating a temporary, vibrant, usable and welcoming public space for area businesses to utilize and community members to use.</p><p>The closure was coordinated by several city departments in collaboration with the DVA.</p><p>Management of the space, which included daily cleaning and hiring and scheduling musical entertainment, fell to the DVA.</p><p>\u201cAs a pilot project, this year\u2019s closure faced extraordinary challenges that made it difficult to properly gauge the benefits of the closure,\u201d city economic development and tourism manager John Perrott said in a report to council.</p><p>The challenges included short notice for businesses and the DVA of the closure which limited the opportunity for planning and ordering supplies to create an outdoor space for their clients, the record-setting high temperatures during the \u2018heat dome\u2019 at the start of the project, poor air quality due to forest fire activity in the region for most of the summer, limited availability of staff for restaurants and evolving COVID-19 public health guidelines.</p><p>Perrott said many businesses were generally positive about the block closure, but felt the short notice, combined with the heat and smoky skies, provided limited chances to utilize the closure for their businesses.</p><p>Coun. Kari Gares said it\u2019s imperative the city hold more consultation and do it sooner than later.</p><p>\u201cI am optimistic if we do this early enough that the outcome might be different, especially with the businesses wanting to be more of a participant as opposed to doing a petition saying \u2018no, no, no,\u2019\u201d said Gares.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful from that \u2018perfect storm\u2019 we experienced, we\u2019ve learned some lessons on that and I think that\u2019s going to help us manoeuvre the potential closure for next year a little bit better.\u201d</p><p>The DVA staff completed a survey and post-closure report for its board of directors but the results were not yet available to the city at the time of Perrott\u2019s report.</p><p>Morning Star Staff</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERNON-news20211125PQYA0002257685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERNON2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:645D-YR21-F0HF-846Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"426\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, May 9, 17 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

It was the first time the volcano had erupted in more than 6,000 years. Fagradalsfjall, 50 kilometres from the capital in Reykjavik, is a relatively accessible volcano. Sitting in a wide plain at the bottom of a valley, it is not so much a mountain as a decent-sized hill surrounded by cracks in the earth that vent gases and sometimes lava. Despite the obvious dangers of liquid rock and noxious fumes, visiticeland.com dubbed the event a \"tourist eruption\" - photogenic but easy to get to, with little imminent danger. Crowds of Icelanders trekked out to witness the lava flows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Icelandic artist J\u00f3nsi was not among them. Stranded in Los Angeles, unable to travel because of the pandemic, he was left to imagine what he was missing. What did it sound like? What did it smell like? What did it feel like to watch the volcano wake up after millennia asleep? The AGO's recent acquisition of his sound installation \"Hrafntinna (Obsidian),\" on display at the gallery, attempts to do just that.</p><p>A piney, burnt-rock smell wafts out of the gallery, where an array of 195 speakers surrounds a platform that reverberates with bass notes from the subwoofers concealed within. A light overhead takes that platform from dark to dim.</p><p>It is very much like sitting in a cave on the kind of day where clouds whip across the sky. The sounds from the speakers crackle; the artist's voice whispers and pops; at one point he sings what sounds like a single word, over and oversings what sounds like the name of the volcano, over and over, using big, round churchy tones that wrap around you. The viewer is meant to settle into the work rather than simply stroll by. The audio loop is 25 minutes and 33 seconds long, but it's easy to lose track of time. There's no heat in this volcano, but the scent and sounds make it feel warm. The overall effect is like cuddling up to the Earth itself - a disorienting experience, but not a scary one.</p><p>If your sense of volcanoes comes mostly through pop culture, the intimacy of \"Hrafntinna\" comes as a bit of a shock. In Hollywood depictions, mountains ejecting lava serve largely as backdrops for human endeavour, drama and folly. \"Volcano,\" the 1997 movie starring Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche, had its heroes using a condo building to stop a lava flow from melting L.A. In \"Dante's Peak,\" also released in 1997, a volcanologist played by Pierce Brosnan and a small-town mayor played by Linda Hamilton team up to save a town from an eruption modelled on that of Mount St. Helens.</p><p>This emphasis on destruction is not unfounded. In 1985, the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia killed 20,000 people when the mudflow, or lahar, it caused engulfed the town of Armero. Recent advances in monitoring and early warning systems have made timely evacuations more likely - but getting people out of the way is about all that we can do.</p><p>Yet to see volcanoes as B-movie monsters is to ignore the character of the Earth itself. It was volcanoes that built the early atmosphere, volcanoes that made the oceans. Volcanoes continue to remake the planet daily. Magma hardens into rock; ash weathers into soil.</p><p>There is a deep, romantic appeal to all this geologic transformation. In a BBC news video from August, a woman confessed to having a little cry beside another Iceland volcano eruption. She had always dreamed of seeing lava, and now here it was. Drone footage of Fagradalsfjall in 2021 shows rivers of red flowing over the rocky landscape. It's nighttime and the only colour is magma.</p><p>Volcano videos are popular on YouTube - one National Geographic volcanoes compilation appears to have almost as many views as some Shawn Mendes videos. It is as if what we long for is a version of the Earth scorched into newness, erasing everything, even ourselves.</p><p>As the consequences of climate change loom near enough to see, it is arguably comforting to think that humans are not the only agents of destruction in the neighbourhood, and also that that destruction has been happening forever. In January, the popular podcast \"Radiolab\"made the case that the worst year ever was not 2020 or 2021 but 536 CE. That year, a massive volcanic eruption in Iceland plunged the Northern Hemisphere into a cascade of disasters. Crops failed, people starved. The sun went out, and birds fell from the sky. See, the volcanoes tell us, we break things too sometimes. Just because everything's dying doesn't mean it's the end of the world.</p><p>I've never been up close to a volcano, but the smell of \"Hrafntinna\" was familiar: Woodsmoke with a mineral edge (the gallery's notes call it fossilized amber). It reminded me of what it's like to be downwind from a forest fire. I breathed it in and out, listening to the crackle of the speakers.</p><p>At the AGO, \"Hrafntinna\"rumbled, and a group of middle-school students on a field trip erupted in giggles, getting more of a kick out of the piece than the few adults on a sunny September morning. It was comforting, inside this imagined volcano. The recorded voice started to rise again; it sounded plaintive.</p><p>Since the 19th century, archeologists have made chalk and plaster casts of the victims of Mount Vesuvius - people and animals frozen where they died. You can tell which ones were caught in the volcano's thermal surge because their toes are curled in agony. It is perhaps wiser to aspire to be smaller than volcanoes than to try and outdo them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20221015TTA2022101565870749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66MB-Y7D1-JDV5-F1XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
