Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of Thursday, Oct. 20, 21 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timeline</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.</p><p>As of July 8, 2022 15 speed cameras of 22 were activated.</p><p>Tickets</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>Where are the cameras?</p><p>Active Speed Cameras</p><p>Clara Drive, between Nethwerwood Road and Catalpa Road in Ward 5.

She was 96.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jean was a lovely person who always thought of others before herself. She loved travel, flowers, and going for walks, which earned her the title, Walking Gramma. She loved reading, and for many years she read the Penticton Herald cover to cover every day; no crossword puzzle could defeat her. She loved good food, which she could remember in alarming detail years later. She had a quiet, somehow birdlike zest for life, with a remarkable ability to find even small, simple things interesting. This made her a wonderful travel companion. She treasured the belief that people are generally good-hearted, and she took real pleasure in noting their good deeds and acts of kindness towards one another. Nervous by nature, Jean was shy, yet not retiring, unassumingly embracing life\u2019s opportunities to step up and do things with and for others. She believed passionately in women\u2019s equality. Otherwise, she was adamant about few things; but one of them was that, over her, a fuss should never be made. Sorry Jean, but you were too deeply loved, and will be too sorely missed, not to receive at least a little fuss.</p><p>Jean was born in 1924 in Penticton, where she lived her entire life. Her mother was a lovely woman, and despite losing her father at an early age and being a child of the Great Depression, Jean had a happy childhood with her two sisters and many friends. They had much fun in and around Penticton, including making a bonfire and skating on frozen Okanagan Lake, and hitching rides on the train as it debarked the rail barge on the lake shore. By their own admission, \u201cthe Heal girls\u201d were known to be a bit mischievous, but it must have all been good natured, judging by how caringly the trio were watched over by members of the town.</p><p>In the 1940\u2019s, Jean worked as a teller at the Royal Bank. She made good friends and was happy there, although being left on her own with a loaded gun to do the final tally and deposit did make her nervous. In 1947, Jean married Dick Gibbs, and they built a house and planted a cherry orchard on the West Bench. They adopted a newborn baby in 1959 and another in 1962\u2014two extremely fortunate boys\u2014and raised their family happily together until the tragic, sudden death of Dick in 1978. After the loss of her beloved husband, Jean and her younger son moved into an apartment in town, and she returned to full-time employment, working at the tax office until her retirement in 1988. Jean lived in her Calgary Avenue apartment until 2017, when she moved into Charles Manor Retirement Residence, and then into Westview Place in 2020.</p><p>Being of service to the community was important to Jean, and she volunteered her time and energy helping with various Penticton activities and events. She served as a leader for the Girl Guides, and later, when her boys reached the right age, for the Cub Scouts pack on the West Bench. Through her decades-long membership in the Business and Professional Women\u2019s Club, she was a regular volunteer at the Penticton Square Dance Jamborees and helped with the city\u2019s forest fire relief efforts. Jean often provided for bake sales, such as those held by the local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion, where she was a long-time member. She also baked diligently for events at her church, St. Saviour\u2019s Anglican, where she was a devoted parishioner. For many years she was a member of the church\u2019s altar guild, and it was a common sight at Jean\u2019s apartment to see freshly cleaned and ironed altar cloths and purificators draped carefully over the furniture. Perhaps this can somehow account for the seeming miracle Jean worked in using a strictly limited income to fund regular donations to a multitude of charities. Though forever richer for having included her, many lives will be poorer with Jean\u2019s passing. Her absence will of course be felt most acutely by her family, whom she loved, and with whom she shared many laughter-filled holidays, happy dinners, and boisterous card games.</p><p>Beloved mother, grandmother, sister, and aunt, Jean is survived by her sons and daughters-in-law, Brian Gibbs and Meg Streiff, of Melbourne, Australia, and Martin and Kim Gibbs, of Naramata; grandchildren, Brandon Gibbs, of Grenaa, Denmark, and Nick Gibbs, of Calgary; sisters and brothers-in-law, Gladys and Al Cross, of Penticton, and Rheta and Ken Loader, of Hanover, and their children, Barb and Norm; niece and nephew-in-law, Linda and Rod Penfold, of Penticton, and their daughters, Marnie and Selena, and Selena\u2019s children, Hunter and Pollee; nephew and niecein-law, Allan and Debbie Cross, of Port Alberni, and their children, Darcy (and his sons, Drew and Sawyer), Travis (and his wife, Melissa, and their children, Nickolas, Nolan, and Daniela), and Ashley; and nephew-by-marriage, David Brooks, of Keremeos.</p><p>By now, Jean would be thinking, This is too long. Nobody wants to hear all this stuff about me. Get to the bit about the service.</p><p>A memorial service will be held at Saint Saviour\u2019s Anglican Church, in the Chapel, where Jean was christened and married, at some point in the future. It was Jean\u2019s wish that donations be made to the Penticton Hospital in lieu of flowers. The family are deeply grateful for the warmth and care Jean received from the staff and residents at Charles Manor and Westview Place, as was Jean herself.</p><p>It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Robert Hayhurst on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2020 at the age of 89 with family at his side. He is survived by Carol, his loving wife of 45 years, children; BarbaraAnn (Randy), Terry (Kim), Shannon (Keith), and Jennifer (Rick); brotherinlaw Don (Pat) and family as well as grandsons Trevor (Saebom), Derek (Gina) and their dad Arthur; Brycen (Jaclyn), granddaughter Nicole (Anna); extended family Trevor (Maxime), Connor (William), Danielle (Dayo) and three beautiful little greatgranddaughters, Emma, Raven and Talyn. A lifelong member of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, he will be remembered by Robert Hayhurst 1931 ~ 2020 his loving church family.</p><p>Bob was a true Pentictonite, born in the old Penticton Hospital (now Haven Hill) and living his entire life in Penticton. He graduated from Pen Hi and spent his entire working career at the Penticton Law Courts, retiring from the court Registry after 35 years of service. After retirement Bob and Carol spent many happy years travelling around the world, including Ikeda, Japan where they taught. They learned so much about the culture and fell in love with the people, resulting in lifelong friendships. We would like to give our heartfelt thanks to Dr. Westby and the caring nurses and staff at Westview Place who made Bob\u2019s final days very peaceful. A special thank you to Reverend Colin Cross whose care and support of Bob and his family was and is appreciated.</p><p>As the pandemic does not permit gatherings at this time, funeral services and a celebration of life will be held at a later date.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, for those who wish, donations may be made to St. Andrew Presbyterian Church in Penticton in Bob\u2019s memory.</p><p>To leave condolances for the family please visit providencefuneralhomes.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENNWS-news20210113PRRA0001535674</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VW-TS71-F0HF-80K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438267</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1204\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

While Prince Rupert saw air service return in late June, there are many community airports that have had no service at all.</p><p>\"They have gone for an extended period of time without any revenue,\" he said.</p><p>According to the RCAC all airports have been hit with severe reductions in revenues and reduced or canceled air service leaving them unable to meet the costs of operating the airports unless governments step in with direct financial support soon.</p><p>\"For airports, you get paid per seat. So a customer buys an airline ticket, the airport that they fly into gets a piece of whatever the rate was. So for all of the cancelled flights and empty seats that is just revenue that can never be recouped,\" Leach said.</p><p>Despite a dramatic decline in airline passenger traffic since the COVID pandemic began in March, Canada's smaller airports have carried the financial burden of maintaining their runways, air terminals, and emergency services without access to any previous or current financial aid, RCAC said in the release.</p><p>Leach said even when there were no flights coming in and out, the airport still has bills and expenses to pay. To assist the Prince Rupert Regional Airport he has just negotiated new terms of a Legacy Loan that the City provided several years ago to cover the redevelopment of the airport.</p><p>\"If Prince Rupert goes back to pre-COVID levels and those levels of passenger ridership come back, we will be fine. We will have lost money, but we had a bit of a good balance to be able to drive through. With assistance from the city deferring some of the loan &amp;#x26;#8230; it will help us get through. But, that said, we don't know when this is going to end.\"</p><p>\"When governments and the public hear of dire situations in the aviation sector the focus tends to be on the major airlines and the major airports that connect Canadians in large urban areas to transborder and international destinations, and that is frustrating to the Regional Community Airports of Canada.\"</p><p>Businesses like airlines can be creative Leach said, and find ways to increase costs to recoup lost revenue, like increasing ticket prices, lounge costs, or by giving fewer upgrades. But for community airports, like Prince Rupert it is a different scenario.</p><p>\"I would just be cutting my own throat and putting our airport out of business,\" Leach said. \"I'm at a level where I can't request too much more (from customers). Our costs (expenditures) are as low as I can get. I have a very small workforce, we really can't do with any less people. And after that, it's you know, my utility bills, so I gotta keep the lights on,\" Leach said.</p><p>Brian Grant, Chair of the RCAC said smaller airports play a critical role in providing remote access and a quality of life that all Canadians expect.</p><p>\"Movement of critical food supplies, emergency health care, essential cargo, emergency evacuation, forest fire fighting services are just a few examples of what regional and community airports deliver in addition to passenger air travel\".</p><p>\"2020 has been a year of deep staffing cuts and reducing services, under the pressure of exceptional revenue loses, to meet fixed operational and safety costs dictated by government regulation along with new pandemic related costs to ensure the safety and confidence of travellers,\" Grant said. \"In 2021 these airports are estimating upwards of 45-60 per cent increases in rates and fees charged to airlines and passengers to continue operations as they exist today. In most cases reserve funds have been depleted and the only possible reductions left are closures of airport infrastructure\".</p><p>Apart from a government cash infusion to assist the struggling small airports recommendations from the national organization include:</p><p>\"Ensure regional and community airports' eligibility to all federal COVID assistance programs (i.e. emergency wage subsidy, debit relief and loans programs, and rent subsidy etc.) regardless of governance or ownership model.</p><p>Stabilize the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy for airports to not less than 75 per cent for 2021 to protect the employment capabilities of these airports for employees.</p><p>Provide financial assistance to cover fixed operating costs at 2019 levels to eliminate deficits and avoid rates and fees increases in order to bolster airline and travel activity.</p><p>Increase Airport Capital Assistance Program funding to $95 million annually (an industry request prior to the COVID-19 pandemic dating back more than two years).</p><p>Adjust the federal contribution limit to the ACAP to not less than 75 per cent of eligible project costs and relax the eligibility requirement of commercial schedule passenger service for current eligible airports for 2021 through 2025, to ensure the protection and maintenance of essential infrastructure and equipment during the post-pandemic recovery period.</p><p>The Regional Community Airports of Canada is a national organization dedicated to promoting the viability of regional and community airports within the air transportation system in Canada consisting of 59 members representing over 190 airports nationwide.\"</p><p>K-J Millar | Journalist</p><p>Send K-J email</p><p>Like the The Northern View on Facebook</p><p>Follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NORTHV-4069877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NORTHV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6164-VP61-JDH1-C28Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438217</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Northern View (Prince Rupert)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 30, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

In the Russian community of Verkhoyansk, temperatures topped 38C, marking what may be the highest air temperature ever recorded within the Arctic.</p><p>The temperatures at Verkhoyansk are part of a larger trend across western Russia this summer, with small communities throughout the region reporting temperatures that are smashing local records that have stood for decades. During the latter half of June, surface temperatures throughout western Siberia were as much as 10C above historical norms, marking one of the hottest Junes on record despite relatively cool temperatures at the start of the month.</p><p>For scientists the world-over these record-breaking temperatures are alarm bells, demonstrating the kind of extreme weather events we can expect to see more often if climate change continues unchecked. However, it is the long-term fallout from modern heat waves that has many northern scientists deeply concerned, as they will affect our planet for decades to come.</p><p>The fires that follow</p><p>During heat waves surface temperatures soar, often triggering a chain of fire-promoting weather conditions including extreme thunderstorms. These thunderstorms have hundreds of lightning strikes that can ignite the dry soils and vegetation that serve as fuel for fire.</p><p>In northern regions like the boreal biome, these fire-promoting conditions can cause large-scale wildfires that burn millions of hectares of forest in a single summer.</p><p>Historically, humanity has considered wildfire a true disaster and spent considerable resources to suppress them. We now understand that despite the initial loss of established trees and soils, wildfires are a natural and integral part of the boreal biome.</p><p>Modern wildfires, however, are occurring with increasing frequency and intensity, covering a larger area due weather events like severe heat waves. In extreme fire years, these modern wildfires can burn deep into the organic soils that characterize boreal forests. These carbon-rich soils have been built up over thousands of years and hold approximately 30 per cent of the world's terrestrial carbon stocks.</p><p>When fires burn deep into soils or return too quickly to a forest, they lose their \"ancient carbon\" stocks. Instead of being held in the ground these ancient carbon reserves are combusted and released back into the atmosphere, increasing the carbon levels. The higher carbon dioxide levels generated by wildfires intensify climate change impacts like heat waves, which can lead to further wildfires, forming a powerful \"positive feedback\" loop with climate change.</p><p>While these trends alone are alarming, northern researchers warn that the fallout from heat waves won't stop when the fires burn out. In northern regions where the soils historically stay frozen year-round, a whole new set of changes are beginning to take form.</p><p>When permafrost perishes</p><p>Permafrost forms on the landscape when soil materials remain below freezing for two or more consecutive years. In some areas permafrost forms in direct response to a cold climate.</p><p>As one moves further south, however, permafrost becomes increasingly dependent on the presence of thick organic soils, surface vegetation and a shady overstorey to survive the warm summer months. In those cases, the ecosystem acts like a giant protective blanket, limiting the sun's heat that is able to reach the frozen permafrost materials below.</p><p>When permafrost ecosystems burn, the wildfire consumes these protective layers, often triggering permafrost thaw. This can occur gradually, with the thawed layer expanding slowly over decades, or abruptly, with the thawed layer expanding dramatically over years. The land may cave in or sink, plant communities may change completely and local water flows may be rerouted.</p><p>In both cases, the loss of permafrost makes the massive Arctic carbon reserves more vulnerable to loss. With gradual thaw microbes are able to break down and release the previously frozen carbon back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In contrast, abrupt thaw commonly occurs in ice-rich permafrost resulting in warmer but also wetter soils. Under these conditions decomposition still occurs but carbon is commonly returned to the atmosphere as methane, a greenhouse gas approximately 30 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.</p><p>All this lost carbon may make the positive feedback with climate change even stronger. While scientists are working to understand if the vegetation that grows after permafrost thaw is able to offset all the carbon released during decomposition, most current models indicate that permafrost thaw will ultimately be a source of atmospheric carbon.</p><p>Researchers are coming to understand just how tightly linked these disturbances caused by climate change really are. What appears as an individual event - heat wave, forest fire or permafrost thaw - has cascading ramifications through time and space in the Arctic, potentially serving as the seed crystal for the next disturbance in the coming months, years or even decades that follow.</p><p>Heat waves, wildfires and permafrost thaw represent an environmental trifecta that are inherently linked and drive change in the occurrence and intensity of one another.</p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

I immediately fell in love with life in the Kootenays. I met my wife here and we have 3 young kids ages 4, 6, and 8.</p><p>I enjoy biking, weight lifting, and spending time with my family. Four years ago we made the decision to sell my truck and buy an e-bike, making us a one car family. Now I do most of my trips around town by bike, I am a member of the West Kootenay Cycling Coalition, and I just ran the GoByBike week event (formerly known as bike to work week) for the Trail area.</p><p>I am passionate about improving active transportation infrastructure in our cities so that more people can feel comfortable leaving the car at home and taking trips with greener forms of transportation.</p><p>Katrine Conroy &amp; - BC NDP</p><p>Katrine Conroy has represented the West Kootenays as MLA since 2005. Since 2017 she has been British Columbia's Minister of Children and Family Development, as well as Minister Responsible for the Columbia Basin Trust, Columbia Power Corporation and the Columbia River Treaty.</p><p>While in opposition Katrine was the caucus whip in addition to being spokesperson for Seniors, Interior Economic Development, Labour, Columbia Power Corporation, Columbia Basin Trust and the Columbia River Treaty.</p><p>Katrine had a varied career before becoming an MLA. She was one of B.C.'s first female power engineers, and has worked as an early childhood educator, executive director of a multi-service non-profit agency, a college instructor, and a small business person.</p><p>Together with her husband Ed, Katrine raised 4 children and has 9 grandchildren and for 42 years has lived on their ranch in Pass Creek.</p><p>Andrew Duncan &amp; - BC Green</p><p>In a world where you can be anything, be kind. It may sound clich&amp;#x26;#233; and naive, however, to a dyslexic boy who was told he would not finish high school, it seems like a great place to start.</p><p>I read Rupi Kaur and Lenard Cohen poetry in the mountains; I am as comfortable behind a chainsaw and throwing avalanche explosives as I am reading academic papers. I have a passion to learn and to strive to do better for myself, for my children, and my community.</p><p>Ten years ago I joined search and rescue (SAR) to help others, I am currently Rossland SAR manager and spent several years as president of Rossland SAR. I want to lead by example for my children, so that they know we can always try to do better, try to help others and try to improve our communities.</p><p>My education is a BSc in Environmental Science and Physical Geography. However, science does not hold all the answers and so my MA is in Environmental Education and Communication, where I focused on my community &amp; - North Rockies snowmobilers and avalanche literacy.</p><p>Corbin Kelley &amp; - BC Liberal</p><p>While I may only be 19 years old, I am still passionate about politics and especially the future of our beautiful province.</p><p>Born in Kamloops and growing up in Vernon I have deep roots in the interior, and I fondly remember coming to the Kootenays for summer holidays. I am now studying political science and economics at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops. One thing politics has taught me is you should always be open to learning and understand that no one is right 100 per cent of the time.</p><p>Though I wish I lived in one of the many beautiful communities in our riding, I do not. However, I believe that makes me an even better listener as I do not come here with my own biases. I am excited to meet the people of Kootenay West.</p><p>Fletcher Quince &amp; - Independent</p><p>In 2009 I moved to Rossland to reintegrate Francis Rattenbury's historic Bank of Montreal Building into the community's cultural and economic landscape. In addition to rejuvenating the building, which now houses 15 local businesses, I curate a marketplace for Kootenay Creative Products, known as the Quoynary Canada.</p><p>Throughout my decade living in the region I have served Kootenay West residents in a variety of roles, including as the Vice President of the Greater Trail Community Skills Centre, as a member of the Columbia Basin Trust's Our Trust, Our Future Residents Working Group in 2015, as Chair of the City of Rossland's Fire and Emergency Services Review Task Force in 2016, and as an executive member of the Lower Columbia Community Development Team Society until 2017.</p><p>Prior to moving to the West Kootenay's I worked as a wildland firefighter, research scientist and incident commander with Alberta's Sustainable Resource Development Branch. During which time I completed an undergraduate in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Alberta in 2005, and a masters degree in Forest Fire Management Systems from the University of Toronto in 2009.</p><p>The opportunity to provide conscious, and available, representation for Kootenay West residents is at the core of my interest in pursuing election at this time.</p><p>Ed Varney &amp; - Independent</p><p>I was born in Nelson. I spent the first two years of my life in the Valley at my family's farm at the south end of the Little Slocan Lakes, then we moved to Vallican, also in the Little Slocan.</p><p>I have completed five years of post-secondary education finishing at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto in 1976 with the gold medal for technology in mechanical engineering. I followed up by obtaining certification as millwright, heavy duty mechanic and welding.</p><p>I have worked in B.C. from the west coast of Vancouver Island, east and south to Sparwood and Elkford, and north to Fort Nelson and Smithers. I worked for a short time in Alberta's forest and gas industry and very briefly in Montreal. I have had many jobs from teaching school (Mechanics 10) to falling timber. I've been back in the Slocan Valley since the summer of 1992. This broad spectrum of experience helps to better represent all citizens in Kootenay West.</p><p>I am a family man who, together with my wife, has raised four children and we now have nine grandchildren.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:betsy.kline@castlegarnews.comLike\">betsy.kline@castlegarnews.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CASNWS-4057133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CASNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610C-M1V1-F103-30HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Castlegar News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 24, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

An efficient crew, working with hand tools under ideal conditions, can get through a quarter of an acre a day, give or take.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And yet, after a succession of horrific, record-setting wildfire seasons, this is where the state now finds itself: So desperate to stem the tide and contain the losses \u2014 of lives and property \u2014 that it's plunking down more than $500 million this fiscal year alone for an effort that includes clearing pines, firs and redwoods. Without all this fuel on the forest floor, California officials contend, blazes will be less likely to turn into the mega-fires that devour thousands of acres. Dousing them once they erupt can't be the lone strategy in a state already scarred by global warming, they say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The question is whether this new push can be done at a pace and scale that'll actually make a difference.</p><p>In a best-case scenario, Governor Gavin Newsom hopes state and federal crews will be thinning out 1 million acres annually by 2025.</p><p>He's asking the state legislature to give him $2 billion to accelerate efforts in the fiscal year starting July 1. But even if his goal is achieved, it'd still leave millions of acres, and the communities that surround them, vulnerable for decades.</p><p>And with temperatures soaring and drought conditions worsening across the state, it's only a matter of time, scientists say, before the first of the big blazes of 2021 break out.</p><p>Although California's plan to thin woodland is a costly one, it's necessary to break the cycle of devastating blazes, according to Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University.Simply fighting fires as they start is \"a forever war,\" he said. \"You don't win those. The solution is to change your strategy and really rethink what you are doing.\"</p><p>It's an approach not dissimilar to the one then-President Donald Trump proposed in 2018, when he said California should follow Finland's lead and spend more time \"raking\" the forest floor to prevent blazes \u2014 a suggestion that promptly became fodder for memes and late-night television jokes. What Trump didn't mention is that the U.S. government owns about 58% of the state's land.</p><p>As part of the new plan, state and federal government are joining forces. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, is supplementing its own crews with outside organizations like the National Guard and the California Conservation Corps, a state department that puts young adults to work on environmental projects.</p><p>The push to thin California's forests is a race against time. Climate change has left the U.S. West hotter and drier, creating prime conditions for blazes.</p><p>Last year, wildfires in California killed 33 people and charred a record 4.3 million acres, an area larger than Connecticut.</p><p>Heading into peak fire season in the summer and fall, the entire state of California is gripped by drought conditions.</p><p>Fire season in the West is running about a month ahead of schedule, with conditions normally seen in July emerging now because of the drought, according to U.S. government forecasters.</p><p>Blazes will likely be more severe across the region this year, said Gina Palma, a fire meteorologist with the Department of Agriculture.</p><p>After years of mismanagement, many California forest lands are overcrowded stands of thirsty trees susceptible to insect infestation and disease. Suburban sprawl is reaching further into wooded areas in the most populous U.S. state, increasing the risk of wildfire fatalities. Last year, wildfires across California and the West cost the U.S. $16.5 billion, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information.</p><p>The task of forest-clearing is a perilous one, said Alex Makela, one of a dozen-member crew from the Conservation Corps. On a typical day, Makela and his fellow workers hike into a tangled thicket of branches, lugging everything they need \u2014 chainsaws, gasoline, food, rain gear and a medical kit \u2014 on their backs while they wipe sweaty brows and swat at mosquitoes.</p><p>Crew members must be vigilant to stay out of the path of falling trees. In some areas, with debris piled as high as four feet deep, wood chippers and controlled burns are required.\"</p><p>Lack of awareness is most dangerous,\" said Makela, who slipped and cracked a rib a few weeks back.</p><p>Because the goal of clearing 1 million acres is part of a joint project between California and the U.S. government, the state will only have to target 500,000 acres per year, said Christine McMorrow, a Cal Fire spokeswoman. Clearing done by private landowners, community groups and timber harvests may be counted toward that target, she said. The forest-management approach won't supplant the long-term strategy of attacking every fire over 10 acres in size.</p><p>While not all of California's 101 million acres are wildlands, state fire officials admit that meeting the million-acre-per-year goal will be a daunting, never-ending process.</p><p>\"As soon as you cut it down, it starts to regrow,\" said Steve Hawks, manager of the wildfire planning and engineering division at Cal Fire, which has firefighting responsibility for 31 million acres. \"It is going to be a constant thing.\"</p><p>Still, it's a good investment, according to Robert Bailey, direct of climate resilience at risk management and consulting firm Marsh McLennan. Governments fall into a \"firefighting trap,\" spending their money each year on putting out fires and leaving little for clearing deadwood and debris, Bailey said.</p><p>\"You get caught in this spiral of increasing costs and increasing fires,\" he said. \"The governments have to break out of this spiral by doing more preventative measures.\"</p><p>Views on forest management have shifted over time. In the U.S., forests were seen as a source of cheap building materials during the housing boom following World War II, then as a source of recreation in the decades that followed, leading to a strategy of aggressive firefighting.</p><p>Some environmental groups support forest clearing in certain areas, while others have expressed opposition. The Natural Conservancy in California \"has been and is very much involved in increasing efforts to reduce the risk of megafires through ecological thinning and controlled burns, particularly in the fire-adapted forests of the Sierra Nevada\" mountain range along the state's eastern edge, according to spokesman Juvenio Guerra.</p><p>But Bryant Baker, conservation director for Los Padres ForestWatch, said controlled burns in Southern California's national forests threaten native plant areas.</p><p>\"There are issues with just assuming this is some sort silver bullet in changing overall fires in the state,\" Baker said. \"Prescribed fire is not going to be the thing that stops very large wind-driven fires that are occurring.\"</p><p>A century-long ban on burning by Native American groups, some of which had a tradition of thinning forest, has made woodlands even more susceptible to uncontrolled fires, Amy Cordalis, general counsel for California's Yurok Tribe, said last month at a hearing before Congress.</p><p>\"We are facing an extremely elevated forest fire risk due to the drought and to the 100-year-long ban on cultural burning, which has lead to a massive buildup of exceedingly flammable fuels,\" Cordalis said. Other indigenous groups, however, have opposed government proposals to thin California forest land.</p><p>The human toll of wildfires has been vast, with the blazes killing more than 100 people in California over the past five years and upending the lives of millions more.</p><p>Residents of the state have endured blackouts as utilities periodically cut power in an attempt to prevent their equipment from sparking flames.</p><p>In 2019, San Francisco utility giant PG&amp;E Corp. was pushed into bankruptcy after it was found responsible for several large fires. Wildfires have also decimated air quality, spreading acrid, choking smoke throughout the state.</p><p>The fires are only getting worse.</p><p>Five of the state's largest-ever blazes seared California last year, and 10 of the most expensive have happened since 2003, according to Cal Fire. The price tag for fire suppression surpassed $100 million for the first time in the 1990s. In the 2020 to 2021 season, costs are estimated to have topped $1 billion for the first time, according to Cal Fire.</p><p>Although it's started off slowly so far, this fire season is expected to be an active one in the West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. More than 88% of an area that includes 11 western states is under drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p><p>\"The trend is pretty clear \u2014 the wildfire problem is not what it was 15 years ago,\" said Lou Gritzo, vice president and manager of research at commercial insurer FM Global. \"The fires are getting bigger.\"</p><p>\u2014 By Brian K Sullivan and Mark Chediak, Bloomberg News</p><p>RELATED: B.C. drone sighting halts helicopters fighting 250 hectares of wildfire</p><p>RELATED: BC Wildfire Service deploys 41 firefighters to Manitoba for assistance</p><p>Copyright 2021 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20210621PAB4174390</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62YW-8RD1-JD2C-J1KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Group Ltd.

The local vascular surgeon had tested positive for COVID-19, and after three days in the hospital his health was only getting worse. The oxygen level in his blood was low, a condition known as hypoxemia, and respiratory failure was a serious concern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the lungs go, oxygen can't be delivered to the rest of the body. Tissues will die and other will organs follow, like one domino knocking over another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But thanks to some quick thinking by his doctor and a yet-to-be-approved treatment that is showing potential to stave off the most detrimental effects of the coronavirus, Brown made a swift and dramatic turnaround.</p><p>\"Within two hours, I felt like a new person,\" said Brown, 57.</p><p>The physician who treated Brown is a close colleague, Dr. Drew Jones. Maybe it was providence that the man entrusted with Brown's well-being had spent years studying how the immune system reacts to disease in the lungs.</p><p>Jones, it turns out, was in the perfect position to save his colleague's life.</p><p>THE ILLNESS</p><p>On March 5, Brown flew to London to return his daughter to the U.S. from her semester abroad through New York University. He took precautions, wearing a mask on each flight and packing hand sanitizer in his bag.</p><p>He returned home the morning of Saturday, March 14, and when he entered the U.S. at the Detroit airport he wasn't required to undergo an enhanced screening.</p><p>Before returning to work at Bon Secours' Memorial Regional Medical Center in Hanover County, he spoke with the administration and others to explain where he had travelled and when he would return. Many other doctors who had travelled recently went through the same process, and Brown was cleared to return.</p><p>\"We take this thing very, very seriously,\" he said. \"It was a very fluid situation in mid-March.\"</p><p>Any Bon Secours associate who is potentially exposed to the coronavirus is evaluated and monitored by the hospital network and the Virginia Department of Health, Bon Secours spokeswoman Jenna Green said. One other associate who worked directly with Brown did test positive, he said, though it's nearly impossible to know where anyone got the virus.</p><p>He resumed work on Monday, March 16, and later that day the United Kingdom was added to a travel restriction list, which took effect at 11:59 p.m. that night. Among those restrictions: Any traveller returning from the U.K. would need to self-quarantine for 14 days. Having arrived just before the quarantine rule was enacted, Brown worked the entire week.</p><p>On Friday, March 20, Brown began feeling ill. He had typical flu symptoms - fever, shakes, aches and pains - so he stopped working, visited his hospital's emergency room and was tested for the coronavirus. He went home and awaited the results.</p><p>His entire practice was shut down for two weeks. All 11 employees in the Vascular Surgery Associates office in Hanover were sent home with pay. Each patient was contacted and monitored. Every inch of the office was thoroughly cleaned.</p><p>During the next week his condition didn't improve. His fever was unrelenting, his energy depleted. He couldn't eat. On March 24, he returned to the emergency room and was admitted to the hospital.</p><p>Visitors weren't allowed during his stay so he kept his wife updated through phone calls and FaceTime. He spent large portions of the day doing breathing exercises, and when medical staff members entered the room they spent minutes just donning personal protective equipment to safely treat him.</p><p>The standard treatments were administered, including Plaquenil and azithromycin. Plaquenil is a brand of hydroxychloroquine, a drug typically used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other illnesses that President Donald Trump has lauded. Azithromycin is a common respiratory medicine.</p><p>Despite the medicine he was given, Brown's condition didn't improve. Over the next four days his health deteriorated. Seven days after he was tested, results returned confirming what he already knew - he was positive for COVID-19.</p><p>THE TREATMENT</p><p>Jones, the pulmonologist who treated Brown, had already treated one COVID-19 patient. That man was 67 and had been in good health, yet the coronavirus had caused him to suffer cardiac arrest, liver failure and shock. He had been given the normal treatment and the virus had still ravaged his body. Earlier this month the man died.</p><p>Jones, 48, knew a change of direction was needed for other patients. He thought back to the years at the beginning of his career at VCU as a pulmonary and critical care fellow and faculty member. There he researched how the immune system functions in the lungs. He had watched how emphysema and asthma affected mice and rats. He knew that something needed to be done earlier in the sequence of infection to save the lives of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>There's a growing belief in the medical community that it isn't the coronavirus itself that kills a patient, but the patient's extreme inflammatory response. The immune system floods the cells with proteins called cytokines. When the body produces a rush of cytokines - known as a cytokine storm - blood vessels become weak, allowing fluid to leak in and fill the lung cavities. This can shut down organs and make recovery difficult.</p><p>Jones compares the body's response to a forest fire. It's not too difficult to extinguish a match. But once the match has been dropped and the brush begins to burn and the fire spreads, the devastation is more extensive and the resources needed to stop the fire are more substantial.</p><p>Jones thinks the treatment many COVID-19 patients are receiving needs to occur in an earlier stage. On March 27, he administered to Brown a medicine called Actemra, a brand of tocilizumab, which disabled Brown's inflammatory response by blocking specific cytokines called interleukin-6 or IL-6.</p><p>Actemra hasn't been approved to treat the coronavirus but it has shown promising results across the U.S. and in China. Roche, the Swiss maker of the drug, received $25 million from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority last week to accelerate the drug's trial. The medicine is traditionally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Brown was in Stage II of the disease, about to cross the line into Stage III, in which the viral response gives way to a dangerous inflammatory response. The forest fire was about to ignite.</p><p>So Jones infused the medicine in Stage II before Brown's inflammatory response went haywire. The theories Jones had developed years ago as a fellow at VCU were being put to use and the results were dramatic. Work he had begun years ago was culminating in this case.</p><p>\"It's like the puzzle you've been working on all your life and you finally get all the pieces and they fall into place,\" Jones said. \"Which is amazing to me.\"</p><p>Understanding the intersection of the body's immune system and its inflammatory system, Jones said, could be the \"vital link\" the health community has been missing for decades. Decades of trials hoping to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome resulted in few answers.</p><p>There are drawbacks to using Actemra. It's expensive, costing between $3,000 and $5,000 per dose, and its supply is limited. Much of what has been produced is delivered to New York and Italy, where it is needed most.</p><p>Jones prescribed one other unconventional treatment - intravenous vitamin C. He had called Dr. Alpha \"Berry\" Fowler, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University who runs the lab where Jones was a fellow. Fowler suggested the vitamin C.</p><p>Vitamin C isn't an approved treatment for the coronavirus, either, and it isn't recommended by Bon Secours. But the playbook for treating COVID-19 is being written on the fly, and Fowler says there's a growing amount of anecdotal evidence that vitamin C might be effective in treating COVID-19. Fowler is hoping a clinical trial to approve the use of vitamin C in COVID-19 patients will begin this summer.</p><p>A large amount of vitamin C is injected - 4,000 to 5,000 times the normal amount in the bloodstream. Whether it was the timing of the Actemra, the vitamin C or the combination of medicines that saved Brown is unknown.</p><p>\"There are a number of ways, I think, of getting at this virus,\" Fowler said. \"Dr. Jones pressed the right buttons.\"</p><p>THE RECOVERY</p><p>The drugs began to take their effect in Brown's lungs, binding with the proteins and preventing inflammation. The response was nearly instantaneous.</p><p>In 45 minutes he began to feel a change. Within two hours his discomfort had subsided. His fever diminished and his heart rate slowed.</p><p>On March 28, Brown received a second dose of Actemra. A day later, a Sunday, he felt well enough to go home. The day after that he did go home. In three days he had gone from his body almost being overrun by the disease to leaving the hospital.</p><p>\"I've never seen anybody recover as quickly as he did with that level of disease,\" Jones said.</p><p>Jones wrote up a case report detailing his treatment and the results. Bon Secours' protocols for treating COVID-19 have grown to at least 51 pages.</p><p>Doctors are sharing what they've learned, some using Facebook to update one another. Other doctors heard of Jones' approach by word of mouth and they're starting to follow his lead.</p><p>Physicians like Jones are fighting the virus on two fronts, treating the patients in front of them while also studying the disease in hopes of being more prepared for the next patient. He says he's cried as much in the past two or three weeks as he has in the past two or three decades. But Jeff Brown is a big reason for hope.</p><p>\"I'm incredibly grateful I got the care that I got, both from the shift-to-shift bedside nursing and staff and from my physicians,\" Brown said.</p><p>While Brown was required to wait 72 hours without a fever before he could return to work, he delayed his return by an extra week. He was retested, as were all his family members, and all the tests came back negative.</p><p>His wife and daughter tested negative for the COVID-19 antibody, meaning they had never contracted the virus despite riding the same trains and planes from London to the U.S.</p><p>\"It'll be impossible for me to figure out where I got it,\" he said.</p><p>By April 9, Brown was back in a health care setting, but instead of being treated he was seeing patients of his own. Soon he'll be able to donate his plasma and its antibodies to the American Red Cross.</p><p>Not long after his release from the hospital he felt so healthy he started to work on his taxes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020041857766519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPB-JBM1-F103-345C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The local vascular surgeon had tested positive for COVID-19, and after three days in the hospital his health was only getting worse. The oxygen level in his blood was low, a condition known as hypoxemia, and respiratory failure was a serious concern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the lungs go, oxygen can't be delivered to the rest of the body. Tissues will die and other will organs follow, like one domino knocking over another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But thanks to some quick thinking by his doctor and a yet-to-be-approved treatment that is showing potential to stave off the most detrimental effects of the coronavirus, Brown made a swift and dramatic turnaround.</p><p>\"Within two hours, I felt like a new person,\" said Brown, 57.</p><p>The physician who treated Brown is a close colleague, Dr. Drew Jones. Maybe it was providence that the man entrusted with Brown's well-being had spent years studying how the immune system reacts to disease in the lungs.</p><p>Jones, it turns out, was in the perfect position to save his colleague's life.</p><p>THE ILLNESS</p><p>On March 5, Brown flew to London to return his daughter to the U.S. from her semester abroad through New York University. He took precautions, wearing a mask on each flight and packing hand sanitizer in his bag.</p><p>He returned home the morning of Saturday, March 14, and when he entered the U.S. at the Detroit airport he wasn't required to undergo an enhanced screening.</p><p>Before returning to work at Bon Secours' Memorial Regional Medical Center in Hanover County, he spoke with the administration and others to explain where he had travelled and when he would return. Many other doctors who had travelled recently went through the same process, and Brown was cleared to return.</p><p>\"We take this thing very, very seriously,\" he said. \"It was a very fluid situation in mid-March.\"</p><p>Any Bon Secours associate who is potentially exposed to the coronavirus is evaluated and monitored by the hospital network and the Virginia Department of Health, Bon Secours spokeswoman Jenna Green said. One other associate who worked directly with Brown did test positive, he said, though it's nearly impossible to know where anyone got the virus.</p><p>He resumed work on Monday, March 16, and later that day the United Kingdom was added to a travel restriction list, which took effect at 11:59 p.m. that night. Among those restrictions: Any traveller returning from the U.K. would need to self-quarantine for 14 days. Having arrived just before the quarantine rule was enacted, Brown worked the entire week.</p><p>On Friday, March 20, Brown began feeling ill. He had typical flu symptoms - fever, shakes, aches and pains - so he stopped working, visited his hospital's emergency room and was tested for the coronavirus. He went home and awaited the results.</p><p>His entire practice was shut down for two weeks. All 11 employees in the Vascular Surgery Associates office in Hanover were sent home with pay. Each patient was contacted and monitored. Every inch of the office was thoroughly cleaned.</p><p>During the next week his condition didn't improve. His fever was unrelenting, his energy depleted. He couldn't eat. On March 24, he returned to the emergency room and was admitted to the hospital.</p><p>Visitors weren't allowed during his stay so he kept his wife updated through phone calls and FaceTime. He spent large portions of the day doing breathing exercises, and when medical staff members entered the room they spent minutes just donning personal protective equipment to safely treat him.</p><p>The standard treatments were administered, including Plaquenil and azithromycin. Plaquenil is a brand of hydroxychloroquine, a drug typically used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other illnesses that President Donald Trump has lauded. Azithromycin is a common respiratory medicine.</p><p>Despite the medicine he was given, Brown's condition didn't improve. Over the next four days his health deteriorated. Seven days after he was tested, results returned confirming what he already knew - he was positive for COVID-19.</p><p>THE TREATMENT</p><p>Jones, the pulmonologist who treated Brown, had already treated one COVID-19 patient. That man was 67 and had been in good health, yet the coronavirus had caused him to suffer cardiac arrest, liver failure and shock. He had been given the normal treatment and the virus had still ravaged his body. Earlier this month the man died.</p><p>Jones, 48, knew a change of direction was needed for other patients. He thought back to the years at the beginning of his career at VCU as a pulmonary and critical care fellow and faculty member. There he researched how the immune system functions in the lungs. He had watched how emphysema and asthma affected mice and rats. He knew that something needed to be done earlier in the sequence of infection to save the lives of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>There's a growing belief in the medical community that it isn't the coronavirus itself that kills a patient, but the patient's extreme inflammatory response. The immune system floods the cells with proteins called cytokines. When the body produces a rush of cytokines - known as a cytokine storm - blood vessels become weak, allowing fluid to leak in and fill the lung cavities. This can shut down organs and make recovery difficult.</p><p>Jones compares the body's response to a forest fire. It's not too difficult to extinguish a match. But once the match has been dropped and the brush begins to burn and the fire spreads, the devastation is more extensive and the resources needed to stop the fire are more substantial.</p><p>Jones thinks the treatment many COVID-19 patients are receiving needs to occur in an earlier stage. On March 27, he administered to Brown a medicine called Actemra, a brand of tocilizumab, which disabled Brown's inflammatory response by blocking specific cytokines called interleukin-6 or IL-6.</p><p>Actemra hasn't been approved to treat the coronavirus but it has shown promising results across the U.S. and in China. Roche, the Swiss maker of the drug, received $25 million from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority last week to accelerate the drug's trial. The medicine is traditionally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Brown was in Stage II of the disease, about to cross the line into Stage III, in which the viral response gives way to a dangerous inflammatory response. The forest fire was about to ignite.</p><p>So Jones infused the medicine in Stage II before Brown's inflammatory response went haywire. The theories Jones had developed years ago as a fellow at VCU were being put to use and the results were dramatic. Work he had begun years ago was culminating in this case.</p><p>\"It's like the puzzle you've been working on all your life and you finally get all the pieces and they fall into place,\" Jones said. \"Which is amazing to me.\"</p><p>Understanding the intersection of the body's immune system and its inflammatory system, Jones said, could be the \"vital link\" the health community has been missing for decades. Decades of trials hoping to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome resulted in few answers.</p><p>There are drawbacks to using Actemra. It's expensive, costing between $3,000 and $5,000 per dose, and its supply is limited. Much of what has been produced is delivered to New York and Italy, where it is needed most.</p><p>Jones prescribed one other unconventional treatment - intravenous vitamin C. He had called Dr. Alpha \"Berry\" Fowler, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University who runs the lab where Jones was a fellow. Fowler suggested the vitamin C.</p><p>Vitamin C isn't an approved treatment for the coronavirus, either, and it isn't recommended by Bon Secours. But the playbook for treating COVID-19 is being written on the fly, and Fowler says there's a growing amount of anecdotal evidence that vitamin C might be effective in treating COVID-19. Fowler is hoping a clinical trial to approve the use of vitamin C in COVID-19 patients will begin this summer.</p><p>A large amount of vitamin C is injected - 4,000 to 5,000 times the normal amount in the bloodstream. Whether it was the timing of the Actemra, the vitamin C or the combination of medicines that saved Brown is unknown.</p><p>\"There are a number of ways, I think, of getting at this virus,\" Fowler said. \"Dr. Jones pressed the right buttons.\"</p><p>THE RECOVERY</p><p>The drugs began to take their effect in Brown's lungs, binding with the proteins and preventing inflammation. The response was nearly instantaneous.</p><p>In 45 minutes he began to feel a change. Within two hours his discomfort had subsided. His fever diminished and his heart rate slowed.</p><p>On March 28, Brown received a second dose of Actemra. A day later, a Sunday, he felt well enough to go home. The day after that he did go home. In three days he had gone from his body almost being overrun by the disease to leaving the hospital.</p><p>\"I've never seen anybody recover as quickly as he did with that level of disease,\" Jones said.</p><p>Jones wrote up a case report detailing his treatment and the results. Bon Secours' protocols for treating COVID-19 have grown to at least 51 pages.</p><p>Doctors are sharing what they've learned, some using Facebook to update one another. Other doctors heard of Jones' approach by word of mouth and they're starting to follow his lead.</p><p>Physicians like Jones are fighting the virus on two fronts, treating the patients in front of them while also studying the disease in hopes of being more prepared for the next patient. He says he's cried as much in the past two or three weeks as he has in the past two or three decades. But Jeff Brown is a big reason for hope.</p><p>\"I'm incredibly grateful I got the care that I got, both from the shift-to-shift bedside nursing and staff and from my physicians,\" Brown said.</p><p>While Brown was required to wait 72 hours without a fever before he could return to work, he delayed his return by an extra week. He was retested, as were all his family members, and all the tests came back negative.</p><p>His wife and daughter tested negative for the COVID-19 antibody, meaning they had never contracted the virus despite riding the same trains and planes from London to the U.S.</p><p>\"It'll be impossible for me to figure out where I got it,\" he said.</p><p>By April 9, Brown was back in a health care setting, but instead of being treated he was seeing patients of his own.

Reporter Sarah Simpson has been combing through old newspapers with the assistance of the Kaatza Station Museum and Archives so we can jog your memory, give you that nostalgic feeling, or just a chuckle, as we take a look at what was making headlines this week around Cowichan Lake in years gone by.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week around the Cowichan Lake area&amp;#x26;#8230;</p><p>10 years ago</p><p>It was a big day a decade ago as a \"Wealth of logging history\" was loaded into the Kaatza Station Museum, according to the July 14, 2010 Lake Cowichan Gazette.</p><p>Kaatza Station Museum volunteers were hard at work in the heat Thursday, July 8, hauling a few car loads full of boxes and filing cabinets, as well as a refrigerator into the museum's Bell Tower School. The piles, overflowing from a few vehicles, had come all the way from Duncan's United Steelworkers Hall, formerly called the International Woodworkers of America (IWA) Hall, on a long-term loan to the museum.</p><p>\"They're selling the building,\" Kaatza Station Museum curator Barbara Simkins said of the United Steelworkers Hall. \"We were afraid [the material] would get lost, and this is important.\" The piles of materials include photographs and other artifacts from the IWA's long history in the Cowichan Lake area.</p><p>Page two of the July 14, 2010 Lake Cowichan Gazette had CVRD Area F director Ian Morrison pointing from across the street to a new traffic camera set up on Highway 18 by the Skutz Falls turnoff.</p><p>\"Looking way ahead to winter driving safety, the Ministry of Transportation has installed a new camera on Highway 18 at the Skutz Falls turnoff in order to help drivers better plan their winter trips to and from the Cowichan Lake area. The images the camera will be taking will be available online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.images.drivebc.ca/bchighwaycam\">www.images.drivebc.ca/bchighwaycam</url>, a website that is updated every couple of minutes.</p><p>\"It'll help the whole area, so people can be safe when they're traveling this road,\" CVRD director Ian Morrison said of Highway 18.</p><p>\"Morrison, whose electoral Area F includes Skutz Falls, has been lobbying for a camera at that location for over a year, and happily announced his success last week with the newly installed camera.\"</p><p>\"It'll ensure safety on this road.\"</p><p>25 years ago</p><p>Was it the start of the Island Corridor Foundation?</p><p>It was in the Lake News of July 12, 1995 that then town counsellor Jack Peake announced his belief the E&amp;amp;N railway should be taken over by the provincial government.</p><p>\"I think the province should take over the ownership of the E&amp;amp;N,\" he told the Lake News when asked to comment on the new act introduced by MLA Jan Pullinger in the B.C. Legislature.</p><p>\"Peake is a member of an unofficial group of municipal officials which is interested in the future of the E&amp;amp;N,\" the story continued.</p><p>\"I think the Act is a step in the right direction,\" he said.</p><p>\"I believe the train runs in the wrong direction. It should start in Courtenay and run to Victoria. Originally it was intended to take the line to Campbell River and on to Port Hardy. We should be looking at the best way to run the line. Perhaps some extra shorter runs would be beneficial.\"</p><p>\"Peak suggested that the right-of-way might be a valuable asset for public transportation in the future.\"</p><p>Twenty-five years later, the people are still wondering what will become of the E&amp;amp;N.</p><p>It was a disappointing time for the Lakeside Players but they had a great time anyway at the 62nd Annual Provincial Theatre Festival in Kamloops this time 25 years ago.</p><p>The group took their production of Odd Couple to the festival but didn't win any awards.</p><p>\"We had the only full house of the week,\" said director Dena McPhee.</p><p>She also noted that Lake Cowichan Mayor Earle Darling and his wife Marjorie attended the performance and even personally picked up the entire cast's tab at a local restaurant later.</p><p>40 years ago</p><p>History sure isn't repeating itself when it comes to this story from 40 years ago.</p><p>\"Lake Cowichan gas prices rank among lowest in province: survey\" was the headline of The Lake News of July 9, 1980. Don't we all wish.</p><p>But those low prices were needed as another big bold headline on the front page of the same edition was \"Market slump forces 1,600 loggers home.\"</p><p>That's some perfect timing for a lot of laid off workers.</p><p>\"Most woods operations will be shut down earlier than usual this summer and the early shut down was criticized Tuesday by a union official. Ken McEwan, business agent for International Woodworkers of American Local 1-80, said that the union doesn't accept what some see as too-casual a closure by companies.</p><p>\"If we want to shut down an operation, we have to have a supervised strike vote, but when the company decides they don't want to do business, everyone just accepts it,\" McEwan said in an interview. \"We don't accept that.\"</p><p>\"About 1,600 loggers and sawmill workers in the Cowichan Lake area will be subject to layoffs which started earlier than usual this summer. In previous years, layoffs &amp; - usually because of forest fire hazards &amp; - started in August.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike\">sarah.simpson@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAKECG-4023615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAKECG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BP-2CS1-F103-34HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lake Cowichan Gazette</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0003YHS</classCode><className>STE DES AUTOROUTES RHONE-ALPES SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA US AFL-CIO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS237310 HIGHWAY, STREET &amp; BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC1611 HIGHWAY &amp; STREET CONSTRUCTION, EXCEPT ELEVATED HIGHWAYS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DRK8</classCode><className>BLUE COLLAR WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009ZGJ</classCode><className>ELECTORAL DISTRICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOAS</classCode><className>TRAFFIC CAMERAS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Gothic masterpiece, which was not completed until 1880, was hit 14 times by bombs during the Second World War but did not collapse. Today it is a UNESCO world heritage site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1556, Protestant leader John Knox appeared at the Church of Blackfriars in Edinburgh to face charges of heresy.

The Robson Commission, which later investigated the walkout by 30,000 workers, found it had been aimed only at improving wages and labour's bargaining position. But most government bodies feared a Bolshevik revolution was brewing. A number of labour leaders were jailed under wartime sedition laws, which were not repealed until 1936.</p><p>In 1930, registered nurse Ellen Church, the first airline stewardess, went on duty aboard an Oakland-to-Chicago flight operated by Boeing Air Transport (a forerunner of United Airlines).</p><p>In 1940, the first nylon stockings went on sale in Wilmington, Delaware, where 780,000 pairs were sold the first day.

The world's largest commercial landlord had been hit hard by declining real estate prices.</p><p>In 1995, China conducted an underground nuclear test, just days after it had agreed to an extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p><p>In 2006, the U.S. restored full diplomatic relations with Libya.</p><p>In 2006, Iraqi officials formally charged Saddam Hussein with crimes against humanity, including the torture of women and children, murder and the illegal arrest of 399 people in a crackdown against Shiites in the 1980's.

The guidelines dubbed the \"Christchurch Call'' were named for the New Zealand city where 51 people were killed in a March attack on mosques that was broadcast live on Facebook.  The tech companies committed to measures to prevent the spread of terrorist or violent extremist content. </p><p>----</p><p>(The Canadian Press)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-36a79dcb514f4c478e7445b6c9e172aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT9-HG51-JBVR-31W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 1, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Total consideration for the transaction was the assumption of approximately $250,000 in liabilities and $1 million in restricted common stock of Taronis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The transaction benefits the Company in several ways. First, the Company now irrevocably owns the entire patent portfolio it had previously licensed from BBHC. Second, the transaction limits the potential cost of future royalties significantly. Under the prior licensing agreement, Taronis had previously agreed to pay a 7% royalty for the exclusive use of all fuel applications derived from the acquired patent portfolio. As part of the transaction, royalty payments remain unchanged for the first five years, but cease entirely thereafter. This has the potential to save the Company significant costs in the future as it looks to expand its sales of MagneGas, the only renewable metal cutting fuel, new fuel products for the propane and other heating end markets, and the sale of its proprietary Venturi plasma arc gasification units.</p><p>The transaction also significantly simplifies the business model for near term business objectives. The Company is actively exploring an uplisting to a national exchange, and this new, simplified business model where the entire intellectual property portfolio is proprietary, wholly owned and actively used for ongoing commercial activities is expected to enhance the Company's business narrative meaningfully.</p><p>\"We are very pleased to complete this transaction as structured,\" commented Scott Mahoney, CEO of Taronis Fuels. \"We are working diligently to launch several relatively large commercial opportunities involving our technology overseas in the coming quarters. We believe that as those activities begin to translate into tangible financial results, the geographic footprint of commercial opportunity for our Company will expand exponentially. We felt compelled to act now, take control of the underlying intellectual property, and accelerate the development of new fuel products for new markets.\"</p><p>\"This transaction is almost entirely about our ability to internally fund and drive the pace of new development. We want to launch our fourth-generation gasification prototype, which has the potential to reduce our cost to produce synthetic fuels by up to 90%. It would also enable us to begin directly gasifying new solid feedstocks such as plastics, forest fire biomass, and a wide range of other materials.\"</p><p>\"We can now fully drive the pipeline of new synthetic fuel product development. We can accelerate the validation of our first renewable propane substitute. We are also looking at applications to use different variations of our fuel product as a cost-effective additive to traditional fossil fuel combustion engines, making them burn cleaner, with a reduced carbon footprint.\"</p><p>\"To accomplish this, we have begun building out full scale, science-driven research and development capabilities at our new Peoria, Arizona technical campus. We are not just looking to drive process improvement; we want to innovate beyond our current expertise. To accomplish this objective, we are actively seeking PH.D. level expertise in physics, chemistry, combustion engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and a wide range of related skillsets. We intend to build a world-class technical team to significantly expand the addressable end user applications for our patent portfolio in early 2021. We aspire to be the global leader in cost-effective, hydrogen-based fossil fuel replacement products,\" concluded Mr. Mahoney.</p><p>About Taronis Fuels, Inc.</p><p>Taronis Fuels, Inc. is a global producer of renewable and socially responsible fuel products. Our goal is to deliver environmentally sustainable, technology driven alternatives to traditional fossil fuel and carbon-based economy products. We believe our products offer a vastly cleaner solution to legacy acetylene and propane alternatives.</p><p>Taronis is also dedicated to providing fundamentally safer solutions to meet the industrial, commercial and residential needs of tomorrow's global economy. Our products have been rigorously tested and independently validated by global gas authorities as vastly safer than acetylene, the most dangerous industrial gas in use today.</p><p>Lastly, we strive to deliver products that offer significant function superiority at a reduced cost to the end consumer. Through these efforts, we support 9 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

This is why the Government of Canada is investing in clean energy projects across the territories, so that, together, we can work to achieve Canada's commitment to transitioning Indigenous communities away from diesel by 2030 while prioritizing reconciliation, self-determination, and community-led clean energy projects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon, on behalf of the Honourable Seamus O'Regan, Canada's Minister of Natural Resources, today announced a $5.4-million investment in five community-led clean energy projects in Yukon. This funding will support communities in their efforts to build a cleaner future and reduce their reliance on diesel fuel for heat and power while creating jobs.</p><p>The investments are: </p><p> $2.1 million to Carcross/Tagish First Nation to install a biomass district heating system to displace existing electric and fossil fuel heating systems in five community buildings; $1.6 million to the Yukon Conservation Society to evaluate the technical feasibility and customer acceptance of utility-controlled electric thermal storage heaters that can provide reliable electricity capacity; $800,000 to Teslin Tlingit Council to construct a biomass district heating system for eight new duplexes, including 16 housing units, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs for the community; $574,000 to the Government of Yukon to work collaboratively with Yukon First Nations to evaluate and address gaps that delay the deployment of energy projects in communities; and $345,900 to Kluane First Nation to develop a forest resources management plan for the First Nation settlement lands to meet current and future local biomass heating needs. </p><p>Funding for the projects is from the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities program. The six-year, $220-million program aims to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in rural and remote communities by deploying and demonstrating renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency and building local skills and capacity. It is part of the government's Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, a $180-billion investment over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes and Canada's rural and northern communities.</p><p>The government supports innovative energy initiatives that reduce our carbon footprint, create healthier communities and provide opportunities for economic development. This commitment will be more important than ever as we reopen the economy and plan our recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"These communities are fighting climate change by taking control of their energy futures and being leaders in the clean energy economy.\" </p><p>The Honourable Seamus O'ReganCanada's Minister of Natural Resources</p><p>\"Clean energy is central to achieve net zero by 2050. Our government continues to work with Indigenous communities to transition away from diesel reliance and to invest in community-driven projects in remote and rural communities.\"</p><p>Larry Bagnell Member of Parliament for Yukon</p><p>\"With the Government of Canada's Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities funding, the Government of Yukon has launched a three-year initiative to better support Yukon First Nations with local energy projects. We are excited to be working in partnership with Yukon First Nations as we move toward a low-carbon energy supply that meets our territory's growing demands and facilitates ongoing economic growth and prosperity in Yukon.\"</p><p>The Honourable Ranj Pillai Government of Yukon Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources\u00a0</p><p>\"The Yukon Conservation Society is appreciative of NRCan's support for the Yukon Electric Thermal Storage (ETS) Demonstration Project during such a crucial time in the advancements of green energy projects in Yukon. We would not have had this opportunity to demonstrate the potential for electric thermal storage to assist in Yukon's pursuit of a greener future without this funding. This project represents steps forward toward the renewable-powered, energy-independent Yukon that the Yukon Conservation Society has been working toward for over 50 years.\"</p><p>Coral Voss Executive Director, Yukon Conversation Society</p><p>\"Biomass technology presents economic opportunities for the TTC and its citizens while reducing forest fire risks around Teslin and its Traditional Territory. The ultimate goal of the Teslin Community Energy Strategy is to provide the community with the complete means to be energy self-sufficient.\" </p><p>Chief Richard Sidney Teslin Tlingit Council</p><p>\"The Kluane First Nation Forest Resources Management Plan project strengthens Kluane First Nation's ability to self-govern in a planned and measured way. This project has strengthened community resilience through the identification of local resources for biomass heating, as well as provided our community with valuable skills in the forestry sector that will see many benefits into the future. Kluane First Nation would like to express appreciation to Natural Resources Canada for its support of this project.\"</p><p>Chief Bob Dickson Kluane First Nation</p><p>\"Our environment is key to our way of life, and we are committed to continue finding ways to produce clean energy.

A trillion trees, it was said at that meeting of the World Economic Forum, would go a long way in addressing climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while trees - and particularly forests full of trees - are vital for swallowing up and storing carbon, and currently absorb 30 per cent of planet-warming carbon dioxide, they are also extremely vulnerable in the age of climate disruptions.</p><p>In a hotter, drier, more flammable climate, like here in the Mediterranean region, forests can die slowly from drought, or they can go up in flames almost instantly, releasing all the carbon stored in their trunks and branches into the atmosphere.</p><p>That raises an increasingly urgent question: How best to manage woodlands in a world that humans have so profoundly altered? \"We need to decide what will be the climate-change forest for the future,\" is how Kirsten Thonicke, a fire ecologist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, framed the challenge.</p><p>A forest revival in Europe is forcing that discussion now.</p><p>Today roughly 40 per cent of the European Union's land mass is covered by trees, making it one of the most forest-rich regions in the world. It's also ripe for wildfire.</p><p>In 2019, intense heat and drought helped spread fires across roughly 1,300 square miles on the Continent, a swath of scorched land 15 per cent bigger than the decade's annual average, according to preliminary data issued in mid-January by the European Forest Fire Information System.</p><p>Marc Castellnou, a 47-year-old fire analyst with the Catalonian fire services, has seen that shift firsthand here in the hot, dry hills of Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where his family has lived for generations in a medieval village overlooking the Ebro River.</p><p>His mother's family grew almonds up here. The terraces they once hacked into these hard rocks still remain, along with the brick oven of the old farmhouse and a row of juniper trees, which, by local custom, signalled to anyone walking up from the coast that they could barter their fish for bread there.</p><p>The almond orchard has long been abandoned. In its place, a scrubby forest of short oaks and white pines has come up. Where goats once grazed, there is now a carpet of dry grass. A perfect landscape for fire.</p><p>What happened with his ancestors' farm has played out across Europe, profoundly altering the countryside over the past half century. As farmers walked away from the land in favour of less back-breaking, more profitable ventures, forests came back.</p><p>Now Castellnou has been setting some of those forests ablaze, getting rid of the grasses and low-lying shrub so the flames cannot as easily race up to the crowns of the young, frail pines. The last thing he wants his two young children to inherit is a hillside strewn with dry, flammable brush.</p><p>His ancestors chose a steep hillside and planted almonds. The grandparents of his wife, Rut Dom\u00e8nech, 39, cultivated hazelnuts. Nearly everyone had olives to supply oil for the year. Some grew grapes to make wine. Every bit of hill was under cultivation.</p><p>By the second half of the 20th century, Catalonians had begun abandoning the steepest, hardest-to-farm hillsides in favour of the valleys, where machines and fertilizers made farming easier and more productive.</p><p>Farming fell out of favour. The shepherds sold their animals.</p><p>Across Europe, between 1950 and 2010, amid rapid postwar reconstruction, woods and grasslands grew by roughly 150,000 square miles.</p><p>Farmers in the Montsant wine region of Catalonia now harvest earlier in the season; the heat sweetens the grapes too early, and some worry whether they'll have to switch to dessert wines.</p><p>On an exceptionally hot day last summer, on a poultry farm, a pile of manure caught fire, as mounds of animal waste have done before. But so fierce was the wind that the embers travelled across the hills, causing fires up to 13 miles (21 kilometres) away.</p><p>Fire, Castellnou pointed out more than once, is nature's way of reshaping the landscape for the future. What will come up on these denuded hills will be less homogeneous, he said, and more resilient for a new climate.</p><p>He favours what he calls managed burns, getting rid of low brush in order to prevent the next fire from raging out of control. And sometimes, he favours letting fires burn. It's part of the natural ecology of the forest, he said. The white pines, for instance, reproduce only during fires, when their seed pods explode in the heat.</p><p>\"Instead of fighting fire, making peace with fire,\" Castellnou advised.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2020020857144121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5C-N8S1-JDH1-C1K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Monday, Dec. 19, there were 19 speed cameras active according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 last year with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Thursday, Nov. 24, 17 speed cameras of 22 were activated.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Wednesday, Jan. 4, there were 17 active speed cameras according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in the Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> As of Tuesday, Dec. 13, all 22 speed cameras were active according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Artesian Drive, between Auckland Avenue and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

If they\u2019re unable to raise the funds to pur- chase the property, it will be sold privately.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 153-acre property is a rare privately owned parcel in the middle of a globally significant wilderness area:southern Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, B.C. \u2019s largest park at almost one million hectares. It is located 60 kms east of Bella Coola and accessible by float plane or by hiking the Hunlen Falls/Turner Lake Chain Trail.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The original homestead, known as The Birches, was built by Ralph Edwards, a pioneering homestead- er, amateur pilot, and conservationist. Unfortunately The Birches burnt to the ground in a 2004 forest fire, but Ralph\u2019s son John Edwards constructed a small cabin in its place which still stands there today.</p><p>Ralph was born in 1891 in North Carolina and came to British Columbia as a young man, finding work on a railroad construction crew. Edwards\u2019 passion for farming and mountains came together when he learned he could get free land in British Columbia as part of a provincial homesteading program. Between the ages of 17 and 21, he taught himself how to be a farmer using books and working as a farmhand.</p><p>In 1912, at the age of 21, he was granted a 160-acre tract in the Atnarko valley on the eastern edge of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia that he transformed, alone for over a decade, into The Birches. He rarely left the farm, and could only bring in from the outside what he could carry on his back and packhorse over a difficult moun- tainous trail, which took at least two days to traverse.</p><p>\u201cRalph Edwards had a vision. A vision of the perfect homestead, where he would find peace and quiet and the freedom to live life on his terms. There would be mountains, a lake and endless forests stretching into forever, bountiful land he could grow crops on, and trees perfectly sized for building,\u201d said his granddaughter Susan Turner. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s love affair with Lonesome Lake and the Atnarko Valley would continue for over fifty years.\u201d</p><p>In 1917 he enlisted with the United States Army and fought in WWI before being discharged nine months after the armistice.</p><p>\u201cHe served in Northern France and I think he returned from that a sadder, older and perhaps wiser man, certainly even more appreciative of the quiet serenity of Lonesome Lake,\u201d Turner recalled.</p><p>He returned to Bella Coola and married local girl Ethel Hober in 1923. Ethel, possessing the same self-sufficient spirit as Ralph, said \u201cRalph used to walk 40 miles across frozen lakes and rivers just to court me!\u201d After a suitable amount of time to get acquainted, and her mother for a chaperone, Ethel made the trip in to Lonesome Lake to see the homestead she had heard so much about. It must have met with her approval, for they were married in August 1923.</p><p>She joined him at The Birches and they went on to have three children:Stanley, John and Trudy. The Edwards\u2019 schooled their children through a correspondence system with the help of Ralph\u2019s extensive home library.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what fears and worries my grandmother kept to herself when she became pregnant with her third child. When Ralph was away on his trapline, she would be left alone for days on an isolated homestead with a very rambunctious, imaginative five year old and a no doubt busy toddler in the midst of his terrible twos,\u201d shared Turner.</p><p>\u201cThat was on top of milking, cooking, looking after livestock, sewing, all the regular chores on a farm. There must have been days she would have given anything to have her mother and sisters around to help out or just for support.\u201d</p><p>During their time at The Birches the Edwards family became experts at self-sufficiency. They managed to create a water-powered saw mill, and even an electric-generator powered by the river. Ralph studied for over a decade to build an airplane, teaching himself advanced mathematics and aeronautic engineering, although in the end he was forced to buy a used plane due to legal restrictions.</p><p>\u201cRalph had a powerful hankering for an airplane. He longed to fly, always had from when he was just a boy and flight was just beginning. In his usual do-ityourself style he decided he would learn all he could from textbooks and build an airplane. Why not, he had built a lot of other supposedly impossible things, often greatly aided by Trudy\u2019s equally inventive brain as she grew up,\u201d said Turner. \u201cShe was just as fascinated by airplanes as he was. He would need to buy an engine, of course, and all the parts, but surely he could figure out the rest. They both studied and planned and designed until Ralph thought he was ready to begin. Various parts including the engine were bought with very hard earned money and horse packed in. And then the crushing disappointment when they learned it could never be certified for flight, and even if it could be, that might take years. Now what?\u201d His daughter Trudy learned to fly first, but Ralph did obtain his pilot\u2019s license at age 62 after only 28 hours of instruction; at the time, he was the oldest pilot in Canada to ever qualify. During his physical his doctor said he was healthier than men half his age.</p><p>Ralph was perhaps best known for his commitment to the area\u2019s trumpeter swans, who were facing extinction when he took up residence at Lonesome Lake in 1912. When Edwards first arrived, Lonesome Lake was home to a gaggle of trumpeter swan refugees, a species fac- ing extinction due to over-hunting in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>The lake\u2019s remoteness offered the swans safety, but at the cost of starvation during severe winters. In 1925, the Canadian government enlisted Edwards\u2019 help to feed the swans during winter. Over the years, a number of family members took on the task \u2013 first Ralph, then Stan, John, and Trudy \u2013 using sacks of corn which were hauled in by packhorse.</p><p>During Princess Elizabeth\u2019s 1951 tour of Canada, she was promised a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, by arrangement of British conservationist Peter Scott, who was head of the Severn Wildlife Trust in Britain (now known as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust). Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake as they had been fed by Edwards family for decades.</p><p>In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy Turner (Trudy had by now entirely taken over the feeding of them), five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although, in the 19th century, the swans had been brought by ship to European zoos).</p><p>Ralph was awarded the Order of Canada in 1972 for his work and by the 1980s, trumpeter swan populations had increased throughout their range, and the Canadian government stopped its feeding program.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to pick one single thing that made life at Lonesome Lake incredibly special for my grandparents and my mother, especially, I think it would be the swans,\u201d said Turner. \u201cFor Ralph, they were one of the natural beauties of the world, one of the things that made life worth living, a direct quote from him. My mother remembered lying in bed at night and listening to their wild, beautiful calls on moonlit nights, a swan concert, she called it.\u201d</p><p>Both Ralph and members of his family have either written or been featured in several books and television programs, most notably Leland Stowe\u2019s best-selling Crusoe of Lonesome Lake and his sister-in-law\u2019s book Ruffles on My Longjohns.</p><p>Ralph became semi-famous for his living off the land accomplishments and was featured in a documentary and on the 1957 Christmas Day edition of This Is Your Life. Guests for the show included his younger brother, whom he had not seen in 35 years; former Army comrades he had not seen in 38 years; and his 93-yearold mother.</p><p>Ralph passed away in 1977 and John in 2007. The property remains in the family and the push is on for the BC Parks Foundation to raise the funds to purchase this unique piece of land.

Fire officials said they'd never seen a fire move so fast in forestland &amp; - 15 miles (24 kilometres) in a day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, a wildfire in Plumas National Forest northeast of San Francisco spread 25 miles (40 kilometres) in a day and devoured an estimated 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometres),</p><p>In between those events, a massive fire in Monterey County doubled in size overnight, trapping 14 firefighters who had to deploy their emergency shelters; one was critically injured.</p><p>They are only the latest examples of what a half-dozen fire experts agreed is more extreme fire behaviour driven by drought and warming temperatures they attribute to climate change. Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations.</p><p>Recently \"we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, and 30 years or more ago that just wasn't fire behaviour that we saw,\" said Jacob Bendix, a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires.</p><p>Hotter temperatures, longer fire seasons and an estimated 140 million dead trees from a five-year drought mean that \"fires in California are moving faster and growing larger,\" said University of Utah fire expert Philip Dennison.</p><p>READ MORE: Smoky skies and air quality concerns impact the Lower Mainland for a second day</p><p>Mike Flannigan, who directs the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at Canada's University of Alberta, remembers the first report of a fire-created thunderstorm in 1986.</p><p>\"They were rare events, and now they've become commonplace,\" he said. \"It's because these fires are higher intensity.\"</p><p>A prime example is the so-called Creek Fire in Sierra National Forest near Yosemite National Park, which exploded through miles of drought- and beetle-killed timber, moving so fast that it trapped hundreds of campers.</p><p>\"When you have a fire run 15 miles in one day, in one afternoon, there's no model that can predict that,\" U.S. Forest Service forester Steve Lohr said. \"\"The fires are behaving in such a way that we've not seen.\"</p><p>The phenomenon isn't restricted to California. Doug Grafe, chief of Fire Protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry, said it was unprecedented in his state for fires this week to spread from the crest of the Cascade Mountains into the valleys below, and so quickly, \"carrying tens of miles in one period of an afternoon and not slowing down in the evening &amp; - (there is) absolutely no context for that in this environment.\"</p><p>California already has seen a record 3,900 square miles (10,100 square kilometres) burn and it's only now is entering what traditionally is the most dangerous time for fires. Labor Day weekend brought record-breaking temperatures across the state that exacerbated what already are drought conditions in a large swath of the state.</p><p>On Thursday, a Northern California wildfire was threatening thousands of homes after winds whipped it into a monster that incinerated houses in a small mountain community and killed at least three people.</p><p>University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot, dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are \"the highest seen in at least four decades\" across major parts of the West.</p><p>The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy, which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume, \"creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm,\" Flannigan said.</p><p>The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus, which may or may not produce lightning, and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze.</p><p>An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented \"firenado,\" killing a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding.</p><p>Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes, while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced \"a handful\" overnight Tuesday, said Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p><p>The Creek Fire produced at least two firenadoes that appeared to touch down Saturday, he said, one straddling an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped.</p><p>\"It's really kind of a testament to the remarkable extremes that we're seeing right now,\" Lareau said. \"It really is kind of this vicious cycle that it gets into, and that's when the fire really takes off and becomes these unstoppable infernos.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Crews fight growing California wildfires, including one caused by pyrotechnic gender reveal</p><p>Two California National Guard helicopters called in to rescue the trapped campers Saturday night found visibility deteriorating so swiftly that the crews opted to load their aircraft \"to the absolute maximum\" and well beyond normal safety limits in an unprecedented mission.</p><p>On one trip, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Joseph Rosamond and his three-member crew took on 102 desperate campers in a CH-47 Chinook twin-rotor helicopter designed for 30 passengers. A UH-60 Black Hawk ferried 22 evacuees in a helicopter with a normal operating capacity of 11 or 12 passengers.</p><p>The overloaded Chinook slowly climbed to 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) to clear surrounding mountains and dense smoke.</p><p>\"It was an absolute emergency and people's lives were at stake,\" Rosamond recalled. \"It was pretty dicey. The charts don't go that high.\"</p><p>Such harrowing escapes are only likely to become more common, the experts said.</p><p>Columbia University's Williams said California's record heat and record acreage burned already this year are part of a trend that has been accelerating for 50 years due to global warming.</p><p>\"So, while the magnitudes of the current heat wave and the resultant wildfires have been shocking, they're consistent with what scientists have been predicting for decades,\" Williams said in an email.</p><p>___</p><p>Don Thompson, The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-4047013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TG-9R11-F103-3398-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1073\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abbotsford News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations.</p><p>Recently \"we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, and 30 years or more ago that just wasn't fire behaviour that we saw,\" said Jacob Bendix, a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires.</p><p>Hotter temperatures, longer fire seasons and an estimated 140 million dead trees from a five-year drought mean that \"fires in California are moving faster and growing larger,\" said University of Utah fire expert Philip Dennison.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, who directs the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at Canada's University of Alberta, remembers the first report of a fire-created thunderstorm in 1986.</p><p>\"They were rare events, and now they've become commonplace,\" he said. \"It's because these fires are higher intensity.\"</p><p>A prime example is the so-called Creek Fire in Sierra National Forest near Yosemite National Park, which exploded through miles of drought- and beetle-killed timber, moving so fast that it trapped hundreds of campers.</p><p>\"When you have a fire run 15 miles in one day, in one afternoon, there's no model that can predict that,\" U.S. Forest Service forester Steve Lohr said. \"\"The fires are behaving in such a way that we've not seen.\"</p><p>The phenomenon isn't restricted to California. Doug Grafe, chief of Fire Protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry, said it was unprecedented in his state for fires this week to spread from the crest of the Cascade Mountains into the valleys below, and so quickly, \"carrying tens of miles in one period of an afternoon and not slowing down in the evening - (there is) absolutely no context for that in this environment.\"</p><p>California already has seen a record 3,900 square miles (10,100 square kilometres) burn and it's only now is entering what traditionally is the most dangerous time for fires. Labor Day weekend brought record-breaking temperatures across the state that exacerbated what already are drought conditions in a large swath of the state.</p><p>On Thursday, a Northern California wildfire was threatening thousands of homes after winds whipped it into a monster that incinerated houses in a small mountain community and killed at least three people.</p><p>University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot, dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are \"the highest seen in at least four decades\" across major parts of the West.</p><p>The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy, which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume, \"creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm,\" Flannigan said.</p><p>The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus, which may or may not produce lightning, and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze.</p><p>An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented \"firenado,\" killing a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding.</p><p>Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes, while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced \"a handful\" overnight Tuesday, said Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p><p>The Creek Fire produced at least two firenadoes that appeared to touch down Saturday, he said, one straddling an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped.</p><p>\"It's really kind of a testament to the remarkable extremes that we're seeing right now,\" Lareau said. \"It really is kind of this vicious cycle that it gets into, and that's when the fire really takes off and becomes these unstoppable infernos.\"</p><p>Two California National Guard helicopters called in to rescue the trapped campers Saturday night found visibility deteriorating so swiftly that the crews opted to load their aircraft \"to the absolute maximum\" and well beyond normal safety limits in an unprecedented mission.</p><p>On one trip, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Joseph Rosamond and his three-member crew took on 102 desperate campers in a CH-47 Chinook twin-rotor helicopter designed for 30 passengers. A UH-60 Black Hawk ferried 22 evacuees in a helicopter with a normal operating capacity of 11 or 12 passengers.</p><p>The overloaded Chinook slowly climbed to 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) to clear surrounding mountains and dense smoke.</p><p>\"It was an absolute emergency and people's lives were at stake,\" Rosamond recalled. \"It was pretty dicey. The charts don't go that high.\"</p><p>Such harrowing escapes are only likely to become more common, the experts said.</p><p>Columbia University's Williams said California's record heat and record acreage burned already this year are part of a trend that has been accelerating for 50 years due to global warming.</p><p>\"So, while the magnitudes of the current heat wave and the resultant wildfires have been shocking, they're consistent with what scientists have been predicting for decades,\" Williams said in an email.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to say Sierra National Forest, not Sequoia National Forest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dc30bcead69e5b67004711b78bbda868</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T7-RBH1-JBVR-348V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1053\"/><timeReceived>09:54 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The only disaster we have here is racism and human incompetence. But recently, a viral video on X revealed that perhaps, we are not spared after all. It was a scene from hell where fire could be seen spreading across a green landscape.   According to netizen @MyBktJelutong who posted the video, this unbelievable scene was located at Bukit Jelutung. The video can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/MyBktJelutong/status/1983521925692592568\">https://x.com/MyBktJelutong/status/1983521925692592568</url>  In hindsight we would have thought that it was a forest fire happening somewhere in the United States.  Smell of smoke in #BukitJelutong today, due to a forest fire near UiTM Puncak Perdana. pic.twitter.com/yIwZ6c3rbQ  \u2014 BukitJelutong (@MyBktJelutong) October 29, 2025  The Utah 2025 wildfire in Salt Lake City which destroyed more than 160,000 acres of land comes to mind. But in Malaysia?   \u201cThanks PM for d zionist hell of fire,\u201d said netizen @KZLi10, attributing the disaster perhaps, to Anwar Ibrahim welcoming the President of the United States.  \u201cAre the fire fighters not doing their work,\u201d wondered @FadhliRahimMd while @keshvinsidhu sarcastically said that perhaps Malaysia is starting to send our local wood to the United States.  For a better perspective, news media Malay Mail reported that an estimated six acres of forest in the Taman Perdana Heights area caught fire at Jalan Pulau Angsa U10/2 at about 4pm.  \u201cUpon arriving at the location 12 minutes later, the operations commander found that an area of \u200b\u200b0.8 ha had been burnt and extinguishing work was immediately launched with help from the Kapar and Sungai Buloh fire stations,\u201d said Selangor Fire and Rescue Department assistant director of operations Ahmad Mukhlis Mokhtar.  \u201cWith a force of 18 officers and personnel, 80 per cent of the fire zone was extinguished at 6.05 pm and the latest finding at 6.30 am showed that the size of the gutted area was \u200b\u200b2.4 hectares,\u201d he was reportedly quoted by the Malay Mail. \u2014Oct 31, 2025  Main image: @MyBktJelutong (x)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-58063866277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H3G-FMC3-S220-713N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Focus Malaysia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 31, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>U10 Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U10 Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Malaysia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South-Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>ALU10</className><className>PAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>0NQ0</className><className>LTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: FR0000079147</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: FR0000079147</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp;

It will be even harder with learning gaps from two COVID-disrupted school years.</p><p>Whitehorse high school students had their lessons impacted last spring. This semester, they are spending half their schooling time in school and half studying from home. Everyone is doing their best, but if you've spoken to a student or a parent you may have some doubts about how well this half-and-half system is working. Government officials described the situation as \"very challenging\" for some students, and have put more support services in place.</p><p>COVID-19 risks widening our already divided education system. Some families can provide high-speed internet and laptops for their kids to do digital lessons. They can hire one of the many tutors in town. Some kids may be able to zoom into their classes from desks in their own rooms, with a working-from-home parent on hand to encourage.</p><p>But what if you live in a small apartment without your own room? Without your own computer? Maybe without broadband? What if you were already struggling in school even before COVID-19 hit?</p><p>Or if your parents have jobs that leave you alone at home all day?</p><p>What if the school breakfast program was something you looked forward to hungrily, literally?</p><p>It made me wonder what a different approach might look like. Masha Gessen of the New Yorker recently tried to do just this in a visionary piece on what a COVID-era school system might look like in Manhattan. She imagined a system where emergency education funding hired more teachers, and vacant office space was repurposed to set up additional COVID-distanced classrooms.</p><p>It's an interesting thought exercise. And not as outlandish as it might sound. Government agencies have achieved impressive things under the pressure of COVID-19. Stodgy health ministries in some provinces moved quickly to more than double the number of intensive-care beds. The famously conservative Canada Revenue Agency set up &amp; - in just a few weeks! &amp; - a new computer system that handled 27.5 million applications for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p><p>So, what would have to believe for Gessen's vision to be possible here in the Yukon?</p><p>First you would have to believe that the Yukon government could find the money for 60 more staff. The Department of Education estimated that full-time, in-person school for all Whitehorse high school students would require 35 to 60 more educators. Assuming a round number of $100,000 each, those 60 workers are $6 million per year. Media reports indicated the government still had $1.6 million of the federal pandemic schools funding it hadn't spent yet. The remaining $4.4 million represents a quarter of one percent of Yukon government spending this year. The government sucks up far bigger unexpected costs from a bad forest fire season.</p><p>Second, you would have to believe that either a shift system or under-used real estate was available for more classrooms. Some countries have experimented with schools being open longer hours, although this requires classrooms to be cleaned intensively when the second shift of students moves in.</p><p>Another option is satellite classrooms. If you drive around town, a number of options come to mind. The Department of Education itself is the former Vocational School and the officials could work somewhere else. The Legislature and the lobby of the main Administration Building are roomy and in walking distance of F.H. Collins. The new Francophone school was designed for 150 students but only had 85 students when it opened. It's atrium apparently holds 200 people and it has a theatre. Not many conventions are happening in the Westmark conference rooms. How about the Arts Centre or the Old Firehall? The MacBride Museum, Roundhouse or Beringia Centre?</p><p>This would be logistically challenging and of course all the \"safe six\" precautions need to be accounted for. But if New York can set up emergency field hospitals, we can probably figure out a way to hold emergency classes in such settings.</p><p>The third thing you would have to believe is that there are 35 to 60 people in Whitehorse willing to teach on an emergency basis. The options include everyone who could currently be a substitute teacher, which is a lot of people. Think about ex-teachers, retired teachers, recent university graduates, Yukon University part-time instructors, corporate trainers or Yukon Native Teacher Education Program participants.</p><p>These Yukoners would have to be hired, put through a crash course significantly more intensive than what substitute teachers receive currently, and paired with a veteran teacher to improve their effectiveness. Think of it as the Yukon Emergency Teaching Corps.</p><p>Fourth, you would have to believe that the government could do all this in a couple of months. Right now, that's the amount of time before the second semester starts.</p><p>Alas, the thought exercise remains just that. Last week, the Department of Education announced that the half-in-person, half-at-home schooling model would continue for the rest of the year.</p><p>According to the Department, the money was not the obstacle. It was finding the real estate and the 35 to 60 new staff.</p><p>All of the options above have challenges. But it's an emergency. And the logistics of these ideas need to be weighed against the negative impacts to high schoolers by prolonged stretches of remote schooling.</p><p>The good news is that we have two months to come up with creative in-person solutions before next semester starts. It's similar to the problem of how to return the MAD program to its Wood Street home, a problem which appeared unsolvable until the department found a new solution last week.</p><p>Hospital managers and our friends at the Canada Revenue Agency already had their chance to shine. Now safe full-time in-person high school is the Department of Education's opportunity.</p><p>Keith Halliday is a Yukon economist and author of the MacBride Museum's Aurore of the Yukon series of historical children's adventure novels.

(\"Treasury\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce results from an additional 2,300 metres from 13 holes of a planned 30,000 metre diamond drilling program for 2021 at the Goldlund Gold Deposit (\"Goldlund\") located within the larger 100% owned Goliath Gold Complex (the \"Project\" or \"GGC\"), which includes the Goliath, Goldlund and Miller deposits along a prospective 65-kilometre trend in Northwestern Ontario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The exploration program has been designed to ensure the safety of the workforce and surrounding communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and incorporates enhanced operating protocols that are consistent with local health guidance. Treasury Metals is working with the MNRF to mitigate forest fire risks from exploration activities and the Company has continued with exploration activities allowed within the MNDMNRF Emergency Area Order.</p><p>The Company has drilled approximately 16,500 metres (76 holes) to date on the Goldlund Gold Deposit including the results released today, assay results are pending on more than 5,700 metres (27 holes). The 30,000 metre drill program at Goldlund is targeting infill and expansion of known mineralization, as well as exploration step-out targets.</p><p>Jeremy Wyeth, President and CEO of Treasury Metals, commented: \"The drill results we released today continue to illustrate solid intersections of mineralization, further adding to our confidence in our ability to meet our goals of both resource growth and conversion at Goldlund. Several holes released show significant intercepts of near surface mineralization that present opportunities for pit growth and confirm the resource potential within the existing pits. With three drill rigs now mobilized across our properties, we are confident that we can meet our commitment for a 60,000 metre drill program and show the continuity, conversion and growth that we predicted at the start of 2021. These results are some of the most significant results so far at Goldlund in 2021.\"</p><p>The drill program is actively targeting specific areas of conversion within the PEA (filed on SEDAR March 11, 2021) open pit along with additional growth of the resource directly along strike or adjacent of the current resource. Results released today are from holes targeting infill of Zone 1 and expansion on Zone 4. Over the balance of 2021, the Company plans to drill additional zones, as outlined in Figure 1, to test the extension of mineralization across the various zones.</p><p>Results released today, along with the previous results released from drilling at Zone 4 (see June 16, 2021 press release) illustrate the positive continuity of mineralization in Zone 4, including hole GL-21-050, which intersected 0.7 m grading 27.70 g/t Au and 26.0 m grading 2.94 g/t Au (including 1.0 m grading 63.5 g/t Au and 1.0 m grading 8.08 g/t Au), GL-21-048, which intersected 1.0 m grading 21.50 g/t Au and 5.9 m grading 2.45 g/t Au (including 2.1 m grading 6.30 g/t Au), GL-21-047, which intersected 21.4m grading 0.83 g/t, GL-21-034, which intersected 16.1 m grading 0.99 g/t Au (including 0.8m grading 10.00 g/t Au) and GL-21-029, which intersected 5.0 m grading 2.95 g/t Au (including 1.0m grading 8.78 g/t Au and 1.0 m grading 5.70 g/t Au), 5.0 m grading 0.62 g/t Au and 14.7m grading 0.46 g/t Au. Zone 4 is located approximately 80 metres to the Northwest of Zone 1, is parallel in strike to Zone 1 and sits outside of the current proposed PEA pits. Results from Zone 4 and Zone 8 are hosted within the Andesite and at Porphyry-Andesite contacts in the footwall of Zone 1 as outlined in Figure 2, adding to our geologic understanding of the Goldlund deposit.</p><p>Table 1: New Significant Intercepts from recent drilling //st Drill Hole Zone From (m) To (m) Sample Grade</p><p>Length (g/t</p><p>(m) Au) GL-21-029 4 31.00 36.00 5.00 2.95</p><p>including 31.00 32.00 1.00 8.78</p><p>and including 35.00 36.00 1.00 5.70 GL-21-029 4 109.40 124.10 14.70 0.46 GL-21-033 4 93.30 96.30 3.00 2.37</p><p>including 4 95.30 96.30 1.00 6.19 GL-21-034 4 77.05 93.15 16.10 0.99</p><p>including 89.50 90.30 0.80 10.00 GL-21-039 4 63.20 72.10 8.90 1.16</p><p>including 69.90 72.10 2.20 4.15 GL-21-045 8 137.60 148.60 11.00 1.02</p><p>including 147.60 148.60 1.00 4.90 GL-21-047 4 50.10 71.50 21.40 0.83</p><p>including 65.40 67.90 2.50 2.55 GL-21-048 4 128.00 129.00 1.00 21.50 GL-21-048 8 161.90 167.80 5.90 2.45</p><p>including 161.90 164.00 2.10 6.30 GL-21-050 6 6.00 6.70 0.70 27.70 GL-21-050 4 68.00 94.00 26.00 2.94</p><p>including 72.00 73.00 1.00 63.50</p><p>and including 93.00 94.00 1.00 8.08 GL-21-058 1 103.60 129.50 25.90 5.48</p><p>including 104.60 105.60 1.00 76.80</p><p>and including 109.60 111.50 1.90 14.95</p><p>and including 116.50 117.50 1.00 5.26</p><p>and including 123.50 128.50 5.00 2.95 GL-21-059 1 6.00 39.70 33.70 1.67</p><p>including 35.30 36.40 1.10 12.10 GL-21-061 1 133.00 147.00 14.00 2.83</p><p>including 133.00 137.00 4.00 6.35</p><p>including 133.00 134.00 1.00 12.30</p><p>and including 135.00 136.00 1.00 6.14</p><p>and including 139.00 140.00 1.00 5.58</p><p>and including 145.00 146.00 1.00 4.77 Note: Reported intervals are drilled core lengths and do not indicate true widths.

The holes targeting Zone 1 are located directly within the main Zone 1 pit as proposed in the PEA and give further evidence to confirm the mineralization at Goldlund over significant intervals related to the typical vein-hosted mineralization within Granodiorite.</p><p>QA / QC</p><p>The Company has implemented a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program to ensure sampling and analysis of all exploration work is conducted in accordance with the CIM Exploration Best Practices Guidelines. The drill core is sawn in half with one-half of the core sample dispatched to Activation Laboratories Ltd. facility located in Dryden, Ontario. The other half of the core is retained for future assay verification and/or metallurgical testing. Other QA/QC procedures include the insertion of blanks and Canadian Reference Standards for every tenth sample in the sample stream. A quarter core duplicate is assayed every 20th sample. The laboratory has its own QA/QC protocols running standards and blanks with duplicate samples in each batch stream. Additional checks are routinely run on anomalous values including gravimetric analysis and pulp metallic screen fire assays. Gold analysis is conducted by lead collection, fire assay with atomic absorption and/or gravimetric finish on a 50-gram sample. Check assays are conducted at a secondary ISO certified laboratory (in this case AGAT Laboratories located in Mississauga, Ontario) following the completion of a program.</p><p>Qualified Persons</p><p>Mark Wheeler, P.Eng., Director, Projects, and Adam Larsen, Exploration Manager, are both considered as a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), and have reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this news release on behalf of Treasury.</p><p>About Treasury Metals Inc.</p><p>Treasury Metals Inc. is a gold focused company with assets in Canada.

Eileen raised two children and when Nelson retired in 1975 she went to work with the Red Cross, assisting families in crisis. Eileen lived in many parts of Canada. She moved to Toronto in 1952 when her husband was transferred there by CBC. They later moved to Montreal in 1965 when Nelson was assigned to develop and operate the Expo 67 broadcast centre. In 1987 they moved to Calgary to be closer to family living in western Canada. After Nelson\u2019s death in 1996 she moved to Fruitvale in 2010 and finally the New Denver Pavilion in 2015.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eileen was an excellent basketball, baseball and tennis player in her youth. She stayed active most of her life and enjoyed swimming at \u201cY\u201d. Wherever she lived she volunteered, often with a library. While volunteering with CNIB she became accomplished at typing in Braille to create books for the blind. A visit with Eileen began with an off er of tea and a snack, followed by a conversation about family and then a discussion of current events. She enjoyed reading and always there was a book beside her chair.</p><p>Eileen is survived by her two children Bruce (Judi), Robert (Holly), four grandchildren Duncan (Misha), Heather (Yves), Jennifer (Tim), David (Kim), five great-grandchildren (Isabelle, Felix, Hugo, Ophelia, Felicity), her sister-in-law Joyce, seven nieces and their families.</p><p>She was predeceased by her parents Frank and Ethel Taylor, husband Nelson Gardiner, four siblings Katherine, Wilson, Eleanor, and Donald. The family would like to thank The Pavilion staff for their care for Eileen for the past five years. From the very beginning both the nursing and care staff made Eileen feel at home, treating her with warmth and dignity. In her later months and days we were particularly grateful for the care and compassion shown.</p><p>Donations in her name to Salvation Army or SPCA would be appreciated. An intermingling of ashes with her late husband will be at a family ceremony at Eden Brook Memorial Gardens in Calgary July 26, 2021.</p><p>To leave a personal message of condolence, please see the Thompson Funeral Service website <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thompsonfs.ca\">https://www.thompsonfs.ca</url>.</p><p>Eileen Frances Gardiner April 2, 1920 ~ June 20, 2021 WAGNER, Norman Leslie It is with great sadness that the family of Norman Leslie Wagner \u201cWag\u201d announce his sudden passing at his home in Balfour, BC at the age of 81 years.</p><p>Norman was born September 29, 1939 in Trail, BC to parents Fred and Helen Wagner. He had a brother Gordon and sisters, Carol and Janis. He received his schooling in Trail and graduated in the first grad class of J.L. Crowe High School. He attained an instrument mechanic ticket from Cominco and started to raise a family of 3 boys, Leslie, Mark and Grant. When the family split, Norman continued his education, getting a degree and teaching certification at UBC in Vancouver, later going on to earn his Masters in Education at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA.</p><p>Along the way, Norman met and married Reet Puusepp and they moved to Golden, BC where they build a wonderful log home, designed by Norman, on their acreage in the Blaeberry. Norman and Reet were both teachers at the Golden High School. Daughter Jill was born in 1976.</p><p>A man of many interests and experiences, in addition to farming and raising cattle (and St. Bernard dogs), Norm was a hell-ski guide. He took a year off teaching to develop the Kicking Horse Mountain Ski area. As a young man, he spent summers as a park warden on horseback and a forest fire fighter. Norm loved to ski, golf, hike, ATV, snowmobile and was a glider pilot. He also enjoyed hunting trips with his sons and grandsons. Norm was a member of the Gyros for several years.</p><p>In later years, Norman and Reet moved to Balfour, BC. After Reet\u2019s passing, Norman met Sylvia Berry. They enjoyed many years at their beautiful lake house where they welcomed family and their many friends. Norman was larger than life, a generous, strong loving family man with many interesting and funny stories to share. Sitting next to him at the dinner table could be tricky when telling a story with his hands flying.</p><p>Norman leaves behind his wife Sylvia; his sons:Les (Kelly), Mark (Frieda), Grant (Kristie) and his daughter Jill; his beloved grandchildren:Nicole, Calt, Ross, Sarina, Evan, Brayden, Jordyn, Norman and 2 great grandchildren; his sisters:Carol (Cliff ) and Janis, and numerous cousins, nephews, nieces and their children. He was predeceased by his parents, brother Gordon and by Reet.</p><p>Norm, we will all miss you dearly and \u201cHello That There Place\u201d will be an echo whenever we answer the phone. We will keep on telling your stories and, as you told your granddaughter on her birthday last week, we will have a glass of wine for you.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, remembrance may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation.</p><p>Interment with family attending:Rossland-Trail Mountain View Cemetery.

Mom passed as she lived; with dignity, grace and entirely on her own terms. Her two sons, Michael and Paul remained at her side as she made her final journey to be with her husband of 73 years, our father Robert Moff at, who pre deceased Mom in 2016.</p><p>Born in Victoria BC in 1923, Mom was more comfortable in pants than a dress and could outrun both boys and girls her age with ease. She maintained her speed and strength well into her adult life as her sons can well attest.</p><p>A woman who radiated power and authority, seemingly inconsistent within her quiet demeanor and diminutive stature:She was rich in humanity and generous of spirit. Mom was one of the strongest women we have known. She derived great pride in her accomplishment of achieving the \u2018Worthy Grand Matron\u2019 status from the lodge of the Eastern Star but that pride paled compared to her pride of her family. Mom is survived by two sons, four grand children, six great grand children and one great great grandchild.</p><p>Nothing could bring her power and authority to a more strident outcome than a perceived threat to her family. Like a beautiful kestrel hovering below the clouds she could be called down from the blue, unsheathe her verbal talons and rend an embarrassed apology from the na\u00efve off ender. Rarely was the indiscretion repeated.</p><p>We were primal clay before a giant who breathed life and pride into her family. At times cracked and flawed, we, her children, are all that we are because of who she was. We have wept at her loss, reflected on her gifts and remembered. We will always remember.</p><p>To leave a personal message of condolence, please see the Thompson Funeral Service website <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thompsonfs.ca\">https://www.thompsonfs.ca</url>.</p><p>Roberta \u2018Betty\u2019 Moff at (1923 ~ 2021)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20210722PRAA0002023990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636G-D5W1-F0HF-83CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Social media users shared footage showing plumes of smoke visible from a distance, raising alarm about potential risks to nearby communities.  Was there a forest fire in Setia Alam?  Verdict:  TRUE  A forest fire covering approximately 1.2 hectares near the route from Setia Alam Toll to Meru was fully extinguished at around 7pm on Tuesday (Oct 14).  Selangor Fire and Rescue Department Operations Division Assistant Director Ahmad Mukhlis Mukhtar said his department received an emergency call regarding the incident at 4.54pm.  He said a team of seven personnel from Klang Utara Fire and Rescue Station (BBP) along with an FRT vehicle were dispatched to the scene, which was located approximately 12km from the station.  \"The fire involved a forested area on a hill with an estimated area of three acres (1.2 hectares) at a height of around 300m,\" he told Sinar Harian on Wednesday (Oct 15).  He explained that the fire brigade team arrived at the location at 5.07pm and carried out firefighting operations before the blaze was brought under control at 6.10pm the same day.  He said the fire was fully extinguished at 7pm and no casualties were reported, whilst the cause of the fire remains under investigation.  Earlier, the forest fire incident went viral on Facebook when several social media users shared video recordings of thick smoke visible from afar around the Setia Alam area.  The incident also triggered public concern about the risk of the fire spreading to nearby areas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-57935540049</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H02-S563-RS7J-D0W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"315\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 15, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

It will be remembered Mike walked away with a pig from the C.P.R. and afterwards escaped from custody. Mike was handed three months for each offence. Constable Collins escorted Mike to his new home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Salary reduction proposed \u2026 On January 25th the school trustees held a meeting at which it was decided to ask the teachers receiving a salary of $100 and upwards to accept a reduction of 10 per cent and that teachers receiving a salary under $100 to accept a reduction of $5.00 per month each.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trustees met the teachers and laid this proposition before them and on the 26th of January the following reply was received: I am instructed to inform you that at a meeting of teachers held at the public school this morning the question of signing the proposed reduction of salaries was put to the ballot which resulted in favor of not signing by 12 votes to 2. I am, dear sir, yours truly, H. C. Gerrard, Principal.</p><p>Runaways \u2026 One of the delivery teams of the Cranbrook Trading Co. made a spirited dash up Baker Street on Wednesday afternoon without a driver, stopping in front of Worden's Transfer office. Mr. Worden in endeavoring to extricate one horses head from an entanglement of harness had one of his fingers severely bitten, which necessitated a doctor's attention.</p><p>Could have been much worse \u2026 T. M. Edmondson was the victim of what might easily have been a fatal accident on Friday afternoon. While at work around his windmill, and in the act of carrying a long length of iron pipe a section of the pipe fell, striking him on the right side of the face just below the eye opening a deep wound the size of a half dollar.</p><p>To still further aggravate matters Mrs. Edmondson was out calling, but fortunately Mr. Payne happened to have occasion to call at the Edmondson home not long after the mishap, and after rendering first aid called Dr. Henderson, who dressed the wound.</p><p>The doctor accompanied Mr. Edmondson to Cranbrook hospital on Saturday from which institution he returned early in the week and is making satisfactory recovery.</p><p>Another recruitment \u2026 It is expected recruiting for the third Canadian contingent will commence shortly in Cranbrook. Military men say there will be no difficulty experienced in enrolling the necessary number from here.</p><p>A large number of men have already signified their intention of making application for the third call.</p><p>It is felt that Cranbrook can furnish a hundred men in ten days' notice.</p><p>Basketball \u2026 All roads led to the Young Men's Club on Monday night when the first game of the newly organized basketball league was played before a packed house. Arrangements had been made for a special night in order to create interest in the Club and the result exceeded all expectations.</p><p>Early in the evening the crowd began to gather and by the time the first event of the evening, the girls' game, commenced the overflow crowd necessitated the placing of seats on the basketball floor.</p><p>The girl's game was on a par with the program for the rest of the evening. The \"Hicks\" and \"Macs\" were the opposing teams and their playing time and time again awoke the enthusiastic outbursts from the audience. The play was fast and furious and at half time only one point separated the rivals the \"Hicks\" leading 4-3. The same quality was shown through the second half and when the whistle blew the tired \"Macs\" led the equally tired \"Hicks\" by one point the final score being 9-8.</p><p>The girls showed skill at the game that surprised the onlookers, many of the goals scored being shots of a sensational nature.</p><p>Mr. Mirams as referee made a hit with the girls by his impartial handling of the contest.</p><p>King Edward School entertainment \u2026 Cranbrook is noted for the success of local talent entertainments, there being a large amount of first-class histrionic talent in the city.</p><p>Last year one of the most notable events in this line was the combined program furnished by the pupils of the King Edward School and Miss Rumsey, dancing teacher. The youngsters on this occasion more than delighted a large audience.</p><p>This year a complete new repertoire of dances has been prepared by Miss Rumsey and the following youngsters will be seen in this part of the program: Misses Patricia McDermot, Ethel Atchison, Doris Wallinger, Muriel Wallinger, Lillian Jackson, Hazel Jackson, Rachel Madden, Kathleen Nisbet, Norma Wallinger, Elsie Beattie, Jean Corsan, Maisie Small, Phyllis Small, Hester Thompson, Betty Green, Alice Frassen and Alex. Nisbet, Kenneth Campbell, David Mecredy and Harvey Dixon.</p><p>Miss Patricia McDermot will also be seen in solo dancing.</p><p>Meet Mr. Green \u2026 About a dozen members of the local Board of Trade were on the station platform last Saturday afternoon to meet Mr. R. P. Green, member for this district in the Dominion parliament and lay before him matters of importance to this district. Mr. Green promised to give the various matters his attention and lay them before the government, but he was very conservative in promising that anything would be done.</p><p>Masonic dance \u2026 The Masonic Social Club held their opening dance at the Masonic Temple on Thursday evening, January 28th, when between thirty and forty couples danced from nine till twelve. The floor, as usual, was in fine shape and everyone had to pay attention to dancing, all the time, in order to keep their feet where they belonged.</p><p>From the fact that the majority of those present wanted a few more dances when twelve o'clock arrived and besieged the committee toward that end, it was plainly seen that everyone had one of the most enjoyable evenings of the season.</p><p>Luncheon was served by the ladies at 10:30 in the sitting rooms upstairs after which dancing was resumed with renewed vigor.</p><p>Miss Collings, who is famous for her ability to make good things, gave the lemon punch her personal attention, and from the praise on everyone's lips, she did not fail to live up to her reputation in this instance.</p><p>It was so good in fact, that several insisted that the coffee, with refreshments, could be dispensed with in the future, and the lemon punch instituted in its stead. Miss Collings has stated emphatically that there was no \"stick in it\", and a Mason never tells.</p><p>All kinds of dances were indulged in, including most of the latest dances, such as the one-step. A good many of the older folks who were not able to dance the one-step were, naturally, not so enthusiastic about it as were the younger set. However, several of the older set announced their intention of immediately learning this pretty and popular dance.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the fact that the club is to have all the up-to-date dances will draw the young people of the city and those from out-of-town as well.</p><p>The programme was arranged with a view to suiting everybody, young and old, so that the principal object of the club, namely, \"The promotion of social intercourse\", might be attained.</p><p>A feature of the evening was the \"Circle Two Step\", as handled by Mr. Norman Gardner, and it seemed as if the dancers could not be tired of it. No doubt Mr. Gardner's winning way of handling this popular dance was largely responsible for this state of affairs.</p><p>Everyone was having such an enjoyable time, when Mr. James Martin, the floor manager, announced the \"Home Sweet Home\" that a look of disappointment came to every face. However, this was overcome when they were reminded that the club would hold two dances during February, two in March and two in April.</p><p>The success of their opening dance augurs well for their future dances.</p><p>Music was furnished by the Kootenay Orchestra to the entire satisfaction of all.</p><p>Women's Institute \u2026 The regular monthly meeting of the Women's Institute took place on Tuesday afternoon at the Maple Hall, presided over by Mrs. W. B. McFarlane. A very large and enthusiastic body of members and visitors were assembled to enjoy a highly interesting and varied program prepared for the day.</p><p>Proceedings opened with the singing of the Maple Leaf, followed by the minutes of the January meeting being read and approved and disposal of other business.</p><p>The social part commenced with an excellent solo contributed by Mrs. E. D. Ireland. Mrs. H. H. McClure was then called upon to give a paper on \"How Women May Become Self-Supporting in Rural Districts\", which appears elsewhere in this issue. This subject was given at the convention at Nelson by Mrs. McClure, who was a delegate from the local Women's Institute, and her apt and able manner of treating it prompted the directorate to invite her to repeat the subject for the benefit of the members, who thoroughly appreciated it.</p><p>At the conclusion of her remarks Mrs. McFarlane suggested the paper should be printed in the local press, the matter being a weighty one with women generally.</p><p>Milk depot \u2026 The Farmers' Institute, through the kindness of Mayor Bowness will hold their February meeting in the city hall on Saturday, the 13th instant at 2:00 p.m. The chief subject for discussion is the proposed milk depot for the city.</p><p>At present several milk wagons are covering practically the same ground in their daily rounds. Why not have all milk delivered at a central depot and two wagons would cover the city.</p><p>This would solve a labor proposition on the farm and however small the herd kept, there would always be a market for the produce. Surplus milk could be separated and cream, butter or ice cream handled in the summer.</p><p>An egg circle in connection would add to the usefulness of the depot.</p><p>Messrs. W. J. Atchison, J. A. Pringle and W. B. Bardgett will speak on the dairymen's side and R. T. Williams of the Reliable Egg Farm will give a paper on the Egg Circle.</p><p>All dairy and poultrymen are specially invited.</p><p>The secretary has information on government seed grain, register for members to show stock and produce handled, pruning school and short courses. Remember the date, Saturday, February 13th, at the city hall.</p><p>Creston news \u2026 The limit for light passenger traffic westbound was recorded on Tuesday when there was only one person aboard going through to Nelson. Things were better on Wednesday when nine prisoners of war \u2014 Austrians \u2014 were on, bound for Vernon. They were from Fernie, Elko and Cranbrook.</p><p>Dance at St. Mary's Hall \u2026 There will be another dance held at St. Mary's hall on the 10th of February, and as this will be the last one held in this hall before Lent, it is hoped that a good attendance will result, particularly as it is given by request, the last one being so enjoyable.</p><p>The Cranbrook orchestra is supplying the music, which is a sufficient guarantee, and the floor, being one of the best in Cranbrook.</p><p>There is no reason why the dance should not be one of the most successful ever held in this city.</p><p>Refreshments will be served and without extra charge. Don't forget the time, the date and the place\u2014St. Mary's Hall, February 10th.</p><p>New place of business \u2026 Little &amp; Atchison's new store is spick and span and the new quarters have been most conveniently arranged with new fixtures throughout and bright, new linoleum on the floor, presenting the appearance of neatness and cleanliness.</p><p>It is often said that a grocer's life is a monotonous, humdrum sort of existence, but there are a good many grocery stores that keep out of the usual rut of daily routine, always alive to something new in their business and always making their store more attractive for customers and more handy for dispensing goods over the counters.</p><p>It would seem that Little &amp; Atchison have about reached the acme of perfection on these little up-to-date points that attract the careful purchaser and the housewife who insists on only the cleanest sort of goods.</p><p>There is an old adage that a man must eat a peck of dirt before he dies but he would have to live a long time before he ate it on his groceries purchased at this store.</p><p>The display windows at the new store on Baker Street are full of daily hints to household buyers and with the advent of cash only and a wholesale lowering of prices in accordance with the new program Little &amp; Atchison bid fair to increase their already large trade and provide their regular customers with the staple goods of high class standard at a considerable less cost than formerly.</p><p>Creston news \u2026 While sledding on the Fourth street hill on Wednesday afternoon \"Roy\" (Ross) Barton, the six-year-old son of Mrs. J. M. Barton, had the bad luck to lose control of the steering apparatus and was landed up against a barb wire fence, when near the foot of the hill. His left cheek and nose suffered, the cut on the cheek requiring Dr. Henderson's attention. Several stitches were necessary in dressing the injured cheek.</p><p>Fernie news \u2026 Wm. Robichaud and Billy Ross are considering the erection of a roller skating rink and dance hall on Victoria avenue just south of W. A. Ingram's residence.

It will be one story in height with provision for exaltation if circumstances warrant. There will be dressing rooms and every provision for the comfort and convenience of patrons.</p><p>Cranbrook men win first aid medals \u2026 J. Bennett. W. Gibbs and J. Lower this week received St. John Ambulance medals for proficiency in their work. All three men are connected with the C.P.R.</p><p>In most places when a man wins the St. John Ambulance medal it is generally presented to the winner at some public meeting and is looked upon as being an event of great significance. However, these gentlemen received their medals this week and no one but a few intimate friends of the boys know anything of the affair. The boys, however, are none the less proud of their prizes.</p><p>Drs. King and Green, who instructed the boys in their studies, are proud of the showing made by the home lads and are to be congratulated on the success of their students.</p><p>Soldiers will give regimantal dance \u2026 Fourth Dance Will be Held in the Auditorium on February 15th.

Flaming posters are posted around the town and are attracting the crowds, like a forest fire. A good live Board of Trade means capital to every property owner in the town, and every owner should be on hand, and help elect a good live bunch, and give them a good shove along, not hang back and grouch like a treed lynx. Mrs. N. E. Suddaby, of Fernie, came down to Elko Saturday and organized a chapter of the daughters of the empire. The grace and beauty of the old historic burg turned out en masse. The meeting was held in Mrs. E. B. Holbrook's parlors, post office block, kindly lent for the occasion. The meeting opened and Mrs. Suddaby in a neat and crisp speech and explained the object of the chapter in all the colors of the good old Union Jack, which was well received and appreciated by all present. The name of the Chapter is Elk Canyon, the motto is \"In unity there is strength\". The following officers were elected for the first term: Mrs. Richard Hirtz, Regent; Mrs. Holbrook, first vice regent; Mrs. Roberts, second vice regent; Miss Inez Holbrook, secretary; Miss Irene McKee, treasurer; Miss Belle Thomson, standard bearer. Tea and cake were served and a good social time was spent and. a hearty vote of thanks was tendered Mrs. Suddaby, who replied in a snappy little briney speech that crackled and turned up at the edges. We wish the Daughters of the only Empire fit to live and have our being in every success, and then some.</p><p>Elko star hockey team \u2026 About fifty rooters accompanied the Elko Star Hockey team down to Waldo on Sunday to play the Waldo team which met on the Baker rink. Several hundred spectators had assembled to watch the rival teams play. At 3 o'clock, Great Northern time, the battle commenced and if they had had Ross rifles instead of Hockey sticks the battle of Ypres would have looked like a snow ball fight alongside of it. After nearly two hours of playing the score stood 2-2 and both teams would have played until they had made the additional score, had it not been for the Waldo goalkeeper getting seriously injured and on this account the game was called for some future date. The Waldo boys are good sports and were quite satisfied with the honors being even. The Elko boys were proud to see such a large crowd drive down to witness the game, and hope that the Waldo people will do the same when the return match takes place Another feature of the game was that it was clean all the way through, only one man being put on the fence and that was because the referee seen him. So everybody get a move on and boost for the return game.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Cranbrook Townsman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANDT-news20220204GCAGG4277634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRANDT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64PJ-V011-JD2C-J3MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2998\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

More than 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate to escape the flames.</p><p>\"What's happening in Australia now is extraordinary,\" said Ed Struzik, a fellow at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen's University.</p><p>And he says, Canada is not immune to seeing the same thing.</p><p>\"We're as vulnerable as any country in the world,\" he said.</p><p>Canada is home to about 30 per cent of the world's total forests, and 10 per cent of what is known as forest cover, which refers to a specific density of trees.</p><p>According to the National Forestry Database, Canada's worst year for forest fires burned about seven million hectares in 1995, while the average yearly amount burned is about 2.3 million hectares.</p><p>The Fort McMurray, Alta., fire in 2016, burned 590,000 hectares, destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings and forced the entire city of more than 80,000 people to evacuate.</p><p>British Columbia declared a state of emergency in both 2017 and 2018, when they had two record setting years for fires. In 2017, 1.22 million hectares burned in B.C. and in 2018, 1.35 million hectares burned.</p><p>Struzik says fire risk is going up in Canada because of climate change, human activity and a glut of fuel for fires in forests ravaged by pests like the mountain pine beetle.</p><p>\"We're seeing things that we just haven't really seen before,\" he said. \"So the signals are there. Very strong signals that we're going to see things get a lot worse before they get better.\"</p><p>University of Alberta wildland fire professor Mike Flannigan says \"climate change's fingerprints are all over these Australian fires\" and play the same role in raising the risk in Canada.</p><p>\"The warmer it is the longer the fire season,\" said Flannigan. \"The warmer it is the more lightning you see.\"</p><p>He said for every degree of warming, the number of lightning strikes goes up by about 12 per cent. Lightning usually causes more than half of the wildfires in Canada.</p><p>He also said warmer temperatures dry out trees and other fuels for the fire. Unless there is an associated increase in rainfall, there is more fuel available to burn, allowing fires to start easily and spread more rapidly. They are also more intense fires, making them harder, or even impossible, to extinguish.</p><p>VIDEO: How to help the animals affected by Australia's wildfires</p><p>\"It's a warmer world and part of a warmer world is more fire,\" he said.</p><p>Canada, like Australia and California among others, is also seeing an increase in the number of fires burning closer to where people live and in places where they didn't usually burn before. That is partly because communities are growing out into areas that used to be very unpopulated, but also because people are playing and enjoying the natural environments in places they did not visit much in earlier times.</p><p>Humans cause between one-third and one-half of the fires in Canada each year, said Struzik.</p><p>Both Struzik and Flannigan say Canada needs to invest in more research to work on fire prediction, prevention and monitoring in particular. Struzik said some of the tools being used now were developed 70 years ago.</p><p>Flannigan said fire research budgets have been cut to the bone over the last 20 years or so, but he said he thinks recent investments are now turning that ship around.</p><p>Better emergency-management plans and systems at the community level are also desperately needed, say Struzik and Flannigan. The 2019 federal budget set aside $151 million over five years to improve emergency management and some of that money is going to research, said Flannigan.</p><p>Individuals who live in cities far from canopied forests are more likely to be affected by smoke and should invest in air purifiers, said Flannigan. Those who live near bigger forests should reduce the risk by removing fuel like shrubbery and mulch around their homes, and not use wood shingles. They also need an evacuation plan.</p><p>Remote communities that have limited ways in or out should have fire-safe shelters built, they say.</p><p>\"Bottom line for Canadians is climate change is here,\" said Flannigan. \"We're going to see a lot more. Not every year, but on average we're going to see a lot more fire, a lot more smoke. We have to learn to live with fire.\"</p><p>Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press</p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-3930256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-NFT1-JDH1-C53T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abbotsford News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001941</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009P2F</classCode><className>TEACHER LAYOFFS &amp; DISMISSALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000619</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000619</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITY POLICY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
