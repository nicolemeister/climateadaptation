Hornick.'<br/><br/> Heavy workloads and low recognition are causing unrest within the guild.<br/><br/> WHAT ARE THE FIREFIGHTERS' MAIN CONCERNS?<br/><br/> There are many concerns at this time from the firefighters. However, personnel retention is a significant challenge.<br/><br/> \"We were having trouble keeping people because the money is not enough. You can make more money almost anywhere,\" said Freedman. \"Thirty years ago, you had a crew of four people, and each person on the crew had at least 20 years of experience.\"<br/><br/> Economic incentives are not good enough to retain the most experienced personnel, who are essential to guiding new staff.<br/><br/> \"Your average fire crew today has less than eight years of experience. We are sending young people under the age of 25, with maybe five years of experience, to lead fire crews into brand new fires in the middle of nowhere,\" he said. \"These young firefighters are tasked with fighting fires and doing it safely. It is a life-and-death situation.\"<br/><br/> MNRF spokesperson Marcela Mayo said the ministry is working to promote retention.<br/><br/> \"Like many other employers across the province, MNRF has positions that are being impacted by a highly competitive labour market and economic factors,\" she said. \"Although wildland firefighter positions are often seasonal or fixed term, with natural attrition occurring as the fire season winds down, the ministry has hired a consultant to collaborate with Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services on short and long-term strategies to improve recruitment and retention.\"<br/><br/> The other concern lies in the budget.<br/><br/> The ministry has increased its Emergency Fire Fighting funding by more than 92 per cent since 2018, Mayo said.<br/><br/> Freedman said that increase is not always enough.<br/><br/> \"If fires must be fought in an emergency, the government will always spend more money. The problem is that our actual budget is so low that it is impossible to buy things very quickly,\" he said. \"Because most of our budget only becomes available when fires start, we can't buy the necessary equipment and infrastructure that we need before we need it.\"<br/><br/> WHAT ARE THE REQUESTS TO THE MINISTRY?<br/><br/> The first request is about standby time.<br/><br/> \"We are supposed to be entitled to stand by time, which means that when we're not actively fighting the fire, we're supposed to get paid,\" said Freedman. \" Sometimes, we are not actively fighting a fire, but we are sleeping in a tent in the forest, getting eaten by bugs and away from family or friends, but not getting paid.\"<br/><br/> The second request is about job titles.<br/><br/> \"My official job title is 'resource technician three', even though I'm a fire crew leader,\" he said. \"All we ask is to give the green light to approve the reclassification of your job codes.\"<br/><br/> Freedman said the reclassification of the titles will allow a more accurate payment.<br/><br/> Despite the problems, Mayo said the ministry committed to working with OPSEU to review concerns. In addition, she says the ministry's efforts are reflected locally.<br/><br/> \"As of August 30, the Parry Sound District has seen a total of 11 fires. There have been no fires of note, with none of the 11 fires exceeding six hectares in size. There hasn't been a fire in the district since late June,\" she said. \"This is a testament to the hard work and efforts done by our wildland firefighters, operations staff, pilots and aviation maintenance engineers, and everyone that has contributed to these efforts.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023090168924908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6932-3591-JDV5-F09M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

However, personnel retention is a significant challenge.<br/><br/> \"We were having trouble keeping people because the money is not enough. You can make more money almost anywhere,\" said Freedman. \"Thirty years ago, you had a crew of four people, and each person on the crew had at least 20 years of experience.\"<br/><br/> Economic incentives are not good enough to retain the most experienced personnel, who are essential to guiding new staff.<br/><br/> \"Your average fire crew today has less than eight years of experience.

The department was on site until 1 a.m. and returned the next day. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de protection des for\u00eats contre le feu (SOPFEU) stayed through the night, monitoring the situation and tending to a hotspot Sunday morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Johnson, the fire came about a month earlier than the department would normally expect.  </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important to be careful. It\u2019s dry everywhere,\u201d he said.  </p><p>The fire spanned about two hectares of deciduous forest behind the three chapels of the Calvaire d\u2019Oka, but it mostly spread on the floor of the area. All but two large trees that were felled are expected to survive, according to Johnson.  </p><p>The March fire comes on the heels of a year largely defined by forest fires in the province, with unusually dry conditions creating fertile ground for fires that devastated communities in 2023 and poured smoke across the Montreal region and the Laurentians.  </p><p>\u201cObviously, like everyone, we are crossing our fingers that last year's scenario does not happen again this summer,\u201d said Simon Boivin, spokesperson for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements de plein air du Qu\u00e9bec (S\u00e9paq), which operates Oka Park.  </p><p>\u201cOn the S\u00e9paq side, we remain vigilant to ensure compliance in our establishments with the instructions prohibiting open fires when issued by SOPFEU,\u201d he said, adding that the parks make an effort to educate visitors on fire safety.  </p><p>To Kanehsata\u2019kehr\u00f3:non Kane Montour, a member of Kanesatake\u2019s Perimeter Security Team, the incident was concerning.  </p><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s not in the heart of Kanesatake, it\u2019s still our land,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Montour, who helped put out a small fire in the Pines in November, believes the fire is a reminder that Kanehsata\u2019kehr\u00f3:non need to pay attention to fire safety guidelines on the territory. He said there have been instances of youth sparking fires in the Pines or community members making campfires that they fail to extinguish properly.  </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just carelessness. You shouldn\u2019t be burning in the Pines anyways,\u201d he said.  </p><p>\u201cAs traditional people, we have a relationship with the animals and the forests. It\u2019s our home.

We are extremely thankful to the government of Quebec and firefighters for their hard work in controlling the wildfires in the region. There has been no damage to any of Wallbridges assets and we dont expect any impact on the Companys ability to complete its 2023 exploration program.</p><p>On June 5, Wallbridge advised investors of the temporary suspension of operations. Two drills are now fully operational. During the period of the temporary shutdown, Wallbridge has continued work on its projects by evaluating historic drill results, assessing geophysics results, working on the PEA report, and strategizing the exploration activities at the targets identified on its Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend.</p><p>The Company will continue to monitor wildfire development in the region and respond proactively and accordingly should the situation change.</p><p>About Wallbridge Mining</p><p>Wallbridge is focused on creating value through the exploration and sustainable development of gold projects along the Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend while respecting the environment and communities where it operates.</p><p>Wallbridges flagship project, Fenelon Gold (Fenelon), is located on the highly prospective Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend Property in Qubecs Northern Abitibi region. An updated mineral resource estimate completed in January 2023 yielded significantly improved grades and additional ounces at the 100%-owned Fenelon and Martiniere projects, incorporating a combined 3.05 million ounces of indicated gold resources and 2.35 million ounces of inferred gold resources. Fenelon and Martiniere are located within an 830 km2 exploration land package controlled by Wallbridge. In addition, Wallbridge believes that the extensive land package is extremely prospective for the discovery of additional gold deposits.</p><p>Wallbridge has reported a positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on its 100%- owned Fenelon gold Project with an estimated average annual gold production of 212,000 ounces over 12.3 years.</p><p>Wallbridge also holds a 19.9% interest in the common shares of Archer Exploration Corp. (Archer) as a result of the sale of the Companys portfolio of nickel assets in Ontario and Qubec in November of 2022.</p><p>Wallbridge will continue to focus on its core Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend Property while enabling shareholders to participate in the potential economic upside in Archer.</p><p>For further information please visit the Companys website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wallbridgemining.com\">www.wallbridgemining.com</url> or contact:</p><p>Wallbridge Mining Company Limited</p><p>Marz Kord, P.

Generally, FLI can be identified by the use of statements that include words such as seeks, believes, anticipates, plans, continues, budget, scheduled, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, projects, predicts, proposes, \"potential\", targets and variations of such words and phrases, or by statements that certain actions, events or results may, will, could, would, should or might, be taken, occur or be achieved.</p><p>FLI herein may include, but is not limited to, statements regarding the results of the Fenelon preliminary economic assessment (PEA), statements regarding the potential future performance of Archer common shares; future drill results; the Companys ability to convert inferred resources into measured and indicated resources; environmental matters; stakeholder engagement and relationships; parameters and methods used to estimate mineral resource estimates (the MREs) at the Fenelon Gold and Martiniere properties (collectively the Deposits); the prospects, if any, of the Deposits; future drilling at the Deposits; and the significance of historic exploration activities and results. FLI is not, and cannot be, a guarantee of future results or events.</p><p>FLI is designed to help you understand managements current views of its near- and longer-term prospects, and it may not be appropriate for other purposes. FLI by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such FLI. Although FLI is based upon what management believes, or believed at the time, to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure shareholders and prospective purchasers of securities of the Company that actual results will be consistent with such FLI, as there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any such FLI. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake, and assumes no obligation, to update or revise any such FLI contained herein to reflect new events or circumstances, except as may be required by law. Unless otherwise noted, this press release has been prepared based on information available as of the date of this press release. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the FLI or information contained herein.</p><p>Assumptions upon which FLI is based, without limitation, include the results of exploration activities, the Companys financial position and general economic conditions; the ability of exploration activities to accurately predict mineralization; the accuracy of geological modelling; the ability of the Company to complete further exploration activities; potential changes in project parameters or economic assessments; the legitimacy of title and property interests; the accuracy of key assumptions, parameters or methods used to estimate the MREs and in the PEA; the ability of the Company to obtain required approvals; geological, mining and exploration technical problems; failure of equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; the evolution of the global economic climate; metal prices; foreign exchange rates; environmental expectations; community and non-governmental actions; any impacts of COVID-19; and, the Companys ability to secure required funding. Risks and uncertainties about Wallbridge's business are more fully discussed in the disclosure materials filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, which are available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>. Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in FLI.</p><p>Cautionary Note to United States Investors</p><p>Wallbridge Mining prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Terms relating to mineral resources in this press release are defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Council on May 19, 2014, as amended (\"CIM Standards\"). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments effective February 25, 2019 (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC will now recognize estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", which are defined in substantially similar terms to the corresponding CIM Standards. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Standards.</p><p>U.S. investors are cautioned that while the foregoing terms are \"substantially similar\" to corresponding definitions under the CIM Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that Wallbridge Mining may report as \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had Wallbridge Mining prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances were permitted under NI 43-101.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

Climate change means that temperatures will keep rising, and the dry years will be drier.</p><p>Plus, in a country as big as Canada, we are likely to see at least one region suffering a bad forest fire season every year, and in some years \u2013 like this one \u2013 it\u2019ll be awful coast to coast.</p><p>A national forest firefighting service would have to be well staffed, well equipped, and mobile.

Smoke is blanketing large parts of the country. It\u2019s the worst spring wildfire season Canada has ever seen.</p><p>Across the country, provincial firefighting services rely on a mixture of local recruits, municipal firefighters, aid from overseas, and the Canadian Armed Forces.</p><p>We need a national response, and probably a national forest firefighting service.</p><p>Unfortunately, things aren\u2019t going to get better. Climate change means that temperatures will keep rising, and even when we get a damp year or two, the dry years will be drier, and more prone to fire.</p><p>Plus, in a country as big as Canada, we are likely to see at least one region suffering a bad forest fire season every year, and in some years \u2013 like this one \u2013it\u2019ll be awful coast to coast.</p><p>A national forest firefighting service would have to be well staffed, well equipped, and mobile. It would need to be able to respond quickly to any region of the country, to supplement local efforts and to bring its own expertise.</p><p>Because it would serve the entire country, it wouldn\u2019t be an undue tax burden on any one province.</p><p>It could also potentially afford to buy and maintain more specialized equipment, like large, new water bombers.</p><p>The natural instinct in politics is to pass the buck, and firefighting has long been provincial jurisdiction.</p><p>But fires don\u2019t respect borders, including provincial borders. As they get worse, we\u2019ll need to reconsider how we fight them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-news20230616PQJA0003659778</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GG-4V11-JD2C-J4RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"284\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

It also means an increase in climate-sensitive infectious diseases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified climate change as one of the biggest threats to global health. Over the past ten years, we have seen the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases around the world. Scientific research in Canada and globally indicates that climate change iscontributing to the increased geographic spread, range and prevalence of certain zoonotic (diseases that can be transmitted between animals and insects or bugs to humans), food-borne and water-borne infectious diseases. All these types of diseases could cause negative health outcomes, with vulnerable populations at greater risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is why today, the Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health, announced six new projects totalling $2.7 million over three years, to help address and adapt to the impacts of climate change to health. These projects will increase monitoring efforts and improve overall awareness and understanding of climate-sensitive infectious diseases in Canada.</p><p>The Government of Canada is working with partners and stakeholders, such as the provinces and territories, health professionals, communities, as well as First Nation, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis groups to adapt to our changing climate. The Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) Infectious Diseases and Climate Change Fund, which is part of the Infectious Disease and Climate Change Program, supports work across the country with an aim to increase access to science, expertise, education and awareness. Until 2028, this Fund will invest up to $2 million each year to help people in Canada better adapt and become more resilient to our changing climate.</p><p>These new projects with the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing, Toronto Metropolitan University, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, University of Guelph and the University of Ottawa will:</p><p> Build baseline data, enhance monitoring, and increase our understanding of new or emerging tick-borne and mosquito-borne diseases;Increase health professional capacity through the development of public health tools, training and better resources;Improve our understanding of where various infectious diseases are coming from, the impact from climate change and how it will affect the health of Canadians so that we can better predict and prevent illness; andBegin to address gaps to better protect at-risk populations, equip and empower the next generation of public health professionals, leverage citizen science approaches and advance One Health to build community resilience to climate change.</p><p>Climate change is a multi-faceted threat that will require coordination and collaboration across all sectors to address. Our government will continue to make important investments like these to ensure that the federal government plays its part in combatting climate change while also building our capacity to confront and mitigate its effects.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"Every year, Canadians are reminded of the impacts climate change has on our health. This summer, major cities were blanketed in hazardous smog from the worst forest fire season in Canadian history. Unfortunately, climate change is also having an impact on infectious diseases. Just like we have begun to adapt to more damaging forest fire seasons, we also need to prepare for emerging threats from infectious diseases. Through projects like those announced today, all levels of government, universities, health professional organizations and communities can work together to better predict and monitor the risks of these infectious diseases and empower people in Canada to adapt and make informed decisions, improving health outcomes for everyone.\"</p><p>The Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health </p><p>\"Climate change impacts on our health are complex and cascading. Itdoes not impact everyone in the same way which can increase the potential for negative health impacts at individual, community and population levels. These new projects will give people in Canada more tools and information so that they can make informed decisions to protect their health, take action to address challenges and create meaningful solutions where they live, work and play.\"</p><p>Dr. Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health OfficerPublic Health Agency of Canada </p><p> Quick FactsBuild baseline data, enhance monitoring, and increase our understanding of new or emerging tick-borne and mosquito-borne diseases;Increase health professional capacity through the development of public health tools, training and better resources;Improve our understanding of where various infectious diseases are coming from, the impact from climate change and how it will affect the health of Canadians so that we can better predict and prevent illness;

Each year, when the sun finally comes out and feels warm on the skin, there's a noticeable shift of energy on the island. People awaken with smiles, greet each other on the street and we all start coming out of hibernation to salute the sun.</p><p>Do you remember my first article in the fall? Scientists have shown just 17 minutes a day in nature is beneficial for the mind and body! Getting outside is one of the best wellness practices you can indulge in this spring. Though March is still a little bit cold and slightly too early to start planting in the gardens, you know we'll all be out there anyhow, prepping the beds, digging in the dirt and soaking up any minute the sun is out.</p><p>For those without a green thumb, there are many other options for spending more time outdoors. For the adventurous type, hiking trails become more accessible as the snow melts and wandering through the forest observing the subtle changes in spring is the perfect way to ground yourself and welcome the new season. There are dozens of local hiking groups on Facebook, as well as the All Trails app to help you find new places to explore.</p><p>Another way I like to celebrate spring is enjoying campfires. It's always disappointing when the forest fire seasons starts (earlier and earlier each year), so enjoying the warmth of a fire while it's safe to do so is a great option. You can invite some friends and reconnect after a long season of hibernation. Plus, you can bring some food outdoors to roast on the fire or pack a picnic to go enjoy with a nice view.</p><p>As we shift into a more active season, maybe you take some time to set some new intentions. You could take a few moments to meditate in the sun or simply reflect on your life and any new habits you'd like to adopt this season. This is a great time of year to try something new \u2013 tackle something on that bucket list of yours. Doing new things is a fantastic way to manifest good energy and feel alive.</p><p>For those of you who enjoy practicing yoga or finding more spiritual ways of connecting with nature, you could indulge in some 'Sun Salutations' in a comfortable place outside. The 'Sun Salutation' is a series of yoga poses that bring countless benefits to the mind and body. It improves circulation, rate of respiration, balances the endocrine systems and strengthens the joints and bones. Personally, I like starting the day with a couple of 'Sun Salutations' in the spring, looking out onto my lawn and I get to notice the subtle changes of the sun's light as we get closer to the solstice. It really helps me feel more connected with the bigger picture.</p><p>Regardless if you celebrate this new season with time outdoors, new hobbies or fresh foods, I hope you start to feel lighter this season and ready to take on the world around you!</p><p>(Brittany Leonard is a teacher at Chemainus Secondary School, an author and yoga instructor at The Hive Collective in Chemainus).</p><p>Copyright 2024 Chemainus Valley Courier</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHVCWR-news20240315PCC4582058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHVCWR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJP-63W1-F0HF-803H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484147</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

Conditions are expected to improve Monday afternoon or evening.<br/><br/> Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerable from hour to hour. <br/><br/> Visit firesmoke.ca to see smoke forecasts for your area. Any health-related concerns about smoke, please call Ontario Health at 811 or 1-866-797-0007.<br/><br/> For more details, please consult canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.<br/><br/> Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone's health even at low concentrations. Everyone can take action to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke.<br/><br/> People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season.<br/><br/> Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you or someone in your care feel unwell. Contact your health care provider or local health authority if you develop severe symptoms or need advice.<br/><br/> Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and monitor your symptoms. People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears. Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.<br/><br/> If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.<br/><br/> Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.<br/><br/> If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.<br/><br/> Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.<br/><br/> Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.<br/><br/> If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.<br/><br/> Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.<br/><br/> Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2023062668308857</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JS-1CJ1-JDV5-F2NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Drinking lots of water can help your body cope with the smoke.</p><p>If you have an HVAC system in your home, use the highest rated MERV filter for your system (ideally rated 13 or higher) and set the fan to recirculate air constantly. You can also use a portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaner. Keep your doors and windows closed if the temperature in your home is comfortable.</p><p>Take a break from the smoke at a location in your community where you can find clean, cool air.</p><p>If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.</p><p>Be sure to check on people in your care and those around you who may be more susceptible to smoke.</p><p>Reduce sources of indoor air pollution. If you can, avoid smoking or vaping indoors, burning incense and candles, frying foods, using wood stoves and vacuuming. Dust on indoor surfaces can be removed by wiping and wet mopping during a pollution episode.</p><p>If you experience any feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, contact your mental health care provider for advice or visit wellnesstogether.ca/en-CA.</p><p>Visit airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.</p><p>Persons in and around the above areas are advised to check back for updates and to continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada found here for the Town of Parry Sound - Rosseau - Killbear Park; and here for Bayfield Inlet - Dunchurch.</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20230626TMPC2023062668308857</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JT-T6J1-F197-54RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

It\u2019s always disappointing when the forest fire seasons starts (earlier and earlier each year), so enjoying the warmth of a fire while it\u2019s safe to do so is a great option.

You could take a few moments to meditate in the sun or simply reflect on your life and any new habits you\u2019d like to adopt this season. This is a great time of year to try something new-tackle something on that bucket list of yours. Doing new things is a fantastic way to manifest good energy and feel alive.</p><p>For those of you who enjoy practicing yoga or finding more spiritual ways of connecting with nature, you could indulge in some \u2018Sun Salutations\u2019 in a comfortable place outside. The \u2018Sun Salutation\u2019 is a series of yoga poses that bring countless benefits to the mind and body. It improves circulation, rate of respiration, balances the endocrine systems and strengthens the joints and bones. Personally, I like starting the day with a couple of \u2018Sun Salutations\u2019 in the spring, looking out onto my lawn and I get to notice the subtle changes of the sun\u2019s light as we get closer to the solstice. It really helps me feel more connected with the bigger picture.</p><p>Regardless if you celebrate this new season with time outdoors, new hobbies or fresh foods, I hope you start to feel lighter this season and ready to take on the world around you!

The First Nation has called Obsidian\u2019s \u201cintimidation tactics \u2026 the worst we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d </p><p>A week later, Obsidian CEO Steven Loukas flew to the region for scheduled negotiations with representatives of the First Nation, including Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom, band council and their lawyer, at a Peace River hotel. </p><p>The talks didn\u2019t last long, with the First Nation\u2019s team leaving the meeting after less than 10 minutes. </p><p>After RCMP entered and exited the conference room where the oil company\u2019s representatives remained, Woodland Cree Coun. Joe Whitehead Jr. and the nation\u2019s legal counsel returned without Chief Laboucan-Avirom for about five minutes. </p><p>On his way out of the hotel, Laboucan-Avirom told Morin that he was leaving because Obsidian \u201chad no intent to negotiate.\u201d </p><p>When Morin approached Loukas for comment as he slipped out the back door, the oil executive would only comment on the Stanley Cup playoffs. </p><p>Within an hour, the First Nation received an email declaring that Obsidian intended to take legal action and have the chief arrested. </p><p>A request was filed in a Calgary court on May 14 to have the First Nation and its chief charged with contempt of court for violating its injunction, and asking that Laboucan-Avirom and other nation representatives be arrested and \u201cplaced into custody\u201d until their blockade is dismantled. </p><p>It argues the First Nation is \u201cobstructing Obsidian\u2019s lawfully permitted activities and causing loss and damage to Obsidian.\u201d </p><p>According to the filing, the RCMP has \u201cindicated that they have no plans to enforce\u201d the injunction. </p><p>An RCMP liaison confirmed Morin that the Mounties would prefer to facilitate \u201cpeaceful negotiations\u201d between the company and First Nation. </p><p>Chief Laboucan-Avirom told Morin that his nation isn\u2019t opposed to oil drilling on its territory per se, but that it wants a fair share of Obsidian Energy\u2019s profits. </p><p>\u201cIf I get arrested for sticking up for our lands, sticking up for our treaty, sticking up for what we believe in,\u201d Chief Laboucan-Avirom said, \u201cI think that will be a shame on the province, on the country, and on industry. We\u2019re more sophisticated than that, and we\u2019re here to stay. [These are] our traditional lands, this is our backyard.\u201d </p><p>He added that he wants \u201cto develop a process that works for everyone.\u201d </p><p>Another concern he identified is a series of earthquakes the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) found were caused by Obsidian disposing industrial wastewater underground. One of these earthquakes, at a magnitude of 5.6, was the largest recorded in Alberta\u2019s history. </p><p>Chief Laboucan-Avirom said he wants improved consultation and input on environmental standards for Obsidian\u2019s operations on his nation\u2019s territory. </p><p>The company, meanwhile, contends that Woodland Cree First Nation\u2019s demands would establish \u201ca monopoly in its favour,\u201d which it argues would be unfair to the other First Nations in the region it\u2019s partnered with. </p><p>But Woodland Cree, in a May 13 news release, says its blockade has support from \u201ca growing number of First Nations in Alberta,\u201d including Treaty 8 First Nations, Duncan\u2019s First Nation, Sucker Creek First Nation and Loon River First Nation, among others, who have either joined the blockade encampment or written letters of support. </p><p>The blockade, which consists of about 100 people, including sympathetic industry partners, is set up like a traditional Cree camp, which includes a teepee, mobile kitchen, porta potties and lawn chairs. </p><p>Elders are bussed into the encampment daily to visit, play cards, trade stories, and offer support to band leadership. </p><p>At the same time, youth cut fresh moose harvested from the land and hang it to dry over an open fire. </p><p>Chief Laboucan-Avirom connected Woodland Cree First Nation\u2019s displacement from its traditional lands to extractive industries. </p><p>\u201cWe want to continue to enhance our understanding of what\u2019s going on because there\u2019s also cumulative impacts and effects that surround us, whether it\u2019s from pipeline spills, produced water spills, earthquakes, forest fire, drought. We want to control what\u2019s in our backyard,\u201d he told Morin. </p><p>The chief accused Obsidian, which produces 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, of \u201cmanipulation\u201d in pursuit of its efforts to increase production by 12 per cent this year. </p><p>\u201cIf they want to sustain development, they have to work with us in a meaningful way. It might be a lack of understanding. If you have an American company that does business in a certain way,\u201d said Laboucan-Avirom. </p><p>Jeremy Appel is a Local Journalism Initiative Reporter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-f14c52786f53461bafa6e06060a7bbcc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C3S-6XX1-JBVR-34RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><timeReceived>05:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 24, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The RPAS fleet will be split between 19 Wing Comox and 14 Wing Greenwood, NS.</p><p>A new ground control centre will also be built in Ottawa.</p><p>Lalonde said the project will support nearly 700 jobs between the two locations for trades, construction and training, along with the addition of 25 personnel that will be permanently added to 19 Wing.</p><p>RPAS will also help Canada fulfill its NORAD and NATO missions while increasing interoperability with US and NATO forces, added Lalonde.</p><p>Copyright 2023 Vancouver Island Free Daily</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAIFDI-news20231219PVC4551342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAIFDI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69XD-X091-F0HF-82CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"322\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

One of them, local product Danny Skelton, was a CFL quarterback internship participant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Maier and last season's backups Tommy Stevens and Logan Bonner were joined by CFL veteran Matt Shiltz, Kyle Vantrease and Chris Reynolds to start main camp.</p><p>\"That's part of the business right?\" Maier said. \"It is a healthy competition. Everyone gets along well. You're either producing or you're not. I plan on producing and doing what I need to do.\"</p><p>Calgary (6-12-0) won the turtle derby for the West Division's third and final playoff spot in 2023 before falling 41-30 to the B.C. Lions in the division semifinal.</p><p>The Stampeders ranked last in the league in touchdowns (36) and average offensive yards per game (335.5). Calgary topped the CFL in field goals with kicker Rene Paredes going 52 for 60.</p><p>In his first full season as a starter, Maier led the league in completions (363) and passing attempts (578), but his completion percentage (62.8) and efficiency (85) ranked outside the top CFL starters.</p><p>\"He's pushed himself,\" said Stampeders head coach and general manager Dave Dickenson. \"As a whole unit, we've got to up our game. That starts with the front, the o-line. We've watched the tape from last year. We didn't give him any comfort early on. We made more mental errors than we can afford to make. </p><p>\"We did improve as the year went on limiting our three-and-outs. If we're going to really win games, we can't keep giving Rene career stats. That can be getting more opportunities, but that's also taking advantage when we're down inside that 20-yard line.\"</p><p>Schiltz, 31, played six CFL seasons with the Montreal Alouettes and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Calgary's backup Stevens scored six short-yardage rushing touchdowns in 2023. </p><p>Bonner was the Stampeders' third-stringer and Reynolds a practice roster QB. Vantrease, 25, is a University of Buffalo alum.</p><p>\"I was happy with the guys here last year, but I did want to bring in a veteran guy and Matt's done that,\" Dickenson said. \"We've had Kyle on our (negotiation) list for quite awhile.\"</p><p>Maier, who took the starting job from Bo Levi Mitchell midway through the 2022 season, wasn't uncomfortable with five other men at camp trying to take his job.</p><p>\"I'm not. I came into this league in a situation where I was battling with a guy who is a Hall of Famer and I understood the role that came with that,\" said the 27-year-old from Fullerton, Calif. \"When you break it down, how can I keep my life simple, how can I focus on my fundamentals and how do I clear my mind every day? </p><p>\"None of that has to do with any external factors or who's here? Who's not? What's the outside world saying? Should I be here? Should I not? Should I start? If I think too much about that stuff, I'm just wasting my time, wasting my thoughts.\"</p><p>Maier altered his diet in the off-season to drop weight, and ran more.</p><p>\"That's not just hopping on a treadmill or running miles,\" he said. \"That's speed work, change of direction and short bursts. I'm down a few pounds and I'm quicker than I have (been) since I've been in this league.\"</p><p>Dickenson admitted it's difficult to give all quarterbacks enough work in the Stampeders' lighter camp schedule to preserve bodies. Two-a-days are gone and the players were off the field Sunday after an hour 45 minutes.</p><p>\"It is the right move at this point. Health is important,\" Dickenson said. \"Just got to to make sure we give them enough reps. That's going to be the challenge.\"</p><p>Forest fire smoke from northern B.C. that sent the Edmonton Eskimos indoors Sunday cleared enough in southern Alberta for the Stampeders to practice outside in the morning.</p><p>Receivers Jalen Philpot, Malik Henry and Clark Barnes were present and accounted for. </p><p>University of Calgary product Philpot sat out the 2023 season rehabbing a hamstring injury, Henry suffered a season-ending Achilles tendon rupture July 15 and Guelph alum Barnes underwent season-ending knee surgery in August.</p><p>The Stampeders play two pre-season games starting May 25 at home against the Lions, followed by a May 31 road game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p><p>Calgary's season-opener June 7 against the Tiger-Cats could feature Mitchell's first game at McMahon since the two-time winner of the CFL's Most Outstanding Player award was traded in 2022. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 12, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-075e536058b349a2922de748ad884c19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C16-JKW1-JBVR-300J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><timeReceived>04:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 12, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets

ADDED May 2, 2024</p><p>TIMELINE</p><p>Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p>City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the rollout of the program.</p><p>In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95 Aquinas Avenue, between

At times it felt like I got on Mr. Toad's wild ride, not realizing that the ride was going to loop 497 times. But most anyone who has been on set can tell you there is beauty to the chaos of filmmaking, even when you want to melt into a puddle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an experience truly unique to itself and no matter how much you think you know, you always find there's infinitely more things to know and a million different ways to try things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sometimes you learn those lessons in really fun ways, and sometimes you learn them in soul crushing ways, but those are the memories that ultimately make up the lifespan of your career so I try to take all of it in stride, appreciate it for what it is and laugh about it all.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's all art and it's all an education. I learned so much about myself, how I operate (at least for now) and what I'd like to experiment with moving forward.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHoCZ3VKkP4?feature=oembed\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHoCZ3VKkP4?feature=oembed</url></p><p>What was it like working with Freddie Prize Jr. and Monica Potter?</p><p>Hysterical. Monica was running a one woman comedy side-show which included some of the most wonderfully random improv you've ever heard come out of a person's mouth.</p><p>Our editor was rolling laughing watching the dailies because he just never knew what he was in for take to take. And Freddie always had some delightful commentary about my wardrobe, which was definitely haphazard at best.</p><p>My favorite one was something along the lines of, 'It looks like you got lost on a safari.' It was so interesting to watch them work together because they have totally</p><p>different approaches to their craft, which really reinforces that there is no 'right way' to do anything.</p><p>It's just finding what works for you and being willing to play. I am so grateful that even though they have these longstanding careers, they really put a lot of trust and confidence in me as a newer filmmaker to put all the puzzle pieces in place, even when that meant going off script or deviating from a plan. That stands true for every one of our cast members.</p><p>Truthfully, I love when things are messy and mistakes happen, which can be very disorienting in environments that seemingly demand order and precision. Everyone was willing to play in that mess and trust that there was some sanity to what I was doing, which is a really special thing to have.</p><p>I think in part it was because it gave them freedom to try things as well, which is so much more fun than just adhering to the idea what something should be.</p><p>What was your most memorable experience directing this film?</p><p>Wrapping. There is an all consuming, very specific energy after the final shot on the final day that's reminiscent of pulling an all nighter in middle school. It's an air of uninhibited, reckless and fulfilled freedom, it's hard to put into words.</p><p>How does it feel to be a filmmaker in the digital age?</p><p>It feels like a blessing and a curse, and constantly oscillates between the two depending on what we're talking about it in reference to. In so many ways the vast emergence and refining of technology offers immense opportunity and flexibility.</p><p>More artists are able to get content out there (be it directing, self-tapes, writing forums, etc.) and are able to connect with more people.</p><p>To that note, things can also feel so oversaturated that everything becomes seemingly irrelevant. The high accessibility of other industry professionals via social media or other platforms has rendered them totally inaccessible because now we are all essentially just virtual junk mail to anyone outside our inner circle, which is why it's so important to build relationships via human contact.</p><p>Even the means of how things are executed has shifted. Filmmakers are able to shoot things that wouldn't have been physically or monetarily possible in eras past. I also think there is something so charming about practical filmmaking that can get lost in this time that is so heavily immersed in digital offerings.</p><p>Social media, don't even get me started. My inactivity on Instagram speaks for itself and when I'm on there - trust the experience is cushioned with anxiety.</p><p>Admittedly, I'm not a salesperson, I hate pitching myself. I just want to show up and do the work, but we are in a time that seems to demand we go beyond the realm of our strengths and desires. It's something I'm constantly trying to wrap my head around.</p><p>What do your plans for the future include?</p><p>I'd really love to align with filmmakers who inspired (and continue to inspire) my artistic interests. There's some very specific things I'd like to explore with content moving forward so I'm really focusing on integrating myself with other creators who are open to experimenting in a similar way.</p><p>I'm also very determined to dive further into horror, which is an ongoing development for me in addition to a TV series I'm developing with some friends, which we're all very stoked on.</p><p>What is your advice for young and aspiring filmmakers?</p><p>It's okay to be intentional with what you want to invest your time and energy into. Sometimes this means saying no to things that cross your path and trusting that means you are saying 'yes' to the things you align with. This isn't just your career, this is your life.</p><p>If you are miserable doing something then your energy is probably better spent somewhere else. On the flipside, it's also being willing to say yes to the things that scare us.</p><p>Fear isn't always something that blocks us, sometimes it's the thing blindly pushing us forward. Really knowing yourself - what you want, what inspires you and what terrifies you will serve as a greater compass than any single piece of industry advice as you navigate a world that is designed to be uniquely yours.</p><p>What does the word success mean to you? (My favorite question)</p><p>Feeling good about the choices you make, both day to day and in your work, regardless of the outcome. And maybe being able to eat whatever you want without thinking about how much it costs.</p><p>What would you like to tell our readers about 'The Girl in the Pool'? (What's the one</p><p>thing you want them to get out of it)</p><p>For all intensive purposes, this film is a thriller, but. Tom's situation is so wildly absurd that it borders on comical, which is something we worked to lean into. Tom is a ridiculous person whose life is being ripped to shreds at his own hands and he's totally delusional about it.</p><p>There's this running theme that he is going to fix the situation, but his idea of 'fixing things' is just pouring kerosene on a forest fire and thinking that's somehow contained the flames. He's inept to say the least and it's really fun to watch Freddie step into that persona and fully unravel. During pre-pro he and I would laugh about making Tom the ultimate beta.</p><p>Though I'm guessing that didn't fully land because I keep catching word of people commenting about them loving this hot, brooding dad vibe he's giving. Which honestly just makes Tom even funnier to me.</p><p>To learn more about director Dakota Gorman, follow her on  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/dakotagorman/\">Instagram.</url></p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/dakota-gorman-talks-about-directing-the-girl-in-the-pool/article\">Dakota Gorman talks about directing 'The Girl in the Pool' appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/\">Digital Journal.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/dakota-gorman-talks-about-directing-the-girl-in-the-pool/article\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDJ-DIJO10090352210713951375720200033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH4-9XY1-JCMN-Y4FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1229\"/><timeReceived>9:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Most of those were in Alberta, which saw unusually warm weather in late April and early May of last year, with almost no rain. </p><p>By that date Alberta was already asking for help to fight fires, and 25,000 people had been forced to flee their homes. Almost 6,000 square kilometres had already burned.</p><p>That extreme start led to the worst fire season Canada has seen by far, with 6,600 fires burning more than 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area greater than all of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined.</p><p>Julienne Morissette, the director of wildland fire research for Natural Resources Canada, said Alberta's spring has been a bit cooler this year, with more precipitation.</p><p>\"While it looks more positive we are still under the effects of significant drought so as temperatures warm, things can dry very quickly,\" she said.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada said about one-third of the fires burning now are zombie fires that started last year, went underground for the winter and re-emerged after the snow melted. </p><p>Just more than 176 square kilometres have burned so far, said Morissette, well below the 25-year average of 510 square kilometres.</p><p>Of the current fires, 40 are burning in Alberta, 24 in British Columbia and 10 in Manitoba. The four fires burning in New Brunswick are the only ones in Atlantic Canada, while Ontario has two and Quebec one.</p><p>The fire forecast for the rest of May and June shows an elevated risk across all of Western Canada except for the west coast of British Columbia. There is very high to extreme risk in much of southern and central Saskatchewan, parts of northern Alberta and the interior of British Columbia.</p><p>Most of Ontario and western Quebec are at moderate risk, while eastern Quebec and Atlantic Canada show low risk.</p><p>Most of Yukon and Northwest Territories and part of southern Nunavut are at high risk of fires in May. In June the risk across much of Northwest Territories and Yukon extends to very high and extreme.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said the lessons from last summer are guiding planning for this summer. That includes launching a pilot project to better co-ordinate with and utilize volunteers from aid groups including the Salvation Army, the Canadian Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada, known as SARVAC.</p><p>The groups are part of what Canada calls the \"humanitarian workforce,\" which launched during COVID-19 to help respond to domestic emergencies. Sajjan has been working with them and the Armed Forces on the early stages of a Canadian national response agency, in a bid to find alternatives to deploying the military as often during emergencies.</p><p>Last summer there were 18 requests for federal assistance from the provinces and territories, and 2,135 Canadian Armed Forces personnel were deployed to help.</p><p>Sajjan said this summer a project is launching in B.C. and Northwest Territories, two of the hardest hit regions in 2023 and two of the highest risk regions in 2024.</p><p>SARVAC will establish a group of 200 volunteers who can deploy for up to three weeks within 72 hours of getting a call. The Salvation Army is repositioning supplies including non-perishable food in five high-risk areas in B.C. and two in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>St. John's Ambulance and the Canadian Red Cross have established rosters of thousands of volunteers who can be called upon, with specific skill sets identified.</p><p>Leaders from the organizations will be embedded within the government operations centre this summer so deployments can be co-ordinated quickly.</p><p>Sajjan also said that Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization, will join the humanitarian workforce program, drawing on the knowledge and skills of former Canadian military members.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NFALLS-2024051171453351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NFALLS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0S-R3N1-F197-50FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Disclosure information is available on the original site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Author: Mark Winfield, Professor, Environmental and Urban Change, York University, Canada</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even with the Ontario legislature rising for an extended summer break, the province\u2019s politics have been rife with rumours of an early election call by Conservative Premier Doug Ford. </p><p>Past experience suggests that this could be a high-risk strategy, especially only two years into a June 2022 majority mandate that ultimately rested on the ballots of less than 18 per cent of eligible Ontario voters. </p><p>Why now?</p><p>A number of potential rationales for an early election call in Ontario have been offered:</p><p>\u2014 Getting ahead of further fallout from the Greenbelt land removal scandal that will flow from freedom-of-information requests and an RCMP investigation.</p><p>\u2014 A possible change in the federal government with the possibility of a new government being less willing to facilitate and finance Ford\u2019s grandiose nuclear energy and highway megaprojects.</p><p>\u2014 A bigger potential for the consequences of earlier decisions to come home to roost, ranging from the financial crisis in the post-secondary education sector to ongoing challenges around health care, education and affordable housing, especially  rental housing.</p><p>\u2014 An opportunity to interfere with the ability of the new leader of the Ontario Liberal Party to raise funds, establish a presence and build a public profile while the Ford government remains ahead in the polls.</p><p>The basis of Ford\u2019s political success</p><p>The Ford government\u2019s political success so far, despite numerous missteps and scandals, has a lot to do with the effectiveness of its rhetorical response to the impact of Ontario\u2019s transition from an industrial- to service-based economy. </p><p>Ford\u2019s form of market populism has combined a deeply pro-business policy approach with a populist focus on reducing costs to consumers, like taxes and hydro rates, in the short term. But in doing so, the province\u2019s labour market has also become increasingly polarized in terms of geography, income and employment security.</p><p>Ford weathered the challenges of COVID-19 by incorporating a more activist, \u201cget it done\u201d stance into his style of governing. At the same time, his political rivals failed to provide compelling alternative visions of Ontario\u2019s economic future. </p><p>Those seeking to unseat the Ford government in the next provincial election will need to offer different and compelling ways to address the polarized labour market and economic divisions in Ontario. These ideas will need to move beyond the neoliberal and populist ideals that underpin Ford\u2019s political success.</p><p>Vulnerable on environment, climate</p><p>With this in mind, the environment and climate change remain key areas of vulnerability for the Ford government because they illustrate its fundamentally reactive governance style. Another bad forest fire season this summer could further underscore the province\u2019s lack of any credible plan for reducing GHG emissions or responding to the impacts of a changing climate. </p><p>Ontario\u2019s record of emission reductions flowing from the 2003-2013 phaseout of coal-fired electricity and wider industrial restructuring has largely played out. Emissions are now rising, especially from the electricity sector, with a dramatic growth in the role of natural gas-fired generation, along with increases related to building heating and cooling and transportation. </p><p>In those sectors, the government is focused on expanding access to fossil fuels \u2014 particularly natural gas for space heating \u2014 and building new highways.</p><p>Voters agitating?</p><p>The successful mobilization of organized labour against the Ford government\u2019s proposed use of the notwithstanding clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to impose a contract on education workers highlights the risks of further significant social and political action against the government. </p><p>The widespread outrage over the government\u2019s removal of land from the Greater Toronto Area Greenbelt for urban development again emphasized Ford\u2019s potential vulnerabilities, despite his current lead in the opinion polls. </p><p>The question of who actually wins under Ford\u2019s market populism must also loom large \u2014 everyday Ontario residents or well-connected developers, resource industries and entrenched incumbents in the energy and for-profit health-care sectors? </p><p>Fiscal irresponsibility?</p><p>There are also growing questions about the government\u2019s fiscal responsibility.  </p><p>Over the last two years, the government has committed at least $150 billion in large energy and transportation infrastructure projects. Many of these projects \u2014 including Highway 413, the Highway 404-to-400 Bradford Bypass and the Pickering B nuclear station refurbishment \u2014 have been previously assessed as unnecessary and uneconomic.</p><p>The emerging financial impacts of accelerating the initiative to make beer and wine available at corner stores have the potential to add hundreds of millions more to the government\u2019s pattern of casually scrapping stable long-term revenue streams. In addition to the $225 million in up-front compensation to The Beer Store, there are projected losses to the province in LCBO revenues, licencing and cost-of-service fees.</p><p>More broadly, the province has lost approximately $1 billion a year in revenues from the cancellation of the greenhouse gas cap and trade program, the elimination of vehicle licencing fees and reductions in the provincial gasoline tax. </p><p>What\u2019s more, there\u2019s an ongoing $7 billion a year diversion of general revenues designed to artificially lower hydro rates. This strategy takes funds needed urgently in areas like health care and education and effectively uses them to hide the actual costs of previous nuclear refurbishment projects.</p><p>All of these factors should amount to a moment of deep political vulnerability for the Ford government. But how voters might actually respond to an early election call if \u2014 unlike in 2022 \u2014 they respond at all, remains an open question. ___</p><p>Mark Winfield receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. ___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Most of those were in Alberta, which saw unusually warm weather in late April and early May of last year, with almost no rain. </p><p>By that date Alberta was already asking for help to fight fires, and 25,000 people had been forced to flee their homes. Almost 6,000 square kilometres had already burned.</p><p>That extreme start led to the worst fire season Canada has seen by far, with 6,600 fires burning more than 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area greater than all of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined.</p><p>Julienne Morissette, the director of wildland fire research for Natural Resources Canada, said Alberta's spring has been a bit cooler this year, with more precipitation.</p><p>\"While it looks more positive we are still under the effects of significant drought so as temperatures warm, things can dry very quickly,\" she said.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada said about one-third of the fires burning now are zombie fires that started last year, went underground for the winter and re-emerged after the snow melted. </p><p>Just more than 176 square kilometres have burned so far, said Morissette, well below the 25-year average of 510 square kilometres.</p><p>Of the current fires, 40 are burning in Alberta, 24 in British Columbia and 10 in Manitoba. The four fires burning in New Brunswick are the only ones in Atlantic Canada, while Ontario has two and Quebec one.</p><p>The fire forecast for the rest of May and June shows an elevated risk across all of Western Canada except for the west coast of British Columbia. There is very high to extreme risk in much of southern and central Saskatchewan, parts of northern Alberta and the interior of British Columbia.</p><p>Most of Ontario and western Quebec are at moderate risk, while eastern Quebec and Atlantic Canada show low risk.</p><p>Most of Yukon and Northwest Territories and part of southern Nunavut are at high risk of fires in May. In June the risk across much of Northwest Territories and Yukon extends to very high and extreme.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said the lessons from last summer are guiding planning for this summer. That includes launching a pilot project to better co-ordinate with and utilize volunteers from aid groups including the Salvation Army, the Canadian Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada, known as SARVAC.</p><p>The groups are part of what Canada calls the \"humanitarian workforce,\" which launched during COVID-19 to help respond to domestic emergencies. Sajjan has been working with them and the Armed Forces on the early stages of a Canadian national response agency, in a bid to find alternatives to deploying the military as often during emergencies.</p><p>Last summer there were 18 requests for federal assistance from the provinces and territories, and 2,135 Canadian Armed Forces personnel were deployed to help.</p><p>Sajjan said this summer a project is launching in B.C. and Northwest Territories, two of the hardest hit regions in 2023 and two of the highest risk regions in 2024.</p><p>SARVAC will establish a group of 200 volunteers who can deploy for up to three weeks within 72 hours of getting a call. The Salvation Army is repositioning supplies including non-perishable food in five high-risk areas in B.C. and two in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>St. John's Ambulance and the Canadian Red Cross have established rosters of thousands of volunteers who can be called upon, with specific skill sets identified.</p><p>Leaders from the organizations will be embedded within the government operations centre this summer so deployments can be co-ordinated quickly.</p><p>Sajjan also said that Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization, will join the humanitarian workforce program, drawing on the knowledge and skills of former Canadian military members.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2024051171453148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0S-R3N1-F197-508G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Premier David Eby announced last month that the province had worked out an agreement with Meta and had received assurances that it would work with B.C. emergency officials to deliver and amplify public information in case of natural disasters such as wildfires.</p><p>Meta began blocking Canadian news content on its platforms in August just before fires swept through B.C.'s southern Interior.</p><p>Trudeau was in West Kelowna last August, just days after a wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes.</p><p>On Friday, the prime minister said he met with mayors and fires chiefs of those same communities, along with a number of families who lost homes in the B.C. Interior and who are still impacted by the situation.</p><p>\"We know from the forecasts in Western and Northern Canada, because of the dry winter \u2026 it is likely to be a very bad forest fire season,\" he said during a news conference at the West Kelowna firehall.</p><p>He said lessons learned last year would help minimize the impacts of the fires expected this summer.</p><p>B.C.'s snowpack is at the lowest level ever recorded and drought levels are already high in the province's northeast.</p><p>Drought conditions in B.C. stretch back to 2022, and forecasters have said the province is heading into this summer with \"multi-year\" precipitation deficits</p><p>West Kelowna Fire Chief Jason Brolund met with Trudeau before the news conference on Friday with some requests.</p><p>Brolund became the face of the B.C. wildfires last summer as he described the battle against the blazes and the loss they incurred. The chief later spoke to a United Nations conference on climate change, saying the firefight was the toughest three days of his career as entire neighbourhoods burned.</p><p>He said fire crews were facing blazes that were nearly impossible for them to defeat, partly because of changing climate that made it easier for the fires to burn.</p><p>Brolund said he thanked Trudeau for doubling the tax credit for volunteer firefighters, which adds an extra $425 for each volunteer, but he wants that to be even larger.</p><p>He said he asked him to reinstate the joint emergency preparedness grants for training and equipment for fire departments, and they want the fire smart program rolled out on a national scale to have measurable impacts in communities.</p><p>\"I felt like his ears were wide open,\" Brolund said of Trudeau.</p><p>Temperatures could reach record levels in B.C.'s Interior this weekend, and Brolund said they're watching the weather closely.</p><p>June is historically the rainiest month and fire officials were hoping to get that this year, the chief said.</p><p>\"If we don't, our departments are ready. We have new equipment, we have new training, we have firefighters in place,\" he said.</p><p>\"What we have the most of is a sense in spirit of co-operation among the region. And we saw that today when the mayors and fire chiefs came together to share our experience with the prime minister.\"</p><p>Brieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press</p><p>Copyright 2024 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20240511PAB4602058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0V-H4X1-JD2C-J00W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Group Ltd.

Most of those were in Alberta, which saw unusually warm weather in late April and early May of last year, with almost no rain. </p><p>By that date Alberta was already asking for help to fight fires, and 25,000 people had been forced to flee their homes. Almost 6,000 square kilometres had already burned.</p><p>That extreme start led to the worst fire season Canada has seen by far, with 6,600 fires burning more than 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area greater than all of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined.</p><p>Julienne Morissette, the director of wildland fire research for Natural Resources Canada, said Alberta's spring has been a bit cooler this year, with more precipitation.</p><p>\"While it looks more positive we are still under the effects of significant drought so as temperatures warm, things can dry very quickly,\" she said.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada said about one-third of the fires burning now are zombie fires that started last year, went underground for the winter and re-emerged after the snow melted. </p><p>Just more than 176 square kilometres have burned so far, said Morissette, well below the 25-year average of 510 square kilometres.</p><p>Of the current fires, 40 are burning in Alberta, 24 in British Columbia and 10 in Manitoba. The four fires burning in New Brunswick are the only ones in Atlantic Canada, while Ontario has two and Quebec one.</p><p>The fire forecast for the rest of May and June shows an elevated risk across all of Western Canada except for the west coast of British Columbia. There is very high to extreme risk in much of southern and central Saskatchewan, parts of northern Alberta and the interior of British Columbia.</p><p>Most of Ontario and western Quebec are at moderate risk, while eastern Quebec and Atlantic Canada show low risk.</p><p>Most of Yukon and Northwest Territories and part of southern Nunavut are at high risk of fires in May. In June the risk across much of Northwest Territories and Yukon extends to very high and extreme.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said the lessons from last summer are guiding planning for this summer. That includes launching a pilot project to better co-ordinate with and utilize volunteers from aid groups including the Salvation Army, the Canadian Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada, known as SARVAC.</p><p>The groups are part of what Canada calls the \"humanitarian workforce,\" which launched during COVID-19 to help respond to domestic emergencies. Sajjan has been working with them and the Armed Forces on the early stages of a Canadian national response agency, in a bid to find alternatives to deploying the military as often during emergencies.</p><p>Last summer there were 18 requests for federal assistance from the provinces and territories, and 2,135 Canadian Armed Forces personnel were deployed to help.</p><p>Sajjan said this summer a project is launching in B.C. and Northwest Territories, two of the hardest hit regions in 2023 and two of the highest risk regions in 2024.</p><p>SARVAC will establish a group of 200 volunteers who can deploy for up to three weeks within 72 hours of getting a call. The Salvation Army is repositioning supplies including non-perishable food in five high-risk areas in B.C. and two in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>St. John's Ambulance and the Canadian Red Cross have established rosters of thousands of volunteers who can be called upon, with specific skill sets identified.</p><p>Leaders from the organizations will be embedded within the government operations centre this summer so deployments can be co-ordinated quickly.</p><p>Sajjan also said that Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization, will join the humanitarian workforce program, drawing on the knowledge and skills of former Canadian military members.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2024051171453917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0S-R3N1-F197-50J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

All of our employees and contractors staff have been safely evacuated and we have taken appropriate measures to secure and mitigate risk to the Fenelon camp site. Exploration activities at Fenelon and our other projects will resume as soon as practicable.</p><p>The news release from the Ministre des Ressources naturelles et des Forts (Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests) announcing the prohibition can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/incendies-de-foret-modif\">https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/incendies-de-foret-modif</url> ication-du-territoire-touche-par-linterdiction-dacces-en-foret-sur-les-terr es-du-domaine-de-letat-et-par-la-fermeture-de-chemins-48424</p><p>About Wallbridge Mining</p><p>Wallbridge is focused on creating value through the exploration and sustainable development of gold projects along the Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend while respecting the environment and communities where it operates.</p><p>Wallbridges flagship project, Fenelon Gold (Fenelon), is located on the highly prospective Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend Property in Qubecs Northern Abitibi region. An updated mineral resource estimate completed in January 2023 yielded significantly improved grades and additional ounces at the 100%-owned Fenelon and Martiniere projects, incorporating a combined 3.05 million ounces of indicated gold resources and 2.35 million ounces of inferred gold resources. Fenelon and Martiniere are located within an 830 km2 exploration land package controlled by Wallbridge. The Company believes that these two deposits have good potential for economic development, especially given their proximity to existing hydro-electric power and transportation infrastructure. In addition, Wallbridge believes that the extensive land package is extremely prospective for the discovery of additional gold deposits.</p><p>Wallbridge also holds a 19.9% interest in the common shares of Archer Exploration Corp. (Archer) as a result of the sale of the Companys portfolio of nickel assets in Ontario and Qubec in November of 2022.</p><p>Wallbridge will continue to focus on its core Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend Property while enabling shareholders to participate in the potential economic upside in Archer.</p><p>For further information please visit the Companys website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wallbridgemining.com\">www.wallbridgemining.com</url> or contact:</p><p>Wallbridge Mining Company Limited</p><p>Marz Kord, P.

FLI is based on expectations, estimates, projections, and interpretations as at the date of this press release.</p><p>All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein are FLI that involve various risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. Generally, FLI can be identified by the use of statements that include words such as seeks, believes, anticipates, plans, continues, budget, scheduled, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, projects, predicts, proposes, \"potential\", targets and variations of such words and phrases, or by statements that certain actions, events or results may, will, could, would, should or might, be taken, occur or be achieved.</p><p>FLI herein includes but is not limited to: statements regarding the potential future performance of Archer common shares; future drill results; the Companys ability to convert inferred resources into measured and indicated resources; environmental matters; stakeholder engagement and relationships; parameters and methods used to estimate the MREs at the Fenelon Gold (defined below) and Martiniere (defined below) properties (collectively the Deposits); the prospects, if any, of the Deposits; future drilling at the Deposits; and the significance of historic exploration activities and results.</p><p>FLI is designed to help you understand managements current views of its near- and longer-term prospects, and it may not be appropriate for other purposes. FLI by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such FLI. Although the FLI contained in this press release is based upon what management believes, or believed at the time, to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure shareholders and prospective purchasers of securities of the Company that actual results will be consistent with such FLI, as there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any such FLI. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake, and assumes no obligation, to update or revise any such FLI contained herein to reflect new events or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, this press release has been prepared based on information available as of the date of this press release. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the FLI, or information contained herein.</p><p>Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in FLI.</p><p>Assumptions upon which FLI is based, without limitation, include: the results of exploration activities, the Companys financial position and general economic conditions, the ability of exploration activities to accurately predict mineralization; the accuracy of geological modelling; the ability of the Company to complete further exploration activities; the legitimacy of title and property interests in the Deposits; the accuracy of key assumptions, parameters or methods used to estimate the MREs; the ability of the Company to obtain required approvals; the results of exploration activities; the evolution of the global economic climate; metal prices; environmental expectations; community and non-governmental actions; and any impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Deposits, the Companys financial position, the Companys ability to secure required funding, or operations. In addition to the MD&amp;A, risks and uncertainties about Wallbridge's business are discussed in the disclosure materials filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, which are available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>Information Concerning Estimates of Mineral Resources</p><p>The disclosure relating to the Deposits and MREs in this press release and referred to herein was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 which differs from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The terms \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" used in this press release are in reference to the mining terms defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards (the \"CIM Definition Standards\"), which definitions have been adopted by NI 43-101. Accordingly, information contained in this press release providing descriptions of our mineral deposits in accordance with NI 43-101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other U.S. companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.</p><p>Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves. Pursuant to CIM Definition Standards, \"inferred mineral resources\" are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.</p><p>Investors are cautioned that while terms, are substantially similar to CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions and standards under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\"), with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources,\" \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\". Information regarding mineral resources contained or referenced in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report according to U.S. standards. While the SEC Modernization Rules are purported to be \"substantially similar\" to the CIM Definition Standards, readers are cautioned that there are differences between the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definitions Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that the Company may report as \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

Premier David Eby announced last month that the province had worked out an agreement with Meta and had received assurances that it would work with B.C. emergency officials to deliver and amplify public information in case of natural disasters such as wildfires.</p><p>Meta began blocking Canadian news content on its platforms in August just before fires swept through B.C.'s southern Interior. </p><p>Trudeau was in West Kelowna last August, just days after a wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes. </p><p>On Friday, the prime minister said he met with mayors and fires chiefs of those same communities, along with a number of families who lost homes in the B.C. Interior and who are still impacted by the situation. </p><p>\u201cWe know from the forecasts in Western and Northern Canada, because of the dry winter \u2026 it is likely to be a very bad forest fire season,\" he said during a news conference at the West Kelowna firehall. </p><p>He said lessons learned last year would help minimize the impacts of the fires expected this summer.</p><p>B.C.'s snowpack is at the lowest level ever recorded and drought levels are already high in the province's northeast. </p><p>Drought conditions in B.C. stretch back to 2022, and forecasters have said the province is heading into this summer with \"multi-year\" precipitation deficits</p><p>West Kelowna Fire Chief Jason Brolund met with Trudeau before the news conference on Friday with some requests. </p><p>Brolund became the face of the B.C. wildfires last summer as he described the battle against the blazes and the loss they incurred. The chief later spoke to a United Nations conference on climate change, saying the firefight was the toughest three days of his career as entire neighbourhoods burned. </p><p>He said fire crews were facing blazes that were nearly impossible for them to defeat, partly because of changing climate that made it easier for the fires to burn. </p><p>Brolund said he thanked Trudeau for doubling the tax credit for volunteer firefighters, which adds an extra $425 for each volunteer, but he wants that to be even larger. </p><p>He said he asked him to reinstate the joint emergency preparedness grants for training and equipment for fire departments, and they want the fire smart program rolled out on a national scale to have measurable impacts in communities. </p><p>\"I felt like his ears were wide open,\" Brolund said of Trudeau. </p><p>Temperatures could reach record levels in B.C.'s Interior this weekend, and Brolund said they're watching the weather closely. </p><p>June is historically the rainiest month and fire officials were hoping to get that this year, the chief said. </p><p>\"If we don't, our departments are ready. We have new equipment, we have new training, we have firefighters in place,\" he said.</p><p>\"What we have the most of is a sense in spirit of co-operation among the region. And we saw that today when the mayors and fire chiefs came together to share our experience with the prime minister.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 10, 2024. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dfb56e8c68834b0c8611568a63189ad5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0S-MKD1-DY9S-T0R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><timeReceived>06:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 10, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Most of those were in Alberta, which saw unusually warm weather in late April and early May of last year, with almost no rain. </p><p>By that date Alberta was already asking for help to fight fires, and 25,000 people had been forced to flee their homes. Almost 6,000 square kilometres had already burned.</p><p>That extreme start led to the worst fire season Canada has seen by far, with 6,600 fires burning more than 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area greater than all of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined.</p><p>Julienne Morissette, the director of wildland fire research for Natural Resources Canada, said Alberta's spring has been a bit cooler this year, with more precipitation.</p><p>\"While it looks more positive we are still under the effects of significant drought so as temperatures warm, things can dry very quickly,\" she said.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada said about one-third of the fires burning now are zombie fires that started last year, went underground for the winter and re-emerged after the snow melted. </p><p>Just over 176 square kilometres have burned so far, said Morissette, well below the 25-year average of 510 square kilometres.</p><p>Of the current fires, 40 are burning in Alberta, 24 in British Columbia and 10 in Manitoba. The four fires burning in New Brunswick are the only ones in Atlantic Canada, while Ontario has two and Quebec one.</p><p>The fire forecast for the rest of May and June shows an elevated risk across all of Western Canada except for the west coast of British Columbia. There is very high to extreme risk in much of southern and central Saskatchewan, parts of northern Alberta and the interior of British Columbia.</p><p>Most of Ontario and western Quebec are at moderate risk, while eastern Quebec and Atlantic Canada show low risk.</p><p>Most of Yukon and Northwest Territories and part of southern Nunavut are at high risk of fires in May. In June the risk across much of Northwest Territories and Yukon extends to very high and extreme.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said the lessons from last summer are guiding planning for this summer. That includes launching a pilot project to better co-ordinate with and utilize volunteers from aid groups including the Salvation Army, the Canadian Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada, known as SARVAC.</p><p>The groups are part of what Canada calls the \"humanitarian workforce,\" which launched during COVID-19 to help respond to domestic emergencies. Sajjan has been working with them and the Armed Forces on the early stages of a Canadian national response agency, in a bid to find alternatives to deploying the military as often during emergencies.</p><p>Last summer there were 18 requests for federal assistance from the provinces and territories, and 2,135 Canadian Armed Forces personnel were deployed to help.</p><p>Sajjan said this summer a project is launching in B.C. and Northwest Territories, two of the hardest hit regions in 2023 and two of the highest risk regions in 2024.</p><p>SARVAC will establish a group of 200 volunteers who can deploy for up to three weeks within 72 hours of getting a call. The Salvation Army is repositioning supplies including non-perishable food in five high-risk areas in B.C. and two in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>St. John's Ambulance and the Canadian Red Cross have established rosters of thousands of volunteers who can be called upon, with specific skill sets identified.</p><p>Leaders from the organizations will be embedded within the government operations centre this summer so deployments can be co-ordinated quickly.</p><p>Sajjan also said that Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization, will join the humanitarian workforce program, drawing on the knowledge and skills of former Canadian military members.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8c820f9fb4d5464f86cd46e51352ea92</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0J-NJV1-JBVR-30DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><timeReceived>04:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 9, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
