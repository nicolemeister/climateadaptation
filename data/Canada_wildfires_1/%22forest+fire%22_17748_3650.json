It includes more than 185 trails, much on private land. The group has also grown in recent years to the point where it has almost 2,100 members. The last time UROC appeared before council, it had 721 members.</p><p>The system is the one of the leading trail networks in North America, or as Browne said, it has been described as the fifth-busiest.</p><p>\"The appetite for trail use is increasing,\" he said.</p><p>RELATED STORY: United Riders of Cumberland construct new climbing trail</p><p>This can means relationships, even conflict, among different user groups, such as hikers and bike riders, issues around proper trail etiquette and ecological impact.</p><p>\"We're always hearing about trees down and problems in the network that we go and fix,\" he said. \"The very nature of the network is changing.\"</p><p>From UROC's point of view, the strategic plan is an opportunity to focus on these issues over the next three to five years. To produce a plan, they conducted a survey of users and received more than 500 respondents. They also relied on trail counter data and feedback from stakeholders. The current draft of the plan will again be referred to council at a later date.</p><p>Goals include maintaining and enhancing the trails through the work of 63 active trail builders and which took place over many sessions. At the same time, they have to consider values such as water protection, the working forest around the trails and potential wildlife conflicts, all while creating the best user experience.</p><p>Specifically, they are looking at reducing 'pinch points,' or areas of high traffic, often where people enter or exit. Loveless and Browne even showed council heat mapping to highlight these spots as well as underscore the need for better trail connectivity and spreading users around the system. They said redesigning some trails can help reduce potential conflict.</p><p>Council members credited UROC for the work to manage the community resource.</p><p>\"You guys do a lot of great work with limited resources,\" Coun. Sean Sullivan told Loveless and Browne.</p><p>He asked about some of the pinch points, such as around Sutton Road. Loveless responded that they do have ideas on where they can disperse users to reduce the pressure on the land.</p><p>While the system and group have both grown, Browne said the aim was not one of endless expansion.</p><p>\"We're not going to build more trails for the sake of building trails,\" he said.</p><p>Others on council expressed concerns about extreme climate events such as 'atmospheric rivers' or forest fire threats and whether this might mean more periods when trails have to be closed.</p><p>Browne said they have been noticing changes in the network and may consider more closures when needed.</p><p>\"We're very aware of the change in the climate,\" he said. \"We're not really sure what's happening tomorrow, but we've definitely seen what happened yesterday.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mike.chouinard@comoxvalleyrecord.com\">mike.chouinard@comoxvalleyrecord.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Comox Valley Record</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20220407PCV4305545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:655T-GXN1-F0HF-808D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

The reverse is probably true on the Atlantic side of Florida, but sunrises aren't mentioned in the brochures.</p><p>We don't have those dramatic beginnings or fiery endings to our days up here in Canada, probably because we don't have the same humidity and particulate content in the atmosphere. Not unless there's been a recent forest fire, or smog.</p><p>Nope. What we're blessed with, are much slower transitions from daylight to darkness, and from night to day. Blessed, because they give us time to wake up slowly in the morning and time to organize and do things in the twilight of the late afternoon and evenings. In the summer there's time for kids to stretch out their games for one or two more innings, or a couple more rounds of hide and seek. And, there's time to wander a trail for miles in the gradually lengthening shadows of a late afternoon in winter, or on a summer's evening, or maybe organize a campfire.</p><p>It's different in the tropical south. There, the morning sun seems to jump straight up, is blazing straight overhead at high noon, and falls straight down at the end of the day. There's not much time between sunrise and the time of looking for shady spots in which to avoid its heat. It may explain why people in tropical climates generally get up early and get to where they need to be while it's still cool.</p><p>It's all a matter of physics, planetary motion, and where we choose to live. Up here, in the wintertime, it's a land of long shadows because the sun doesn't get too high and never feels too hot. Here, brilliant, colourful sunsets can last for as long as is necessary to take the dog for its walk, or maybe to trot home and get the camera for a shot of the sunset from up on Lookout Hill. (There's one in every town, isn't there?)</p><p>Then, on winter nights with a clear sky, a full moon, and a fresh layer of snow from a day or so before ... Well, we could say more, but then 'flamingos' might hear of it and want to flock up here.</p><p>Sunrise and sunset were simply the start and end of the day in ancient times. Only in the music of the Psalms does it become lyrical. \"Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.\" (Psalm 65:8 RSV).</p><p>Rev.

The town of about 250 was destroyed by a wildfire last June, after experiencing the hottest temperature ever recorded in Canada. Two people were killed and 10 months later, restoration work still hasn't begun.</p><p>Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair visited Lytton Thursday and promised that disaster aid of at least $416 million will be allocated. </p><p>But Lytton's rebuilding has been stymied by a number of factors including more extreme weather. Last November, the roads into the town were washed out by floods that caused $5 billion in estimated damage across British Columbia. </p><p>The winter then brought the largest snowfall to Lytton it had seen in more than three decades.</p><p>The expert panel on disaster resilience said by 2030 Canada should be able to show a measurable reduction in the number of Canadians exposed to danger from extreme weather, and be able to make every victim of a natural disaster \"whole again\" within one year.</p><p>Lytton is not the only Canadian town hit with disasters back to back. Last summer, Red Lake, Ont., and several nearby First Nations were hit with forest fires for the second year in a row, prompting evacuations and destroying thousands of hectares of land.</p><p>On May 10, the municipality 500 km northwest of Thunder Bay, declared a state of emergency because floods have washed out sections of the highway leading into town.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Friday at a news conference on forest fire preparations that no matter how successful Canadians are at cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of global warming are already upon us, and this country has to do more to adapt.</p><p>\"Canada is experiencing more frequent and more extreme wildfires and unfortunately that is not going to get better,\" he said. \"This is a product of climate change and climate change that is baked into our future.\"</p><p>In the last two years, Public Safety Canada has been called on 14 times to help with out of control fires. In the five years before then, it was only needed four times.</p><p>Last summer, more than 4.3 million hectares were burned across the country, more than 1.5 times the 10 year average of 2.6 million.</p><p>Forecasters said Friday Canadians from B.C. to western Quebec can expect higher than average fire risks in June and July this year again.</p><p>Flooding is also a major risk, with more big flood events happening more frequently. Last week, floods had forced evacuations in Manitoba, Alberta, Northwest Territories and northwestern Ontario.</p><p>Until the 1960s, Canada marked about 30 climate-related disasters every decade. Now it's more than 100. </p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 16, 2022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-59f0cf602ddf4de086cd1d6c0eb40d5b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65FY-TN01-JBVR-30FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 16, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last November, the roads into the town were washed out by floods that caused $5 billion in estimated damage across British Columbia.</p><p>The winter then brought the largest snowfall to Lytton it had seen in more than three decades.</p><p>The expert panel on disaster resilience said by 2030 Canada should be able to show a measurable reduction in the number of Canadians exposed to danger from extreme weather, and be able to make every victim of a natural disaster \"whole again\" within one year.</p><p>Lytton is not the only Canadian town hit with disasters back to back. Last summer, Red Lake, Ont., and several nearby First Nations were hit with forest fires for the second year in a row, prompting evacuations and destroying thousands of hectares of land.</p><p>On May 10, the municipality 500 km northwest of Thunder Bay, declared a state of emergency because floods have washed out sections of the highway leading into town.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Friday at a news conference on forest fire preparations that no matter how successful Canadians are at cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of global warming are already upon us, and this country has to do more to adapt.</p><p>\"Canada is experiencing more frequent and more extreme wildfires and unfortunately that is not going to get better,\" he said. \"This is a product of climate change and climate change that is baked into our future.\"</p><p>In the last two years, Public Safety Canada has been called on 14 times to help with out of control fires. In the five years before then, it was only needed four times.</p><p>Last summer, more than 4.3 million hectares were burned across the country, more than 1.5 times the 10 year average of 2.6 million.</p><p>Forecasters said Friday Canadians from B.C. to western Quebec can expect higher than average fire risks in June and July this year again.</p><p>Flooding is also a major risk, with more big flood events happening more frequently. Last week, floods had forced evacuations in Manitoba, Alberta, Northwest Territories and northwestern Ontario.</p><p>Until the 1960s, Canada marked about 30 climate-related disasters every decade. Now it's more than 100.</p><p>\u2014Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press</p><p>RELATED: Climate change health costs to top $100B by mid-century: report</p><p>RELATED: British Columbians most worried about climate change nationally: poll</p><p>Copyright 2022 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20220516PAB4321775</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65G1-NYT1-JD2C-J1YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Group Ltd.

As a result, research and predictions tell us that by the end of this century wildfire activity will be doubled. As a part of the Fire &amp; Ice Series, Wildsight presents The Future of Fire with renowned author, educator, and public speaker Ed Struzik, at the Columbia Valley Centre on Sept. 17 at 7 p.m.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Struzik will talk about his book Dark Days at Noon: The Future of Fire. He\u2019ll discuss the many mistakes that have been made in the managing of fire in the past and what can be done better going forward to mitigate the damage, and how to use fire in some cases, to our advantage. Struzik is no stranger to bearing witness to this damage first-hand. </p><p>\u201cI have seen many forest fires from a distance on canoe and hiking trips. One fire that stood out was one that burned a good part of Kootenay National Park in 2003, just a few weeks before 45,000 people in the Okanagan were forced to evacuate because of another fire,\u201d said Struzik. \u201cI got a chance to get up close to that one in Kootenay with firefighters and fire specialists from Parks Canada. I had never seen anything like it. It was like a slow-moving freight train that almost made it into Banff where the old-growth forest went on forever. The town of Banff may have burned down in the height of the tourism season if the fire had spread into Banff. At times, the fire had its own mind, doing whatever it wanted to do, passing through natural fireguards without even slowing down.  </p><p>\u201cI remember Rob Walker, the fire and vegetation specialist for Parks Canada, telling me that this fire was a harbinger of future fires in a warming world. He was right, of course. But many people didn\u2019t get it at the time. And still don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>Events for Wildsight\u2019s Fire &amp; Ice series were designed with our community and geography in mind.  Struzik\u2019s eighth book Dark Days at Noon: The Future of Fire was a perfect fit. </p><p>\u201cThe book and its message are very relevant to the Columbia Valley,\u201d said Lianna Ferguson, program co-ordinator at Wildsight Invermere. \u201cThis valley is no stranger to wildfires. As the book synopsis says, as people continue to move into forested landscapes to work, play, live, and ignite fires \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 fire has begun to take its toll, burning entire towns, knocking out utilities, closing roads, and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.\u201d </p><p>Conducting the research for Dark Days at Noon was not for the faint of heart. Part of it entailed Struzik reading thousands of newspaper articles that had been published between 1870 and 2021. There have been many accounts of destruction and the displacement of people across the U.S. and Canada from 1870 to the early 1900s, including a forest fire that burned down the town of Fernie in 1908, which hits a little closer to home. </p><p>\u201cI was surprised by the large number of fires that burned so many towns and killed so many people on both sides of the border. I was amazed that many of these very destructive fires never made it into the history books,\u201d said Struzik. \u201cDeadly fires were a lot more common than I imagined. I wondered why and this is what I try to explain it in the book.\u201d </p><p>Dark Days at Noon warns of what may happen in the future if we do not learn to live with fire as the continent\u2019s Indigenous Peoples once did. Struzik writes an entire chapter that deals with Indigenous burning. </p><p>\u201cInterestingly, it was David Thompson who first recognized that indigenous people burned so that new grass would grow and attract bison, and that root vegetables and berries thrived after a burn,\u201d said Struzik. \u201cEuropeans refused to see the value in this light burning. They ended up kicking Indigenous people out of national parks and protected areas partly for that reason. The threat of severe deadly fires will grow as temperatures continue to rise. It\u2019s simple. The good news is that there are a lot of things that we can do about. I\u2019ll be talking about that in Invermere.\u201d </p><p>The issues that multi award-winning author Struzik will be discussing are relevant to all residents that live on the unceded territories of the Secw\u00e9pemc and Ktunaxa peoples and the land chosen as home by the M\u00e9tis peoples in the Columbia Valley.  Tickets for this event are $20 in advance or $25 at the door. To purchase your advance tickets visit wildsight.ca . For those that haven\u2019t yet read the book, Four Points Books will be selling copies of it at the event on Sept. 17 with a book signing to follow.  </p><p>\u201cOur hope is that residents lean into this conversation instead of shy away,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cFire is going to be a yearly event as fire is a necessary part of our landscape. Due to mismanagement of our forests thus far, paired with a changing climate, it is important that we learn to live with it. We hope the more information and understanding people have about fire, the better they can prepare, and hopefully live with less fear.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-185129e56eb34b1a86e9c99cf9a022c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66DM-5BK1-JBVR-3117-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><timeReceived>07:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 17, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of May 3 ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What we are watching in Canada ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canadians who served as military advisers in Afghanistan say many of their Afghan family members don't qualify to come to Canada, even though their lives are at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Canadian government recruited some 45 Canadian citizens with Afghan heritage to serve as language and cultural advisers during the mission in Afghanistan. They were granted top-secret security clearance and risked their lives to serve alongside soldiers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One adviser, who was given the military code name \"Sam,\" says his sister's family was threatened repeatedly by the Taliban over his involvement with the Canadian military and her husband was killed before she fled the country in 2018. </p><p>The Canadian Press is not revealing his real name because his sister is now at risk of being deported from Turkey back to Afghanistan.</p><p>Though the Canadian government recently created a program specifically to bring the families of people like Sam to safety, his sister doesn't qualify because she fled too early \u2014 before the Taliban took over the country.</p><p>\"I feel that the responsibility is on me because it happened because of me, you know, because of my involvement,\" said Sam, who lives in Ottawa.</p><p>The Immigration Department says it consulted a range of stakeholders on its approach to the program, and that family members must meet the eligibility criteria to qualify to come to Canada. </p><p>Sam and his former colleagues have spent years advocating on behalf of their families, contacting politicians of all stripes. They've shown up to parliamentary committee meetings, called constituency offices and written countless emails in hopes of bringing them to safety. </p><p>\"Psychologically, it's torturing me,\" Sam said.</p><p>A government has allowed a maximum of 380 principal applicants under the special program, which is expected to remain open until September. </p><p>Until then, Sam is desperately hoping his phone will ring and someone will be able to help him save his sister from further danger. </p><p>---</p><p>Also this ...</p><p>A program that for five decades has had young Canadians shadow MPs from across the political spectrum is facing an uncertain future because the model that has kept it running grates against modern labour codes and tax laws.</p><p>The Parliamentary Internship Programme brings 10 young professionals and recent university graduates onto Parliament Hill to shadow two MPs -- one from the sitting government and the other in opposition -- for 10 months</p><p>The interns help MPs with analysis and writing while also researching their own academic paper.</p><p>The program started in 1970 after a motion from a backbench MP called for the government to create a non-partisan program for young Canadians to learn about the parliamentary process and the role of MPs.</p><p>The House of Commons helps run the program with the Speaker as its patron. The Canadian Political Science Association is paid to operate the program using donations from sponsors and alumni. That follows a deliberate formula MPs designed in 1969 to avoid political interference from government and to ensure it was not reliant on public funds.</p><p>Last week, the association sent out a notice saying it's pulling out of the arrangement by the end of 2024 after a year of trying to find a workaround.</p><p>The program's tax status has become increasingly unclear because the interns don't qualify as receiving a scholarship but also are neither students nor full employees of the House of Commons.</p><p>They were at one time considered independent contractors, but that didn't align with the reality of having the program set their work hours and vacation dates while reimbursing expenses. </p><p>In 2020, the political science association converted the interns into employees so they would qualify for COVID-19 subsidies when Parliament Hill scaled down its work at the start of the pandemic.</p><p>Since then, the association has had to take on responsibility for human resources, but it only has partial say in which organizations can sponsor the program, and it argues that could put its reputation at risk.</p><p>It has proposed the House of Commons absorb the program \u2014 something that came as news to the Speaker's office, which called that a \"unilateral decision\" by the association's board.</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the U.S. ...</p><p>WASHINGTON _ U.S. and Mexican officials have agreed on new immigration policies meant to deter illegal border crossings while also opening up other pathways ahead of an expected increase in migrants following the end of pandemic restrictions next week.</p><p>Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall spent Tuesday meeting with Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and other top officials, emerging with a five-point plan, according to statements from both nations.</p><p>Under the agreement, Mexico will continue to accept migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua who are turned away at the border, and up to 100,000 individuals from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who have family in the U.S. will be eligible to live and work there.</p><p>Despite sharing a 3,140-kilometre border with the U.S., Mexico had been notably absent from the rollout last week of a fresh set of efforts, including the creation of hubs outside the United States where migrants could go to apply to legally settle in the U.S., Spain or Canada. The first centres will open in Guatemala and Colombia.</p><p>The COVID-19 restrictions have allowed U.S. officials to turn away tens of thousands of migrants crossing the southern border, but those restrictions will lift May 11, and border officials are bracing for a surge. Even with the restrictions, the administration has seen record numbers of people crossing the border, and President Joe Biden has responded by cracking down on those who cross illegally and by creating new avenues meant as alternatives to a dangerous and often deadly journey.</p><p>Mexico's support is critical to any push by the U.S. to clamp down at the southern border, particularly as migrants from nations from as far away as Haiti are making the trek on foot up through Mexico, and are not easily returned back to their home countries.</p><p>With Mexico now behind the U.S., plus an announcement Tuesday that 1,500 active-duty U.S. troops are deploying south for administrative support, and other crackdown measures in place, border officials believe they may be able to manage overcrowding and other possible issues that might arise once the COVID-19 restrictions end.</p><p>Biden, who announced his Democratic reelection campaign a week ago, is trying to signal his administration is making a serious effort to tamp down the number of illegal crossings, which has been a potent source of Republican attacks. He also is trying to send a message to potential border crossers not to attempt the journey.</p><p>But the effort also draws potentially unwelcome comparisons to Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, whose policies Biden frequently criticized. Congress, meanwhile, has refused to take any substantial immigration-related actions.</p><p>The U.S. will continue to turn away Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who cross illegally. Mexico said Tuesday it would continue to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries that are making up a ballooning share of the overall illegal border crossings, with no easy way to quickly return migrants to their home countries.</p><p>---</p><p>What we are watching in the rest of the world ...</p><p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates _ Economies across the Middle East and Central Asia will likely slow this year as persistently high inflation and rising interest rates bite into their post-pandemic gains, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday.</p><p>The IMF's Regional Economic Outlook blamed in part rising energy costs, as well as elevated food prices, for the estimated slower growth. The report said that while oil-dependent economies of the Gulf Arab states and others in the region have reaped the benefits of elevated crude prices, other countries _ such as Pakistan _ have seen growth collapse after an unprecedented flooding last summer or as economic woes worsened.</p><p>The regional slowdown also comes as an explosion of fighting in Sudan between two top rival generals _ who only a year ago as allies orchestrated a military coup that upended the African country's transition to democracy _ threatens a nation where IMF and World Bank debt relief remains on hold.</p><p>Rising interest rates, used by central banks worldwide to try to stem inflation's rise, increase the costs of borrowing money. That will affect nations carrying heavier debts, the IMF warned.</p><p>\"This year we're seeing inflation again being the most challenging issue for most of the countries,'' Jihad Azour, the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the IMF, told The Associated Press. \"For those who have high level of debt, the challenge of increase in interest rate globally, as well as also the tightening of monetary policy, is affecting them.''</p><p>The IMF forecast predicts regional growth will drop from 5.3 per cent last year to 3.1 per cent this year. Overall, regional inflation is expected to be at 14.8 per cent, unchanged from last year, as Russia's war on Ukraine continues to pressure global food supplies and affect energy markets.</p><p>It will be even worse in Pakistan, where the IMF projected inflation to more than double, to about 27 per cent. Pakistan and IMF officials have held repeated talks over the release of a stalled key tranche of a $6 billion bailout package loan to Islamabad.</p><p>The IMF warned that financial conditions worldwide will tighten this year, brought on in part by two bank failures in the United States in March. The sudden collapse of Credit Suisse before it was purchased by UBS also strained markets.</p><p>---</p><p>On this day in 2016 ...</p><p>A raging forest fire, whipped up by shifting winds, sliced through the middle of the northern oilsands capital of Fort McMurray, forcing all 80,000 residents to flee. More than 2,400 buildings were lost but firefighters managed to save almost 90 per cent of the city from destruction. The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimated the insured damage totalled $3.58 billion, by far the costliest insured disaster in Canadian history. (A phased re-entry for fire evacuees began on June 1.)</p><p>---</p><p>In entertainment ...</p><p>It was a relationship that lasted a lifetime: Gordon Lightfoot got his start at Massey Hall as a teenager, and never stopped returning to the Toronto venue, no matter how successful he became.  </p><p>Hundreds of famous musicians have played the stage in its long history, but none so often as Lightfoot. The folk legend and the concert hall fed off each other's fame, sharing a sort of symbiosis that spanned more than half a century. </p><p>\"It's a spiritual thing,\" Lightfoot told The Canadian Press in 2018. \"I have an affinity for Massey Hall that\u2019s very strong.\" </p><p>When the concert hall closed down for major renovations that same year, his was the last performance. And when it reopened three years later, he was the one to usher in its new era with three consecutive shows.</p><p>They would be his last at the venue before his death on Monday at age 84. </p><p>Jesse Kumagai, president and CEO of Massey Hall, said the venue is mourning the loss of its most frequent performer. Lightfoot took to the stage more than 170 times over the course of his career, starting when he was just 13 years old.</p><p>Kumagai described seeing Lightfoot in concert at Massey Hall as the quintessential Canadian experience.</p><p>---</p><p>Did you see this?</p><p>Countries around the world whose currencies pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II now have a new monarch \u2014 and a decision to make about whether the King has a place on their money.</p><p>Since the queen's death in September, Canada has stayed mum on whether or not it intends to put the King's likeness on its coins and bills. </p><p>But other members of the Commonwealth have moved more quickly towards enshrining his visage on their cash \u2014 or instead moving away from any kind of royal tribute. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the United Kingdom was the first country to move forward with new banknotes that will feature King Charles, unveiling the designs in December. </p><p>The Bank of England says the new banknotes will come into circulation in mid-2024. </p><p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand also said after the queen's death that it would be preparing to change out the image it uses on coins for one approved by the new King. It said the transition would take several years. </p><p>Australia went in the other direction, deciding not to place King Charles on its new five-dollar bill. Its central bank announced in February that the country was opting for an Indigenous design instead. </p><p>But the King is still expected to appear on Australian coins that currently bear the image of Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>In the Caribbean, many countries have been contending with conversations on what role the monarchy should play. Barbados, for example, ditched the British monarch as its head of state in 2021. </p><p>Other Caribbean nations that still belong to the Commonwealth have said little about whether King Charles will be depicted on their banknotes and coins. </p><p>However, the Antigua Observer reported earlier this year that the governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Timothy NJ Antoine, said there may be \"no appetite\" for that. </p><p>According to the Royal Canadian Mint, Canada has included a likeness of the reigning monarch on its coins since it started production in 1908. </p><p>---</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-631a2e6abe5a4938a797cb122a0f316c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6851-HV31-DY9S-T54W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2260\"/><timeReceived>04:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 3, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In a new MEI paper, he recommends a series of policy actions that both the central bank and the federal government can undertake to help alleviate the negative effects of this expansionary policy on the population and ensure the economic health of the country.</p><p>\"If the central bank does not allow more market-driven interest rates, adverse consequences will follow. At this moment, we are facing several problems such as housing affordability, resource misallocation, and rising debt, all due in part to very low interest rates over a long period,\" observes Jerome Gessaroli.</p><p>While raising interest rates is part of the solution, it is not the whole solution.Interest rates are a blunt tool, so using them can have suboptimal outcomes. \"Interest rate policy is like a dull scalpel that a surgeon uses to remove an appendix. The surgeon may get the job done, but the patient will suffer ragged tissue cuts, greater blood loss, more likely infection, and scarring,\" explains Jerome Gessaroli.</p><p>There is no short-term magic bullet to get back on track quickly, but there must be a return to budgetary discipline, and interest rates must not be kept artificially low as they have been for some time now.</p><p>\"The government needs to rediscover fiscal discipline, combining cuts to discretionary consumption expenditures and productivity enhancing policies in order to get back on a sustainable fiscal path. Households, companies, and governments have taken on too much debt, and productivity growth has slowed, as has wage growth. Both monetary and fiscal measures will be required to right the ship,\" concludes Jerome Gessaroli.</p><p>Six recommendations:</p><p> Reduce the Bank's influence on interest ratesIt is important to realize that monetary policy can take up to two years before its full effects are felt in the economy. If inflation is not transitory, continued ultra low interest rates and quantitative easing, along with planned government stimulus spending, could be the equivalent of air dropping gasoline on a forest fire.Show fiscal disciplineThe federal government's debt-to-GDP ratio should be reduced by slowing the growth of spending, primarily in discretionary consumption programs rather than capital and infrastructure projects.Pursue economic growth policiesPolicies that improve growth and productivity enable the economy to escape the debt trap, and to alleviate distortions from continuous low interest rates. The country's productivity and competitiveness could be improved by reducing the regulatory burden and reviewing the tax system.Lengthen the maturity term of government issued bondsThe federal government should take advantage of current low interest rates and finance its borrowing requirements by issuing more long-dated bonds.Make monetary policy more symmetricalGoing forward, the Bank of Canada should ease and tighten monetary policy in approximately equal proportion.Favour resiliency rather than stability in the financial systemPolicies should allow the financial system to expand and contract based on economic signals, yet still be able to provide its key functions in times of significant stress.</p><p>To read the full publication, click here:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iedm.org/wpcontent/uploads/2022/03/cahier02-2022_en.pdf\">https://www.iedm.org/wpcontent/uploads/2022/03/cahier02-2022_en.pdf</url></p><p>The Montreal Economic Institute is an independent public policy think tank.

Last year was one of the hottest and smokiest in memory in Northwestern Ontario. </p><p>According to the TSB report, the helicopter\u2019s pilot and lone occupant had been returning to the Nipigon fire base after spending the better part of the afternoon making 45 drops of water on a forest fire. A bucket suspended from the chopper by a line about 45 metres long contained about 2,000 litres of water. </p><p>While 500 metres above the ground, the report said, the pilot heard a \u201cvibration and grinding noise\u201d in the tail rotor area. </p><p>\u201cThe helicopter yawed to the right and the nose began to pitch down,\u201d the report said. \u201cAs the helicopter began to spin, the pilot released the line and water bucket by kicking the manual cargo release pedal.\u201d </p><p>The unidentified pilot, who according to the report was experienced and well-rested prior to the flight, issued a mayday call to let other pilots in the area know that he was about to crash, the report said. </p><p>\u201cWhile the helicopter was descending at approximately 1,000 to 1,500 fpm (feet per minute), the pilot made three attempts to use some engine power to fly the helicopter to a suitable landing area near a small lake,\u201d the report said </p><p>The aircraft crashed on its side around 7:30 p.m. in a boggy area. Though the pilot was severely injured and the chopper badly damaged, he managed to switch off the engines before exiting the opposite cockpit door. There was no fire, the report said.  </p><p>The pilot was rescued \u201cwithin a few minutes\u201d by another helicopter with firefighters on board, and taken to hospital in Thunder Bay. </p><p>In its report about the incident, the TSB noted that prior to the crash, \u201cseveral daily inspections had been carried out (on the helicopter) before the occurrence flight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d the report said, a daily inspection check sheet in use at that time by the (aircraft\u2019s owner) did not call for an inspection of tail rotor driveshaft coupling assemblies.\u201d </p><p>\u201cImmediately following the occurrence, Helicopter Transport Services Canada grounded its three remaining Bell 214STs pending inspections of each helicopter\u2019s complete tail rotor drivetrain to verify correct installation,\u201d the report said. </p><p>\u201cA memo was distributed to all pilots reminding them about ensuring sufficient airspeed to maintain helicopter control during an emergency involving the tail rotor, or a total loss of tail rotor thrust in cruise flight,\u201d the report added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-df01975c896f4aeb99ae6e8843d0f0ea</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RP-SDC1-JBVR-3371-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><timeReceived>09:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 9, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As Canada works towards recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in our airports continue to be crucial to maintain the safety and security of our transportation sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is investing more than $1.7 million in the Prince George Airport through Transport Canada's Airport Relief Fund to help it maintain important airport operations and essential air services for residents and workers in Prince George and surrounding communities.</p><p>The Prince George Airport also received over $1.4 million from Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program for the purchase of a 4x4 snowplow truck and a wet/dry material spreader. This equipment will help the airport maintain safe operations for aircraft, passengers, crews and airport workers by keeping runways and taxiways clear of snow and ice. The funding will also support the expansion of a shelter to house and protect the airport's aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicle from the elements, ensuring it is ready for immediate use in case of an emergency.</p><p>These investments are in addition to the over $1.4 million in Airports Capital Assistance Program funding provided to the airport in May 2021 for the purchase of an aircraft rescue firefighting vehicle and a runway ice sweeper.</p><p> Quotes</p><p>\"As we move forward with the safe and gradual return of air travel, it is our government's priority to ensure a vibrant and competitive Canadian air sector that keeps travellers and workers safe. These critical investments will allow the Prince George Airport to have the infrastructure and tools needed to help re-invigorate the aviation industry in the communities it serves, and allow Canadians to feel safe and secure when they travel.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar AlghabraMinister of Transport</p><p> Quick FactsFirst introduced in the 2020 Fall Economic Statement, the Airport Relief Fund is part of a federal stimulus recovery plan designed to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient economy post-COVID-19.The Airport Relief Fund, launched in May 2021, provided $64.8 million in funding in 2021-2022 for targeted airports whose 2019 revenues were less than $250 million.As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.The eligible National Airports System airports are: Gander; Charlottetown; Saint John; Fredericton; Moncton; Thunder Bay; London; and Prince George.Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country.

English star Jimmy Fryatt was one of them. He was considered one of the best at heading the ball. Researchers say the practice is dangerous and should be phased out, especially for children. The new diagnoses come as soccer officials gather in Chicago for a Head Injury Summit.

The warnings ended about an hour later, but not before people took to social media to share images of darkened skies, lightning and ominous cloud patterns spotted in some parts of the province.</p><p>June is bringing with it unseasonably wild weather and temperature fluctuations across the globe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hailstorm in Mexico in June</emphasis></p><p>Mexico City was blanketed with soft hail, that resembled snow, on June 12 and left residents scrambling in the aftermath of the sudden hailstorm.</p><p>The hailstorm formed a thick sludge over the Mexican capital and made it difficult to move freely as motorists were seen stuck with their vehicles after a thick blanket of ice reportedly formed over roads. Walking around was tricky as well, as pedestrians tried to carefully navigate the slippery streets still dressed in clothing more suited for a sunny day.</p><p>Environment Canada meteorologist David Phillips said Mexico City's landscape looked like it was in the middle of January rather than June.</p><p>Phillips said it was more of a freak hailstorm than a typical weather occurrence.</p><p>\"Mexico City is a very high elevation city. Its elevation is 2,240 metres. It's almost more than twice the height above sea level than Calgary which elevation is 1,045 metres,\" said Phillips.</p><p>High elevation means high altitude and cooler clouds that can produce ice balls that become frozen as strong winds pick it up. \"(The) distance it falls changes its form from ice to snow to rain,\" said Phillips.</p><p>Mexico's wet season is from June to September, that's when they get most of their cloudy weather, said Phillips.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Extreme heat in the U.S.</emphasis></p><p>The National Weather Service Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said Monday 107.5 million people will be affected by combination of heat advisories, excessive heat warnings and excessive heat watches through Wednesday.</p><p>St. Louis, Memphis, Minneapolis and Tulsa are among several cities under excessive heat warnings, with temperatures forecast to reach about 38 C accompanied by high humidity that could make conditions feel closer to 43 C.</p><p>\"I think that's the thing that is quite impressive, there are just millions and millions of Americans that are feeling like these are like the dog days of summer in mid-June and you don't normally expect these kinds of extremes until July and in August,\" said Phillips.</p><p>A large section of the U.S. is experiencing record temperatures over an extensive area, Phillips said, adding the extreme heat has started forest fire season very early, and described it as \"one of the worst seasons on record so far.\"</p><p>\"Most of the heat and humidity comes from the American Southwest. They're experiencing the warm summery weather and our turn will come and it won't be too far away,\" said Phillips.</p><p>Excessive heat warnings and watches stretch as far north as Wisconsin down to the Florida Panhandle on the Gulf Coast.</p><p>In May, three women died in a senior housing facility after a sudden and deadly heat wave gripped Chicago last month.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canadian Weather</emphasis></p><p>This side of the border, Environment Canada is calling for heavy rain and strong winds for provinces like Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.</p><p>Parts of the Alberta Rockies saw an unseasonable amount of snowfall this week.</p><p>Frost advisories have been issued for parts of Newfoundland and Labrador that will begin overnight and last until early Thursday morning. Temperatures will hover around 0 to a high of 5 C. The weather agency warns that frost may damage some crops in frost-prone areas.</p><p>Extreme thunderstorm warnings and calls for possible nickel-sized hail have ended for parts of Southern Ontario.</p><p>Daytime temperatures for the province are expected to reach 30 to 33 C, feeling closer to 40 C with humidity. \"Hot and humid conditions will persist into Thursday,\" reads Environment Canada's forecast.</p><p>Ontario should expect some relief from the heat Thursday evening.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With files from Ivy Mak and The Associated Press</emphasis></p><p>Dorcas Marfo is a reporter for the Star's radio room based in Toronto.

That would also be applicable for Township of Spallumcheen residents.</p><p>The exact timing of the planned burn will depend on weather and site conditions. The planned ignition was a no-go Thursday, Aug. 26, due to winds. If and when site conditions are favourable, additional information will be provided prior to ignition.</p><p>The recent and forecasted cooler weather with periods of rain has been assessed to ensure optimum conditions are present for a successfully planned burn event.</p><p>BC Wildfire crews completed a series of small-scale burns on the south and northeast flanks of the White Rock Lake wildfire which began Tuesday, a day ahead of schedule. According to BC Wildfire Service, crews continue to extinguish deep burning fuels that are persistent throughout the east flank and are making good progress on mop-up and patrol activities along the south, west and northern flanks.</p><p>The ignition was critical to securing the area east of the larger-scale planned ignition set to occur in the coming week.</p><p>Planned ignitions were used to secure the fire perimeter burning north of Terrace Mountain yesterday, Aug 25, and west towards the fire perimeter above Shorts Creek (along the southeast flank). The aerial ignitions removed approximately 600-hectares of fuel between the fire's edge and the pre-established control line.</p><p>The controlled burn was determined to be the best tactic in fighting the forest fire in the Irish Creek Road and Six Mile Creek area due to the steep and inaccessible terrain and the continued safety of firefighters.</p><p>READ MORE: Military on the move from Oliver to Vernon to combat White Rock Lake wildfire</p><p>READ MORE: VIDEO: Injured White Rock Lake firefighter arrives at Vernon airport</p><p>@VernonNews</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:roger@vernonmorningstar.com\">roger@vernonmorningstar.com</email></p><p>Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Keremeos Review</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KEMREV-news20210826PKE4204941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KEMREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63G2-1WD1-F0HF-81RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438251</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"356\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

(Troilus or the Company) reports additional assay results from Zone X22 at the gold-copper Troilus Project, located in northcentral Quebec, Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These results further demonstrate strong continuity between previously drilled holes and continue to highlight the high-grade trends of this zone (see plan view in Figure 1 and sections in Figures 2 and 3).</p><p>The reported results form part of a definition drill program targeting the high-grade NE-SW deformation corridor that characterizes the X22 Zone. An additional ~4,000 metres focused on infill drilling are planned in order to meet the Indicated resource category spacing requirement.</p><p>All results reported lie entirely outside of the PEA pit shells, excluding hole X22-23-026, and are intended to be included in the upcoming mineral resource estimate and Feasibility Study.</p><p>Zone X22 Intercept Highlights: //st * Hole X22-23-042 intersected a high-grade interval of 103.81 g/t AuEq over 1m, as well as 1.09 g/t AuEq over 45m within a broader intersection of 0.83 g/t AuEq over 82m, extending mineralization down-dip by 100m with hole X22-23-069, which returned 0.73 g/t AuEq over 55m, including 5.35 AuEq over 1m (see Figure 3). Mineralization remains open to expansion at depth. * Hole X22-23-067 intersected 14.68 g/t AuEq over 7m, including 133.12 g/t AuEq over 0.7m * Hole X22-23-066 intersected 3.29 g/t AuEq over 11m, including 24.56 g/t AuEq over 1m and 3.10 g/t AuEq over 17m, including 7.26 g/t AuEq over 3m extending mineralization 50m down-dip from previously reported hole 87-22-446 (see Figure 2). * Hole X22-23-044 returned 5.03 g/t AuEq over 3m, including 10.17 g/t AuEq over 1m extending mineralization 50m down-dip of hole X22-23-066 and remains open to expansion at depth (see Figure 2). * Hole X22-23-057 drilled 2.75 g/t AuEq over 2.4m at surface and 1.38 g/t AuEq over 12m, including 4.94 g/t AuEq over 1m confirming mineral continuity 100m down-dip from previously reported hole 87-22-410 and 50m up-dip from previously hole X22-23-023 (see Figure 2).</p><p>Justin Reid, CEO of Troilus Gold, commented, Drilling in Zone X22 continues to impress us, returning some of the highest grades and most continuous intercepts in Troilus history. We strongly believe that our drilling efforts at X22 will optimize an already strong project, with near-surface high grades that will enhance the mines strip ratio and positively impact the mine sequencing. Significant recent rainfall in Quebec has provided some relief to the forest fire situation in the Eeyou-Istchee James Bay region and operations at our site are slowly re-starting since receiving government approval to access our camp. We expect to ramp up and resume drilling and exploration activities in the coming week as we closely monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our staff and local communities.</p><p>The northeastern most region of X22 is showcasing strong grades and mineral continuity near surface. Wide intervals of mineralization such as 0.83 g/t AuEq of 82m from hole X22-23-042 are characterized by pervasive biotite alteration with disseminated sulfides, as well as sericitized shear zones and felsic porphyry dykes. High-grade intercepts such as 103.81 g/t AuEq from X22-23-042 are characterized by more discrete structures containing semi-massive pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. The strategic execution of the X22 drill program has rapidly expanded and defined the mineralized trend, which now extends ~1 kilometre and is expected to have a positive impact on the economics in the upcoming Feasibility Study, which remains on schedule for targeted completion prior to the end of the 2023 calendar year.</p><p>Figure 1: Plan View Map of Zone X22 Showing Current and Previously

with available information.</p><p>Quality Assurance and Control</p><p>During the Zone X22 drill program, one meter assay samples were taken from NQ core and sawed in half. One-half was sent for assaying at ALS Laboratory, a certified commercial laboratory, and the other half was retained for results, cross checks, and future reference. A strict QA/QC program was applied to all samples, which included insertion of one certified mineralized standard and one blank sample in each batch of 25 samples. Every sample was processed with standard crushing to 85% passing 75 microns on 500 g splits. Samples were assayed by one-AT (30 g) fire assay with an AA finish and if results were higher than 3.5 g/t Au, assays were redone with a gravimetric finish. For QA/QC samples, a 50 g fire assay was done. In addition to gold, ALS laboratory carried out multi-element analysis for ME-ICP61 analysis of 33 elements four acid ICP-AES.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical and scientific information in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Nicolas Guest, P.Geo., Senior Project Geologist, who is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Guest is an employee of Troilus and is not independent of the Company under NI 43-101.</p><p>About Troilus Gold Corp.</p><p>Troilus Gold Corp. is a Canadian-based junior mining company focused on the systematic advancement and de-risking of the former gold and copper Troilus Mine towards production. From 1996 to 2010, the Troilus Mine produced +2 million ounces of gold and nearly 70,000 tonnes of copper. Troilus is located in the top-rated mining jurisdiction of Quebec, Canada, where is holds a strategic land position of 1,420 km in the Frtet-Evans Greenstone Belt. Since acquiring the project in 2017, ongoing exploration success has demonstrated the tremendous scale potential of the gold system on the property with significant mineral resource growth. The Company is advancing engineering studies following the completion of a robust PEA in 2020, which demonstrated the potential for the Troilus project to become a top-ranked gold and copper producing asset in Canada. Led by an experienced team with a track-record of successful mine development, Troilus is positioned to become a cornerstone project in North America.</p><p>For more information:</p><p>Caroline Arsenault</p><p>VP Corporate Communications</p><p>+1 (647) 407-7123</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@troilusgold.com\">info@troilusgold.com</email></p><p>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information</p><p>Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability; the estimate of Mineral Resources in the updated Mineral Resource statement may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. There is no certainty that the Indicated Mineral Resources will be converted to the Probable Mineral Reserve category, and there is no certainty that the updated Mineral Resource statement will be realized.</p><p>The PEA is preliminary in nature, includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The PEA is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See below and the Companys latest technical report available on SEDAR for more information with respect to the key assumptions, parameters, methods and risks of determination associated with the foregoing.</p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the impact of the ongoing drill program and results on the Company, the possible economics of the project and the Companys understanding of the project; the development potential and timetable of the project; the estimation of mineral resources; realization of mineral resource estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future exploration; the anticipated results of the Companys ongoing 2023 drill program and their possible impact on the potential size of the mineral resource estimate; costs of future activities; capital and operating expenditures; success of exploration activities; the anticipated ability of investors to continue benefiting from the Companys low discovery costs, technical expertise and support from local communities. Generally, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as plans, expects or does not expect, is expected, budget, scheduled, estimates, forecasts, intends, continue, anticipates or does not anticipate, or believes, or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results may, could, would, will, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are made based upon certain assumptions and other important facts that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Troilus to be materially different from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Troilus will operate in the future. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of Troilus to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: there being no assurance that the exploration program will result in expanded mineral resources; risks and uncertainties inherent to mineral resource estimates; the impact the COVID 19 pandemic may have on the Companys activities (including without limitation on its employees and suppliers) and the economy in general; the impact of the recovery post COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on gold and other metals; the receipt of necessary approvals; general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; future prices of mineral prices; accidents, labour disputes and shortages; environmental and other risks of the mining industry, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties discussed in the most recent Technical Report and in other continuous disclosure documents of the Company available under the Companys profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>. Although Troilus has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Troilus does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2023 Market News Publishing Inc.

Here are a few things to know about Mississauga's speed cameras, including their locations.<br/><br/> Timeline<br/><br/> Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year. </p><p><br/><br/> City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the roll-out of the program.<br/><br/> In May, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of 2021.<br/><br/> The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5 in 2021 with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods. <br/><br/> City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.<br/><br/> As of Friday, April 28, 16 speed cameras were active, according to the city.<br/><br/> Tickets<br/><br/> City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually. <br/><br/> According to a Mississauga press release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021. <br/><br/> In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor Colin Patterson wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.<br/><br/> As of June 3, the city reported that 8,258 tickets have been issued in total for the program but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.<br/><br/> During that time approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.<br/><br/> At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022. <br/><br/> Where are the cameras?<br/><br/> Active Speed Cameras<br/><br/> Aquinas Avenue, between Sebastian Drive and Long Acre Drive in Ward 8.

In British Columbia, shifting wind patterns have been a key concern for crews battling a fire in the south Okanagan that has forced the evacuation of hundreds of homes. Mary-Ann Jenkins, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at York University in Toronto, said fire generally moves in the same direction the wind is blowing. But mountains can complicate matters, she said. </p><p>The Rockies, for instance, influence a range of factors, including humidity and localized wind directions. \u201cBecause of the Rockies, wind can be channelled through valleys. It changes \u2014 the wind over ridges in the mountains and also sometimes you have very severe downslope winds,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd another thing that people don\u2019t know is that winds going up a hill tend to accelerate. As they go uphill, they get stronger and stronger before they reach the top.\u201d Jenkins said the Rockies create a unique phenomenon called Chinook winds, which are extremely drying, can be experienced all year around and can add to firefighting woes. \u201cThe weather conditions at the local level in a mountainous region are difficult to forecast. Because there are so many things that can happen due to topography.\u201d Such unpredictability has been felt acutely around Keremeos, in British Columbia\u2019s south Okanagan. The area\u2019s Indigenous name is \u201cvalley of the three winds,\u201d said Tim Roberts, the elected regional director. On Monday, BC Wildfire Service information officer Bryan Zandberg said winds around the Keremeos Creek fire were light, at about 15 kilometres per hour, which allowed firefighters to make good progress building containment lines. But the winds still had the potential to push flames south toward the villages of Keremeos and Olalla, as happened last week, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re making really good gains,\u201d he said, but added \u201cif the wind picks up, you know, the wind could take it where it wants to.\u201d More than 500 homes in the area have been ordered evacuated since the wildfire was reported on July 29. It\u2019s not just the western side of the country where unpredictable winds can be a factor. In Newfoundland, where a state of emergency was called over the weekend in response to a major fire, changing wind patterns have been making the situation difficult to handle. The blaze that began in an area called Paradise Lake was within 25 kilometres of the town of Grand Falls-Windsor, and crews were working Monday afternoon to build a fire break to keep the flames from creeping closer to the town, said Jeff Motty, the province\u2019s forest fire duty officer. In the Northwest Territories, meanwhile, authorities are guarding against a flare-up of a fire on the west side of Marian Lake that had previously been dormant underground. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources said heavy winds from the south were expected to cause extreme fire behaviour and significant growth of the so-called \u201czombie fire,\u201d which has grown to about 65 square kilometres. Prof. Mike Flannigan from Thompson Rivers University said the ingredients for a wildfire include fuel such as grasses and other vegetation, hot and dry weather and winds. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t even have to be hot, but it has to be dry and windy to fan a fire, said the British Columbia Research Chair in predictive services, emergency management and fire science. \u201cOnce you have a fire started, wind is also really important in how that spreads,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt spreads in the direction that the wind is going. So a west wind means the fire is moving from west to east, and it\u2019s most intense in the direction of the wind. It\u2019s like being pushed along by that wind.\u201d Usually when temperatures drop at night, humidity goes down and winds calm too, he said. But lately, he said researchers have found nights are staying warm, winds aren\u2019t \u201cpossibly\u201d calming as much as they used to, making it challenging for firefighters. Jenkins said fires also tend to make their own winds because they can create a large convective storm. A fire can produce a vortex of swirling air along a fire line, she said. Pressure is sucked out of these whirls, which can move erratically, and aren\u2019t easy to observe or predict, she said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re fairly benign, but sometimes they\u2019re not,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cIt spreads fire in a very erratic way and it can take out houses that you didn\u2019t expect, or overwhelm firefighters.\u201d Flannigan said that fires create hot air that rises, and a void that is filled with a stream of cold air. \u201cThe more quickly it does that, the stronger the winds are,\u201d he said. \u201cWind is just the movement of air. Fires create their own wind field and the bigger the fire, the more intense the fire, the stronger the wind.\u201d Even at the scale of a small bonfire, Jenkins said fires create their own winds. \u201cSo, larger fires do very, very interesting things with a degree of magnitude and are fairly more dangerous. That\u2019s a natural aspect of combustion, fuel burning, a wildfire burning.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20220810PTEA0002895787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664F-VSR1-JD2C-J3N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

The bulletin indicates most of the staff housed there will be dealing with fires that have been impacting highway travel in the area.</p><p>The Yukon has 25 three-person initial attack crews from the territory and 18 initial attack crews from B.C. working to halt the spread of fires, according to the latest numbers from Yukon Wildland Fire Management. Five 20-person unit crews from B.C. and one Yukon First Nations Wildfire unit crew, four airtanker groups, 36 helicopters and a B.C. incident management team are also working to keep fires at bay.</p><p>Fire information officer Haley Ritchie of Yukon Wildland Fire Management explained that on the front lines of the Two Buttes fire, a relatively small four-hectare fire located southeast of Mayo, two crews were dropped off by helicopter in an area that had been doused with rain and was smouldering over the weekend.</p><p>Workers spent hours scoping out the perimeter of the fire searching for hot spots, such as heat and smoke, and using hand tools to dig those out in order to ensure they are extinguished so the fire does not reactivate and spread if it dries out again.</p><p>Other crews in other regions have pump systems in addition to hand tools to deal with fires.</p><p>\"Rain has taken down a lot of fire activity, but our crews are still busy working and doing their jobs and getting things under control,\" Ritchie said.</p><p>Ritchie said weather has had a \"huge impact\" on the fire situation.</p><p>\"That very dry, hot, stormy weather pattern that was holding and causing so much trouble over the last week has broken up,\" she said.</p><p>\"Now we have a lower pressure system that's bringing pretty widespread rain, which is really helping to control fire activity \u2014 to keep that down and give us time to catch up and get a lot of those fires under control or out.\"</p><p>The recent precipitation has brought down the fire danger ratings in much of the region, as of the morning of July 13.</p><p>A July 13 bulletin advises the level two fire restriction that went into effect June 29 is being rescinded as a result of decreased fire activity and cooler, wetter conditions.</p><p>Despite the general levelling of fire threats across the board, Ritchie cautioned that it will take a lot of sustained rain to put out the risk.</p><p>\"We're not quite out of the woods yet,\" she said.</p><p>An evacuation alert remains in place for Stewart Crossing due to wildfires.</p><p>The Silver Trail and surrounding areas, including Mayo, Keno, Elsa, Moose Creek Lodge and Victoria Gold Mine are no longer under an evacuation alert, as of the afternoon of July 12.</p><p>The Canadian Red Cross took over registration for emergency social services on July 8. Information officer Kara Johancsik of the Yukon's Health Emergency Operations Centre said July 12 that Canadian Red Cross can be reached at 1-800-863-6582 for assistance with evacuations.</p><p>Ritchie said B.C.'s incident management team has taken over the battle with two fires that are still active but are not growing as quickly as before in the Crystal Creek area. Their goal is to protect the travel corridor along the North Klondike Highway, which reopened July 11 between Pelly Crossing and Stewart Crossing after being closed for a week due to fires and accompanying smoke.</p><p>Ritchie said the heat from the fires can stick around for an extended period of time, thus crews are working on \"shoring that up\" to prevent highway closures.</p><p>Ritchie is reminding residents and visitors to be mindful by treating crews working beside the highway as if it were a construction site.</p><p>Contact Dana Hatherly at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com\">dana.hatherly@yukon-news.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2022 Yukon News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20220712IYN4345617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65X8-PK01-JD2C-J4GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

That's because winds have pushed the wildfire smoke from Quebec and northeastern Ontario to southern Ontario and the GTA. <br/><br/> Earlier in the week, Toronto saw northwesterly winds, bringing in smoke from fires burning in northern Ontario, explained Phillips. <br/><br/> But later in the week, \"we're going to see the winds shift more to the east and that's a concern because it's going to take the smoke from the Quebec fires, which are much more prevalent right now, and move it through Eastern Ontario, and down through the GTA,\" he continued.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The Toronto Zoo is reducing its hours on Thursday, operating from 9:30 am to 3 pm.

Forester and Resource Land Manager Terri Hall is one of those people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Rayonier was my first permanent job after graduating from college. I started working for Rayonier in 1989 in the old Chandlery Building in downtown Fernandina. At that time, it was known as ITTRayonier, Corporate was in Connecticut and the timberlands were primarily in Florida and Georgia.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Rayonier's timberlands span across the Southeast from South Carolina to Texas, and in Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest as well as forests in New Zealand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Terri soon found her home in Rayonier's Florida Resource Unit, our team based in Rayonier's southernmost forests in Florida.</p><p>\"I started in Technical Services, then worked for the Florida region as a timber sales forester. Since 1992, I have had 5 different job titles but my office for all of them has been right here at the Bradford Forest Office.\"</p><p>If that isn't extraordinary enough, her boss has been with her for the span of her career. Rick Piagno, a colleague who eventually became her boss in 1996, is still her boss and Resource Unit Leader today.</p><p>\"So I've had the same boss for 26 years and have worked for the same company for 32 years!\" she chuckled.</p><p>Forging a career path all her own</p><p>Many foresters have a family background in the profession or some previous experience, but not Terri. She chose this career based on her own goals and objectives.</p><p>\"I had no experience and no family background, I just wanted a job that was not going to be boring. I didn't want to be stuck behind a desk all day long, and I wanted variety in my line of work. I definitely have variety. We always say: don't make too hard of plans because every morning things are likely to change.\"</p><p>Terri studied hard to earn her forestry education. She holds a Bachelors and Masters degree from Auburn University. Yet, she still encounters many misconceptions about her field of expertise.</p><p>\"When I say I'm a forester, people think I sit in a fire tower. So I get to explain all that's involved, from site management to seed selection, planting, disease control, working with loggers, fire fighting, sampling and statistics. People don't realize all that goes into the education and daily work of it all.\"</p><p>Terri began when few women worked directly in the field</p><p>Terri says it never concerned her that she was one of only a few women foresters. Nor did it motivate her to approach her job or make career decisions any differently.</p><p>\"When I went to school there were 3 other women in my forestry classes. When I began working I think there was - I don't really pay attention to this - no, there were not any other field women when I came. Then a couple more did come on but most of them did not stay in the field, they went into specialized things like technical services, GIS or research. I don't know of many who were actually in forest management.</p><p>\"I've never had a problem though. The nice thing about forestry is everyone is so great. Whether it's Rayonier employees, contractors, loggers or employees with the Florida Forest Service, everyone's just good, down-to-earth people. I've loved every minute of it. Honestly, unless somebody pointed out that I was one of the only women around, I never paid attention to it.\"</p><p>A day in life of this Rayonier forester</p><p>In December 2021, when Rayonier employee Robert Hall shadowed Terri for a day and took the photos included in this story, she and her team were dealing with seasonal planting. She began her day in the field supervising planting and taking plots.</p><p>\"In this picture, I'm laying out my pole to measure it for the correct length for a 35th-acre plot. I then swing the pole and count the seedlings on the plot.\"</p><p>Terri has to count the number of trees to ensure the contractor is planting the correct density. \"Planting compliance is complicated. Planting density can be affected by so many factors including bedding width, quality of the site prep and weather conditions. Really, the only thing a planter can control is how far apart the trees are in the bed.\"</p><p>Back at the office, there are forest fire maps to review and analyze</p><p>\"We do a lot of work looking at fire protection and things we can do to reduce fire danger, especially in Florida. Sometimes that's through release work, in which we chemically spray under the trees to reduce competition. You create a map of all the stands to show what areas need a reduction in fire danger. After evaluating the map, we make plans for the coming year to do activities in these high risk areas such as mowing or spraying to mitigate the danger.\"</p><p>Next, it's on to timber sales - of which Terri has 21 pending for Bradford County</p><p>This involves checking in on and meeting with the loggers every 10 days to make sure harvesting is going according to plan.</p><p>\"When I go out there, my biggest concerns are: stumps being low and trees being cut to the right top diameter so they're getting proper utilization of the trees. Also, I check that the roads are not being torn up, no oil spills, that the right area's being cut - you'd be surprised what can happen! - and that they only use our designated crossings. Since it rains a lot in Florida and we're so close to the water table, we're also very concerned about soil disturbance and wood not being left on the ground.\"</p><p>\"So I go to the field every week to check on the loggers and walk the timber sale area, making sure they haven't messed up any sites, channels or roads and ensure they have what they need. I try to maintain a good working relationship with the loggers where they feel free to call and tell me what they need whether it is road work, additional tickets or clarification of the sale area.\"</p><p>Now, she moves on to overseeing planting and nursery inventory</p><p>\"Whenever the planting crew works on my forests, I give them maps showing the planting area, number of acres, species to be planted, the seed lot number and the trees per acre to be planted. One of the most challenging things about planting season is getting the seedlings from the nursery to the field when the planters need them. It is a huge coordinated effort when the forests in different states are all planting at once and getting their trees from our one nursery in Elberta, Alabama.\"</p><p>The seedlings are delivered in refrigerated vans which are left on-site. When that inventory runs low, it's up to Terri to ensure they have a new van of seedlings on the way so planting isn't interrupted or delayed.</p><p>With the seedlings taken care of, Terri checks on the health of the larger tree stands</p><p>No matter how well you plan, cultivate and care for them, some trees are bound to experience pest pressure and/or disease. A regular part of Terri's work includes evaluating trees for early signs of trouble.</p><p>\"When you find a spot in a stand where the pine needles are turning red, you look for evidence like pitch tubes, popcorn or sawdust to try and identify the forest pest. Once you figure out the pest, you have to decide on a course of action. For example, if it's southern pine beetle, we know that pest travels fast! So you might have to cut them down plus create a buffer around them to capture the red, dead and dying. This creates a buffer to protect the healthy trees. So when we see dead spots we have to look at them and see what's going on.\"</p><p>This level of consistent observation is critical to preserving and maintaining healthy forests and wildlife habitats.</p><p>What Terri loves most about being a forester</p><p>Terri's love and passion for her work comes through in everything she does. Here's what she loves most about her job.</p><p>\"Some of it has to do with the actual work and some of it has to do with the management. I enjoy the freedom and the responsibility, I'm free to make decisions and I've been given a lot of responsibility. I appreciate the trust that's involved. I like the challenge because we're always looking for better ways to do this and solutions for the problems that come up. I especially like having an area that's mine to manage.</p><p>\"I love that I have the whole spectrum. From the time I put the seedling in the ground to the time the loggers cut it. I choose the seedlings for each stand, I determine whether the stand gets some intermediate treatment, and I'm the one who's out there helping to protect it either through fire fighting or pest management.</p><p>\"Another thing I like about my job is how we're structured. There's a lot of accountability. If I don't make sure the logger got it right then I'm going to hear it from the site prep guy. If I don't ensure that the site prep is right, I am going to hear it from the planting contractor. I'm in charge of the whole rotation. Also, I oversee planning of road work in preparation for new timber sales so just about anything that happens, it's my responsibility\u2026and I like that.\"</p><p>Terri adds: \"I'll tell you a secret, the Florida Resource Unit is the best. We have a great time together, we really do!\"</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Rayonier on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Rayonier<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rayonier\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rayonier</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: Rayonier</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/742708/Women-in-Forestry-Spotlight-on-Terri-Hall-Florida-USA\">https://www.accesswire.com/742708/Women-in-Forestry-Spotlight-on-Terri-Hall-Florida-USA</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-112681162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67R4-SXB1-F11P-X32T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 ACCESS Newswire Inc.

That's because winds have pushed the wildfire smoke from Quebec and northeastern Ontario to southern Ontario and the GTA. <br/><br/> Earlier in the week, Toronto saw northwesterly winds, bringing in smoke from fires burning in northern Ontario, explained Phillips. <br/><br/> But later in the week, \"we're going to see the winds shift more to the east and that's a concern because it's going to take the smoke from the Quebec fires, which are much more prevalent right now, and move it through Eastern Ontario, and down through the GTA,\" he continued.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toronto events cancelled over wildfire smoke</emphasis><br/><br/> The Toronto Zoo is reducing its hours on Thursday, operating from 9:30 am to 3 pm.

battling nearly 270 wildfires, along with high heat and strong winds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Quebec's forest fire protection agency says a contingent of firefighters will arrive in Abbotsford, B.C., on Sunday for a 14-day deployment.</p><p>The agency says the 153-person team includes 140 firefighters and is the largest-ever deployment of Quebec's resources outside that province.</p><p>About 400 firefighters have been dispatched by the Quebec agency to help fight blazes in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario since the start of the fire season, while B.C. has also welcomed crews from Yukon, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and as far away as Mexico.</p><p>The help comes as municipal fire crews from across B.C. reach Logan Lake, southwest of Kamloops, to assist with fire protection.</p><p>The community of about 2,000 was evacuated Thursday as flames from the 380-square-kilometre Tremont Creek wildfire flared up, also prompting evacuation alerts for properties east of Logan Lake, including the community of Cherry Creek.</p><p>Residents of some communities have been critical of the actions or inactions of the service after homes and businesses were lost last week as the White Rock Creek wildfire was fanned by high winds.</p><p>Fire officials at a briefing on Thursday admitted the criticism has been difficult to hear for crews who are on the front lines.</p><p>Environment Canada said a heat wave gripping much of southern and coastal B.C. should ease by Sunday and could be replaced by showers in some areas.</p><p>But there's concern the shift could also bring lightning, creating the potential for more wildfires.</p><p>Public health officials in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health authorities said they are concerned about the rise in temperatures expected over the coming days.</p><p>\"This is considered an emergency situation,\" said Dr. Michael Schwandt, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health. \"It can be a life-or-death situation for many people.\"</p><p>He added that his health authority has received feedback from the public on how it managed the \"heat dome\" event in late June that contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people.</p><p>The number of cooling centres has been increased, as has the work being done on outreach.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

(AP) \u2014 Thousands of firefighters continued to slow the advance of destructive wildfires in the Southwestern U.S., but officials warned they were bracing for the return Friday of the same dangerous conditions that quickly spread the wind-fueled blazes a week ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least 166 homes have been destroyed in one rural county in northeast New Mexico since the biggest fire currently burning in the U.S. started racing through small towns east and northeast of Santa Fe on April 22, the local sheriff said.</p><p>Winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph) were forecast Friday in the drought-stricken region. One expert said it's a recipe for disaster on the wildlands where some timber has a fuel moisture drier than kiln-dried wood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous fire day tomorrow,\u201d fire behavior specialist Stewart Turner said at a briefing Thursday night on the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest in Las Vegas, New Mexico.</p><p>\u201cLike we saw last Friday, epic fire behavior,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt's a day that as a firefighter, we'll write about, we'll read studies about. It's going to be a big fire day.\u201d </p><p>A swath of the country stretching from Arizona to the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.</p><p>Red flag warnings for extreme fire danger were in place Thursday for all of New Mexico and parts of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.</p><p>More than 3,000 firefighters were battling fires in Arizona and New Mexico on Thursday \u2014 about half of those in northeast New Mexico, where more than 187 square miles (484 square kilometers) of mostly timber and brush has been charred.</p><p>They focused Thursday on preventing it from moving into the rural New Mexico community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures.</p><p>\u201cGreat progress again today,\u201d incident commander Carl Schwope said Thursday night. But \u201ctomorrow has the potential to be a very destructive day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be chaotic if anything close to what happened (last) Friday occurs,\u201d added operations chief Jayson Coil.</p><p>Sheriff Chris Lopez, of New Mexico's Miguel County, confirmed for the first time Thursday night the fire there has destroyed at least 166 homes, 108 outbuildings and three commercial buildings. He joined authorities in neighboring Mora County in pleading with residents to pay close attention Friday to sudden changes in closures and evacuation orders.</p><p>\u201cFalling trees, possibly falling power lines, that\u2019s the kind of winds we're looking at,\u201d Lopez said.</p><p>Turner, the fire behavior specialist, said the gusty winds are only part of the problem. He said moisture levels in downed logs and woody debris are \u201cextremely dry\u201d \u2014 just 2% in small twigs, pine needles and grasses that \u201cactually carry a forest fire across the landscape.\"</p><p>Moisture in a small log \u201cthe size of a 4-by-4 post you buy at the lumber store ... are coming down to 8%,\u201d he said. \u201cKiln-dry is 12%. So out there, that\u2019s drying to what a kiln would do.\u201d</p><p>In northern Arizona, authorities downgraded some some evacuation orders at a fire that has destroyed at least 20 homes near Flagstaff. It's now estimated to be 43% contained. Another fire 10 miles (16 km) south of the community of Prescott was 23% contained, but officials at both blazes warned of worsening conditions expected Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere, one national wildfire managment incident team continued to oversee a large prairie fire in Nebraska, where more than 200 firefighters were battling a blaze that has been burning since last week. </p><p>About 68 square miles (176 square kilometers) of mostly grasses and farmland have been blackened near Nebraska's state line with Kansas. Several homes were destroyed and at least one person was killed. That fire was 88% contained Thursday.</p><p>___</p><p>Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada. Associated Press writer Margery A.

It's going to be a big fire day.\u201d </p><p>A swath of the country stretching from Arizona to the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.</p><p>Red flag warnings were in place Thursday for all of New Mexico and parts of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.</p><p>More than 3,000 firefighters were battling fires in Arizona and New Mexico on Thursday \u2014 about half of those in northeast New Mexico, where more than 187 square miles (484 square kilometers) of mostly timber and brush has been charred.</p><p>They focused Thursday on preventing it from moving into the rural New Mexico community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures.</p><p>\u201cGreat progress again today,\u201d incident commander Carl Schwope said Thursday night. But \u201ctomorrow has the potential to be a very destructive day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be chaotic if anything close to what happened (last) Friday occurs,\u201d added operations chief Jayson Coil.</p><p>Sheriff Chris Lopez, of New Mexico's Miguel County, confirmed for the first time Thursday night the fire there has destroyed at least 166 residences, 108 outbuildings and three commercial buildings. He joined authorities in neighboring Mora County in pleading with residents to pay close attention Friday to sudden changes in closures and evacuation orders.</p><p>\u201cFalling trees, possibly falling power lines, that\u2019s the kind of winds we're looking at,\u201d Lopez said.</p><p>Turner, the fire behavior specialist, said the gusty winds are only part of the problem. He said moisture levels in downed logs and woody debris are \u201cextremely dry\u201d\u2014 just 2% in small twigs, pine needles and grasses that \u201cactually carry a forest fire across the landscape.\"</p><p>Moisture in a small log \u201cthe size of a 4-by-4 post you buy at the lumber store ... are coming down to 8%,\u201d he said. \u201cKiln-dry is 12%. So out there, that\u2019s drying to what a kiln would do.\u201d</p><p>In northern Arizona, authorities downgraded some some evacuation orders at a fire that has destroyed at least 20 homes near Flagstaff. It's now estimated to be 43% contained. Another fire 10 miles (16 km) south of Prescott was 23% contained, but officials at both blazes warned of worsening conditions expected Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere, one national incident team continued to oversee a large prairie fire in Nebraska, where more than 200 firefighters were battling a blaze that has been burning since last week. </p><p>About 68 square miles (176 square kilometers) of mostly grasses and farmland have been blackened near Nebraska's state line with Kansas, several homes were destroyed and at least one person was killed. That fire was 88% contained Thursday.</p><p>___</p><p>Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada. Margery A.

The alert was issued July 5.</p><p>Another evacuation alert was issued on July 3 by the Yukon Emergency Measures Organization for Stewart Crossing and surrounding areas.</p><p>The alert includes a five-kilometre radius around Stewart Crossing, 12 kilometres southeast to Ethel Lake Road and east to include residences around Ethel Lake.</p><p>Both alerts could be escalated to an evacuation order if the fire directly threatens residents and visitors.</p><p>People living and visiting in the affected areas must be ready to leave within two hours of being notified.</p><p>Local residents and visitors are being asked to avoid visiting properties in the affected area and to proactively relocate before the fire becomes a direct problem.</p><p>A wildfire over the weekend has also prompted an emergency evacuation ordered July 2 for the Ethel Lake campground and surrounding area.

With minimal elevation change and a mixture of paved, hard-pack dirt and gravel surface, the trail is a good fit for people of all ages. It is very stroller-friendly, and can be completed in around two hours.</p><p>Parking is available at several points around the lakes, but the recommended start point for the loop trail is the parking lot at the south end of the lakes, near Beaver Beach and the Nature Centre. From there, the trail features a mix of dense forest and more open areas with plenty of places to stop and enjoy the view over the lakes. The trail also passes through several beaches and a fishing dock.</p><p>TOD INLET TRAIL 2/10 DIFFICULTY 60 Minutes (Optional return section 4/10 difficulty) Located in Gowlland Tod Provincial Park, Tod Inlet offers a short but very scenic hike surrounded by lush and varied vegetation and some local history. Scattered throughout the just under three-kilometre trail are the ruins of what was once the Vancouver Portland Cement Company.</p><p>Starting from a trailhead and informal parking area off of Wallace Drive in the north end of the park, the trail is mostly smooth hard pack with the odd gravel and paved sections, making it very family-friendly. After passing through forests, which could easily be mistaken for a jungle, hikers emerge on the inlet itself and are treated to a secluded beach overlooking the small boats often moored in the inlet.</p><p>On the return journey, hikers have a choice of simply retracing their steps, or taking a smaller and more challenging trail back to the parking area which more closely follows the creek and features some steep climbs, with more rocks and roots on the path. The hike can be completed in around an hour, including the return journey back to the parking area.</p><p>MOUNT DOUGLAS IRVINE TRAIL 6/10 DIFFICULTY 90 Minutes Saanich\u2019s Mount Douglas offers stunning views over the entire Greater Victoria region at its summit, which can be accessed by road or by multiple hiking trails. For those looking for the best experience which will challenge both the intermediate and the expert alike, look no further than Irvine Trail.</p><p>Starting at the beach parking lot, the four-kilometre trail features steep, rocky and narrow climbs, which include some scrambling. Lower sections of the trail run through a very dense jungle-like forest, giving way to more open and rocky areas as the elevation climbs.</p><p>About halfway into the ascent, several rocky clearings offer beautiful views toward the Gulf Islands and, on a clear day, Mount Baker in Washington state. Continuing on to the summit, the views become panoramic and uninterrupted. Depending on pace and how often you stop to enjoy the excellent views, the round trip can be completed in around 90 minutes.</p><p>FRANCIS KING REGIONAL PARK (ELSIE KING TRAIL) 1/10 DIFFICULTY 15 minutes Francis King Regional Park is 107 acres and there is a lot to see. The area is chock full of trails, with Francis King right next to Thetis Lake. One of the shortest but most interesting trails is Elsie King, which starts at the Nature House and has information signs dotted along the boardwalk to highlight some of the interesting features of this forested area. Rarely can you say you learned a lot on a hike, but on Elsie King you can, with its tree\u2019s knees, forest-fire scarring and the mysterious doorway all being highlights of this trail. The CRD describes the trail as \u201cuniversally accessible\u201d and the boardwalk is smooth throughout, making it a trail for all.</p><p>THETIS LAKE (LOWER LAKE LOOP TRAIL) 3/10 DIFFICULTY 45 minutes Thetis Lake is a hot spot, especially on hot days. But once you trek past the beaches there\u2019s some lovely nature to take in. The park has over 40 kilometers of recreational trails to explore and lots of nature to take in (the park was established as Canada\u2019s first nature sanctuary in 1958).</p><p>The lower loop trail is a nice mixture of some short steep hills and flat sections that take you all around the lower portion of the lake (the Upper Lake trail continues on from the Lower Lake trail and doubles the journey time). The trails are definitely quieter the farther away from the beach you get, although there are the occasional paddle boarders or kayakers who cruise by. But as you continue on your walk, you leave the beach behind and become surrounded by trees and nature.</p><p>MILL HILL (SUMMIT TRAIL) 5/10 DIFFICULTY 25 minutes there, 15 minutes back The Mill Hill summit trail may make you lose your breath but you\u2019ll gain a greater appreciation for the island on the way up. The summit is 203 metres up, according to the CRD, and the climb is reasonably steep but thankfully short.</p><p>At the top of this hill, you get views of the West Shore, Esquimalt, the Olympic Mountains and on a clear day, Mount Baker looming over everything. Glorious. Careful on your way down, the trail is rocky gravel and can be slippery, but a worthwhile jaunt nevertheless.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MNDYMG-news20220901PQXA0002949427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MNDYMG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6692-K6D1-F0HF-8353-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438309</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Forest wildfires, lightning strikes, hot-zone skydiving and water hazards make this movie a cinematic array of potentially fatal outdoor activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Watching it is like entering the world's most deadly amusement park, especially when a gigantic forest fire rages across the screen, set to Brian Tyler's pulsing score.</p><p>There's also that most American of threats, bad men with guns, the biggest danger of all.</p><p>The latter archetypes are chillingly represented by Aidan Gillen (\"Game of Thrones\") and Nicholas Hoult (\"Mad Max: Fury Road\"), as ruthless hit men Jack and Patrick. They're out to silence 12-year-old Connor (Finn Little, an engaging Aussie import), a kid who knows too much about a cabal of corrupt public figures.</p><p>(In a cameo role, Tyler Perry plays the boss of the bad guys, who approaches poetry with his menacing brevity: \"Assume catastrophe and act accordingly,\" he instructs.)</p><p>The action kicks off in Florida. A crusading district attorney gets a violent message from the corrupt cabal, delivered by Jack and Patrick, who are as cold-blooded as characters from a Michael Haneke movie.</p><p>Connor and his dad, Owen (Jake Weber), a forensic accountant who had been assisting the DA, take to the highway to try to escape the pursuing assassins, all of them heading in the Hitchcockian direction of north by northwest.</p><p>You may well be wondering how Angelina Jolie fits into this.</p><p>Rather abruptly, as it turns out, but fittingly, given that her character Hannah is a woodlands smoke jumper, a Montana Forest Service firefighter who skydives into infernos to put out blazes.</p><p>Ignore her Hollywood-perfect makeup, which somehow remains intact for most of the movie. She cusses, carouses and drinks like her male colleagues and leaps into flames alongside them.</p><p>Hannah has been marking time high above a remote forest in a fire watchtower. She's atoning for her personal hell, seen in flashback, of three youths who perished in a blaze she failed to properly assess.</p><p>It wasn't really her fault - fires are by nature unpredictable - but guilt doesn't require truth to inflame the conscience.</p><p>Something like a chance at redemption comes into view in Hannah's binoculars when she spots Connor, bloodied, frantic and in need of someone to trust, tramping through the forest below her watchtower.</p><p>The link between events in Florida and Montana has now been established. It will also draw in the local sheriff, Ethan (a sturdy Jon Bernthal), and his six-months-pregnant wife Allison (Medina Senghore, a revelation), who runs a wilderness survival camp.</p><p>This is a lot of people to pull together, but writer/director Sheridan is a past master of ensemble adventures in rough terrain, as seen in such earlier work as \"Wind River\" and TV's \"Yellowstone.\" He was also the writer of the border-crossing drug-war thriller \"Sicario\" and its sequel.</p><p>Sheridan co-wrote \"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" with Michael Koryta, author of the source novel, and Charles Leavitt (\"Blood Diamond\"), but there's no sense they butted heads in the brisk flow of the narrative.</p><p>The film zips along so nicely, in fact, that at times it almost seems to forget that Jolie is the lead name on the marquee and that she came out of semi-retirement as an action star - \"Salt\" happened in 2010 and her two \"Tomb Raider\" films were years before that - to once again storm across the screen.</p><p>This she surely does, proving her prowess with a firefighter's axe, although no one can upstage the fury of Mother Nature. A forest fire set by Jack and Patrick (these guys truly are evil) rips through much of the movie, demanding attention from the humans who have been busily running, chasing and shooting. Cinematographer Ben Richardson, who previously worked with Sheridan on \"Wind River\" and \"Yellowstone,\" provides breathtaking overhead and up-close visuals of the blaze.</p><p>\"Those Who Wish Me Dead,\" made for the biggest possible screens, really makes me wish movie theatres were back in operation. This won't happen for a while yet, in Ontario at least, while we deal with our raging real-life pandemic inferno.</p><p>Those Who Wish Me Dead</p><p>Three stars (out of 4)</p><p>Starring Angelina Jolie, Finn Little, Nicholas Hoult, Aidan Gillen, Jake Weber, Medina Senghore, Jon Bernthal and Tyler Perry. Directed and co-written by Taylor Sheridan. Streaming Friday. 100 min.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-news20210514TTA2021051460956732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62NP-2VB1-JDV5-F0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.
