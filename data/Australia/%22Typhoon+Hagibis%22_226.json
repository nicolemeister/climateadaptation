continues to batter large areas of Japan's main island, swelling rivers, triggering landslides and leaving at least 58 people dead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parts of Nagano and Gifu, including areas known for scenic mountain trails and hot springs, were flooded by massive downpours on Wednesday.</p><p>Public broadcaster NHK showed a swollen river gouging into its embankment and destroying a highway.</p><p>In the city of Gero, the rising river was flowing just below a bridge.</p><p>Flooding and mudslides blocked parts of a main road connecting major tourist destinations in Nagano, stranding hundreds of residents and visitors, though they were believed to have been safely evacuated.</p><p>In neighbouring Gifu, hundreds were isolated in the hot spring towns of Gero and Ontake.</p><p>In the scenic mountainous town of Takayama, several houses were hit by a mudslide, but their residents were safely rescued.</p><p>As of Wednesday morning, the death toll from the heavy rains which started over the weekend had risen to 58.</p><p>At the peak, as many as 3.6 million people were advised to evacuate, although it was not mandatory and the number who sought shelter was not known.</p><p>About half of the advisories had been lifted by Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>In places where rain has subsided, residents have been busy cleaning up their homes and workplaces.</p><p>In Gero, a man washed off mud at the entrance of his riverside house despite the evacuation advisory.</p><p>\"I was told to run away and my neighbours all went, but I stayed,\" he said.</p><p>\"I didn't want my house to be washed away in my absence.\"</p><p>In Oita, teachers at a nursery school were wiping the floor and drying wet furniture.</p><p>\"I hope we can return to normal life as soon as possible,\" Principal Yuko Kitaguchi told NHK.</p><p>As the rains pounded central Japan, flooding continued to affect the southern region.</p><p>Search and rescue operations continued in Kumamoto, where 14 people remained missing.</p><p>Tens of thousands of troops, police and other rescue workers have been mobilised from around the country to assist.</p><p>Rescue operations have been hampered by the rains, flooding, mudslides and disrupted communications.</p><p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has urged residents to be cautious.</p><p>\"Disasters may happen even with little rain where ground has loosened from previous rainfall,\" he said.</p><p>Japan is at high risk of heavy rain in early summer when wet and warm air from the East China Sea flows into a seasonal rain front above the country.</p><p>Extreme weather disasters have become increasingly common in Japan recently.</p><p>Last year, Typhoon Hagibis killed nearly 100 people, a year after more than 200 died in western Japan in the worst flooding in decades.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABC/Wires</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

This is part of their society. They are loyal, honest people, determined to achieve set tasks. As bad as the coronavirus is, they are determined to hold the Tokyo Olympics.\"</p><p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and JOC are under immense public pressure to cancel or delay this year's summer Games, which are scheduled to start on July 24. But until Thursday, when retired judo athlete and JOC executive board member Kaori Yamaguchi said she also favoured delaying the event, the Japanese government and Olympics organisers were resolute that they would go ahead.</p><p>Yamaguchi told Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asian Review she believed the IOC was \"putting athletes at risk\" by asking them to continue to train as normal. IOC president Thomas Bach refused to change his stance last week, while Australian Olympic Committee boss Matt Carroll said the feedback he was getting was that athletes wanted to train, prepare and compete.</p><p>Yamaguchi said she would argue the case to the rest of the JOC at a meeting on March 27.</p><p>\"Unlike other sporting events, the Olympics symbolise the ideal that sports bring about world peace,\" she said. \"We should not hold [the Games] if people across the world can't enjoy themselves.\"</p><p>Jones made no comment on whether or not the Games should proceed, but said the Japanese, having made the commitment to host the global event, would not change their minds easily.</p><p>\"Typhoon Hagibis provides another example of Japanese being committed to honour the world of rugby,\" he said, referring to the super storm that prompted mass evacuations, led to Rugby World Cup matches being cancelled in Japan last year and almost derailed the knockout stage of the tournament.</p><p>\"At least 85 staff slept in the stadium ... spent every living minute to get the stadium ready. Japan did not start the quarter-final [against South Africa] through fortune, but worked to earn it.</p><p>The son of a Japanese interpreter and an Australian soldier, Jones has maintained a lifelong connection with the country of his mother's birth. He married a Japanese teacher, Hiroko, with whom he raised their daughter, Chelsea. He was a hooker for legendary Sydney rugby nursery Randwick.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc79spl180ej7189fgqdy8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YGB-Y9R1-F0J6-J3S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Borrowing from rugby league, the former RA director of rugby pitched the innovations to World Rugby and they were first trialled in the NRC in 2019, and then Super Rugby AU from 2020.</p><p>The 50:22 has helped ease the claustrophobia in rugby's defences and is being used by smart kickers in Europe to manipulate defences, even from set-pieces.</p><p>\"Those two will be up for full adoption. I think they've been really well-received,\" Gilpin told the Cauliflower.</p><p>\"It is really interesting when you see the analysis, and this was the intention, with the 50;/22, defences are being forced to put players in the backfield and that not only creates the space but also reduces the number of collisions in the defensive line, which is making the game safer.</p><p>\"And [the goal-line drop-out], it is just getting away from that constant pick and drive.

But they got enough of a workout hauling all their sponsors' loot home.</p><p>There was the usual new footy boots and headgear but Cadbury was a very popular stall.

Borrowing from rugby league, the former RA director of rugby pitched the innovations to World Rugby and they were first trialled in the NRC in 2019, and then Super Rugby AU from 2020.</p><p>The 50:22 has helped ease the claustrophobia in rugby's defences and is being used by smart kickers in Europe to manipulate defences, even from set-pieces.</p><p>\"Those two will be up for full adoption. I think they've been really well-received,\" Gilpin told the Cauliflower.</p><p>\"It is really interesting when you see the analysis, and this was the intention, with the 50;/22, defences are being forced to put players in the backfield and that not only creates the space but also reduces the number of collisions in the defensive line, which is making the game safer.</p><p>\"And [the goal-line drop-out], it is just getting away from that constant pick and drive.

The Rebels are most in need of experienced midfielders and one of their most senior players is contemplating an overseas move.</p><p>The Brumbies are also looking for a no.12, however, with Irae Simone moving to France next year.</p><p>Kerevi would be looking a massive haircut to return home. But local sources say Suntory are looking to spend big money on a fly-half, as opposed to an outside centre.</p><p>Elsewhere, rising Brumbies lock Nick Frost is looking at the possibility of getting out of contract with the Robbie Deans-coached Panasonic Wild Knights, after being named in the Wallabies squad recently.</p><p>Whether he can wriggle out remains to be seen and RA will be very careful to keep their distance, given they're also talking with Panasonic about Marika Koroibete's return this winter as a Giteau Law player.</p><p>And Queensland will farewell stalwart forward Angus Scott-Young at the end of the year, after he signed a two-year deal with Northhampton.

The two sides have only met once before and Wales ran out 54-9 winners that day at the 2015 World Cup.</p><p>The magnitude of the storm has grabbed everyone's attention in Japan, yet the Wallabies said their preparation for a final pool match would not be compromised.</p><p>\"We've been really concentrating on what is happening tomorrow night,\" said Wallabies assistant coach Simon Raiwalui. \"We've got a huge game against a Georgian team so we've just been preparing [for] that and whatever happens after that we will deal with that.\"</p><p>The game cancellations means England now have more time to prepare and study their opponents before a quarter-final.</p><p>\"We have a fairly exceptional record in two-week preparations,\" said England coach Eddie Jones. \"We are batting at around 95 per cent and so we have to find five per cent from somewhere.\"</p><p>Stand-in Wallabies captain David Pocock said: \"I haven't really seen any of the stuff around the typhoon or thought that far ahead.

We are among the many authors who contributed.</p><p>It's an important record of the magnitude and speed of changes to global climate, drawing on the latest data from across the fields of climate science. </p><h>A record year</h><p>Global average temperatures in 2019 were 1.1? above pre-industrial levels. Only 2016 was hotter, but that year came at the end of an extreme El Ni\u00f1o, which typically has a warming influence on global temperatures.</p><p>The last five years were the world's five warmest on record. Areas which were especially warm, with temperatures in 2019 more than 2? above average, included parts of Australia, Alaska and northern Russia, eastern Europe and southern Africa. Central North America was the only significant land area with below-average temperatures. </p><p>Human-driven climate change is predominantly caused by increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, the three most potent greenhouse gases, have continued to grow and are now, respectively, 147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial levels, measured in the year 1750.</p><p>Global emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels reached a record high of 36.6 billion tonnes, of which about half is absorbed by vegetation and oceans. </p><p>The Antarctic ozone hole was its smallest since 2002, after an unusually early spring breakdown of the Antarctic polar vortex following a <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-air-above-antarctica-is-suddenly-getting-warmer-heres-what-it-means-for-australia-123080\">sudden warming</url> in the polar stratosphere. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The air above Antarctica is suddenly getting warmer - here's what it means for Australia</emphasis></p><p>Many other indicators of large-scale climate change continued their long-term trends in 2019. These include the heat content of the global ocean - an important indicator because around 90% of warming generated by greenhouse gases from human activities is taken by the oceans. </p><p>In 2019, ocean heat content reached the highest levels since instrumental records began. Global mean sea level also reached new highs in 2019, while Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent was well below average.</p><p>Glacial mass declined for the 32nd consecutive year. In Switzerland, for example, glacier loss over the past five years has exceeded 10%, the highest rate of decline in more than a century. </p><h>Australia's fire and drought</h><p>The report confirms the ongoing drought in Australia and exceptional fire weather conditions late in the year were among the most significant global climate events last year.</p><p>2019 was Australia's warmest and driest year since national records began - the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/weather-bureau-says-hottest-driest-year-on-record-led-to-extreme-bushfire-season-129447\">first time</url> both records have been broken in the same year.</p><p>In December, the monthly accumulated Forest Fire Danger Index - an indicator of severe fire weather - was the highest on record for any month in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the ACT. Some fires burned for longer than two months. </p><p>In January and February 2019, a dry summer in Tasmania contributed to fires in the normally moist western and central parts of the island - the second time in four years that fires burnt regions where historically such events were extremely rare.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The world may lose half its sandy beaches by 2100. It's not too late to save most of them</emphasis></p><p>The drought was strongly influenced by a very strong positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole - an oscillation of sea surface temperatures which affects the climate in Australia. A strong negative Southern Annular Mode - a climate driver which originates in Antarctica - brought westerly winds and dry conditions to the eastern states from September.</p><p>Australia was not the only nation affected by drought in 2019 - southern Africa, southeast Asia and central Chile were also significantly affected. In the Chilean capital Santiago, rainfall was more than 70% below average.</p><h>Heatwaves and cyclones</h><p>Two exceptional heatwaves affected Europe in the summer. France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom all had their highest recorded temperatures. Belgium and the Netherlands both reached 40? for the first time, and Paris reached a high of 42.6?.</p><p>Australia had extreme heatwaves both early and late in the year, and in South America, temperatures exceeded 30? as far south as Tierra del Fuego. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Rain has eased the dry, but more is needed to break the drought</emphasis></p><p>Tropical cyclones are amongst the most destructive weather phenomena in most years, and 2019 was no exception. The most severe cyclone impact was in  Mozambique and Zimbabwe, when Cyclone Idai hit in mid-March, killing more than 900 people.</p><p>Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest ever to affect land in the North Atlantic, caused massive destruction in the Bahamas, whilst Typhoon Hagibis led to exceptional flooding in Japan, and daily rainfall of more than 900 millimetres. The North Indian Ocean also had its most active cyclone season on record.</p><h>Looking to the future</h><p>Global climate projections show that under all scenarios, temperatures will continue to warm - and years such as 2019 will become the norm this decade. </p><p>The report is intended to inform decisions around the world on adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blair Trewin receives funding from the Bureau of Meteorology and the World Meteorological Organization.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pep Canadell receives funding from the National Environmental Science Program and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-133056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-JRB1-DXP7-12HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><timeReceived>7:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

This is part of their society. They are loyal, honest people, determined to achieve set tasks.</p><p>\"As bad as the coronavirus is, they are determined to hold the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\"</p><p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and (JOC) are under immense public pressure to cancel or delay this year's summer Games, which are scheduled to start on July 24. But until Thursday, when retired Judo athlete and JOC executive board member Kaori Yamaguchi said she also favoured delaying the event, the Japanese government and Olympics organisers were resolute that they would go ahead.</p><p>Yamaguchi told Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asian Review that she believed the IOC was \"putting athletes at risk\" by asking them to continue to train, as normal, in the wake of the pandemic. IOC president Thomas Bach refused to change his stance this week, while Australian Olympic Committee boss Matt Carroll said the consistent feedback he was getting was that athletes wanted to train, prepare and compete.</p><p>Yamaguchi, who is one of the committee's 23 executive board members, said she would argue the case to the rest of the Japanese Olympic Committee at a meeting on March 27.</p><p>\"Unlike other sporting events, the Olympics symbolise the ideal that sports bring about world peace,\" she said. \"We should not hold [the Olympics] if people across the world can't enjoy themselves.\"</p><p>Jones made no comment on whether or not the Games should proceed, but said the Japanese people, having made the commitment to host the global event, would not change their minds easily.</p><p>\"Typhoon Hagibis provides another example of Japanese being committed to honour the world of rugby,\" he said, referring to the super storm that prompted mass evacuations, saw Rugby World Cup matches cancelled in Japan last year and almost derailed the knockout stage of the tournament.</p><p>\"At least 85 staff slept in the stadium ... spent every living minute to get the stadium ready. Japan did not start the quarter-final [against South Africa] through fortune, but worked to earn it.</p><p>\"So the Japanese will fight to the end to pull off the Olympics. As the South Africa [2015] and Scotland [2019] wins will testify, a people can do amazing things when honour is part of the fabric of society.\"</p><p>Jones took Australia (2003) and England (2019) to Rugby World Cup finals, but is most famous for coaching the Japanese Test team to a history-making 34-32 win over South Africa in the pool stages of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. It was the first time Japan had beat a tier-one nation at a World Cup, only their second victory in the 24-year history of the tournament and, until the 2019 World Cup, the nation's finest hour on a rugby pitch.</p><p>The son of a Japanese interpreter and an Australian soldier, Jones has maintained a lifelong connection with the country of his mother's birth. He married a Japanese teacher, Hiroko, with whom he raised their daughter, Chelsea, bilingual. A teacher by trade and hooker for legendary Sydney rugby nursery Randwick, he cut his coaching teeth in the Japanese university system in the 1990s, going on to serve as an assistant coach for the national side and head coach of Top League side Suntory Sungoliath.</p><p>After a title-winning stint back in Australia with the Brumbies and five years coaching the Wallabies, Jones went to Europe, South Africa and eventually back to Japan, spending the next four seasons coaching Suntory before taking over from John Kirwan as the Brave Blossoms head coach.</p><p>Confronted with an under-performing team, it was then that he did his first deep dive into Japanese culture.</p><p>\"They had not won a Rugby World Cup game for 24 years and their average score versus tier-one countries at [World Cups] was an 85-0 defeat,\" Jones said.</p><p>\"In the first two months, the Japan under-20s played Wales under-20s and were beaten by 150 points! I got all the high-development coaches in the same room and asked them the problems with Japanese rugby. The excuses were simple: 'don't train hard enough, aren't big enough, cannot make decisions'.</p><p>\"But my view of Japanese were different. My mother is a hard-working, no-excuses lady, full of determination and vigour, and so I decided to delve into the Samurai culture. I commissioned a research project: 'Discovering the roots of Samurai culture'. Loyalty, respect and honour came through strongly.\"</p><p>He put the concept of honour at the centre of the Brave Blossoms operating mantra. While his ferocious work ethic was not always remembered fondly by players in that side, Jones turned them into a team capable of beating the Springboks. That match recently formed the basis of a film, The Brighton Miracle.</p><p>\"Honour was important for my Japanese team; show the rest of the world, even if we are small we can fight with honour,\" he said, adding: \"Japanese want to honour their Olympic commitment.\"</p><p>Last year, despite the widespread typhoon devastation, workers and tournament organisers cleaned up Yokohama's International Stadium in time for Japan to play Scotland in the final pool A match to decide which nation advanced to the quarter-finals.</p><p>The Brave Blossoms, coached by Jamie Joseph, beat Scotland 28-21. It was another major watershed moment for sport in the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520254870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YG9-MM91-JBJ7-N02W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><timeReceived>02:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As the South Africa [2015] and Scotland [2019] wins will testify, a people can do amazing things when honour is part of the fabric of society.\"</p><p>Jones took Australia (2003) and England (2019) to Rugby World Cup finals, but is most famous for coaching the Japanese Test team to a history-making 34-32 win over South Africa in the pool stages of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. It was the first time Japan had beat a tier-one nation at a World Cup, only their second victory in the 24-year history of the tournament and, until the 2019 World Cup, the nation's finest hour on a rugby pitch.</p><p>The son of a Japanese interpreter and an Australian soldier, Jones has maintained a lifelong connection with the country of his mother's birth. He married a Japanese teacher, Hiroko, with whom he raised their daughter, Chelsea, bilingual. A teacher by trade and hooker for legendary Sydney rugby nursery Randwick, he cut his coaching teeth in the Japanese university system in the 1990s, going on to serve as an assistant coach for the national side and head coach of Top League side Suntory Sungoliath.</p><p>After a title-winning stint back in Australia with the Brumbies and five years coaching the Wallabies, Jones went to Europe, South Africa and eventually back to Japan, spending the next four seasons coaching Suntory before taking over from John Kirwan as the Brave Blossoms head coach.</p><p>Confronted with an under-performing team, it was then that he did his first deep dive into Japanese culture.</p><p>\"They had not won a Rugby World Cup game for 24 years and their average score versus tier-one countries at [World Cups] was an 85-0 defeat,\" Jones said.</p><p>\"In the first two months, the Japan under-20s played Wales under-20s and were beaten by 150 points! I got all the high-development coaches in the same room and asked them the problems with Japanese rugby. The excuses were simple: 'don't train hard enough, aren't big enough, cannot make decisions'.</p><p>\"But my view of Japanese were different. My mother is a hard-working, no-excuses lady, full of determination and vigour, and so I decided to delve into the Samurai culture. I commissioned a research project: 'Discovering the roots of Samurai culture'. Loyalty, respect and honour came through strongly.\"</p><p>He put the concept of honour at the centre of the Brave Blossoms operating mantra. While his ferocious work ethic was not always remembered fondly by players in that side, Jones turned them into a team capable of beating the Springboks. That match recently formed the basis of a film, The Brighton Miracle.</p><p>\"Honour was important for my Japanese team; show the rest of the world, even if we are small we can fight with honour,\" he said, adding: \"Japanese want to honour their Olympic commitment.\"</p><p>Last year, despite the widespread typhoon devastation, workers and tournament organisers cleaned up Yokohama's International Stadium in time for Japan to play Scotland in the final pool A match to decide which nation advanced to the quarter-finals.</p><p>The Brave Blossoms, coached by Jamie Joseph, beat Scotland 28-21. It was another major watershed moment for sport in the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520254870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YG9-4TG1-DY19-C3RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><timeReceived>01:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A little over an hour later, the levee burst, submerging his home and sweeping away everything in it. He barely escaped: Minutes before, he had driven to higher ground after being warned by volunteer firefighters to flee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The levee, in an area north-west of Tokyo, was one of at least 55 breached as Typhoon Hagibis dumped record-breaking rains on Japan last weekend, with more than 70 people dying in the storm and floodwaters hitting more than 10,000 homes.</p><p>Japan, a nation grimly accustomed to natural disasters, has invested many billions of dollars in a world-class infrastructure meant to soften nature's wrath. But with the flooding in areas across central and northern Japan in recent days, the country has been forced to examine more deeply the assumptions that underpin its flood control system.</p><p>That is raising a difficult question, for Japan and for the world: Can even the costliest systems be future-proofed in an age of storms made more powerful by climate change?</p><p>Yasuo Nihei, a professor of river engineering at the Tokyo University of Science, said that in places around Japan, \"we're observing rain of a strength that we have never experienced. When we look at the costs, I think it's clear that flood control programs need to be accelerated.\"</p><p>Even so, he said, \"realistically, there will be rains you can't defend against\".</p><p>That has not always been the view of the Japanese government. For centuries, it has seen disaster management as a problem to be solved by engineering.</p><p>After a devastating typhoon killed more than 1200 people in the late 1950s, Japan embarked on a series of public works projects aimed at taming its many rivers. Levees and dams sprang up on nearly every river, and civil engineers sheathed long stretches of riverbeds in concrete.</p><p>While the projects have saved countless lives, they are insufficient to meet the challenge of increasingly extreme weather patterns, said Shiro Maeno, a professor of hydraulic engineering at Okayama University.</p><p>\"In the current state, it wouldn't be strange for a flood to happen anytime, anywhere,\" Maeno said. \"Things we never could have considered have started happening in the last few years.\"</p><p>The heavy investment in infrastructure has not come without a cost. The spending has helped send Japan's national debt to record highs, as the country has approved many projects that turned out to be minimally effective or, at worst, damaging to the environment.</p><p>The Japanese government has also used infrastructure spending to stimulate an economy that was stagnant for decades. Critics note that some of the projects are little more than a tool for enriching construction companies, with part of the proceeds being returned to local politicians in the form of campaign donations.</p><p>Whatever the motivation for the spending, engineers are warning that as storms grow in intensity, the government faces diminishing returns as it contemplates raising levees or digging new drainage tunnels. But in the wake of the typhoon, the burning question among Japanese politicians is whether the country should be investing even more.</p><p>Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston who studies disaster management, said that huge engineering projects had often provided a false sense of security, leading people to avoid what can be a more effective response: evacuation.</p><p>\"Why would you possibly leave when you have this system set up to protect you?\" he said. \"Why go anywhere? It's a moral hazard when you believe the systems in place will protect you more than the process of fleeing, which is of course what we really want.\"</p><p>In 2017, the national government passed a revision to the country's flood and river controls laws aimed at decreasing the mounting economic damage from extreme weather and bringing the number of deaths caused by the failure to evacuate down to zero - a challenge made greater by the country's rapidly ageing population.</p><p>The changes have forced local governments to revise how they prepare for disasters. Instead of planning for 100-year storms, they are now thinking about more destructive once-in-1000-year disasters.</p><p>Last summer, Nagano city, which administers Naganuma, where Ogawa's house was inundated, redrew its flood maps. The old maps, drawn up in 2006, imagined a situation in which Naganuma could be covered with up to five metres of floodwater.</p><p>But planners now imagine a much worse scenario: 40 centimetres of rain over two days, resulting in more than a dozen levee breaches and leaving Naganuma drowning under 20 metres of water.</p><p>Even that might not be pessimistic enough. Last weekend, when Typhoon Hagibis hit Hakone, a mountain resort town south of Tokyo, 100 centimetres of rain fell in 48 hours.</p><p>In a city like Tokyo with millions of people, the planners' 1000-year projection might justify spending billions on high-tech flood prevention systems.</p><p>But in a rural area like Naganuma, the government needs to make tough choices, said Hiroki Okamoto, a local official in charge of managing the Chikuma River.</p><p>\"We have to move forward with the understanding that no matter what's installed, there will be a flood that it can't defend against,\" Okamoto said. The government needs to shift its focus to \"doing public relations work so that people will evacuate\" during floods, he said, adding, \"It's hard to get them to run.\"</p><p>That thinking goes against the mainstream, said Aldrich, the professor at Northeastern University.</p><p>\"As societies think about how to deal with global climate change, many of them are starting to switch to an engineering mindset, when they should be placing more emphasis on so-called soft measures like encouraging neighbours to help each other evacuate ahead of a disaster,\" he said.</p><p>\"A lot of societies in North America or Singapore or Japan have become fixated on the idea that we'll engineer our way out of this problem,\" he added. \"We'll build floating buildings or better sensors, which is all well and good, but what do you do if your cellphone doesn't work? Or you don't have access to electricity?\"</p><p>In Naganuma, where rescuers have so far recovered two bodies from the area near the levee breach, it was those \"soft measures\" that saved people like Ogawa and the 400 others who evacuated the area.</p><p>Mitsuyoshi Oguchi, a local handyman, said that every year the entire town - which has a long history of flooding - participated in evacuation drills. At a temple close to the river, a wooden pole more than three metres tall records the area's major floods. Near the top, the year 1742 is written in thick, black Chinese characters.</p><p>On Saturday evening, as the waters rose, city officials called residents and begged them to leave. Volunteers, including Ogawa's wife, Kyoko, went door to door, helping their elderly neighbours make the trip to an evacuation centre.</p><p>Still, few residents expected that a typhoon would break the levee in their lifetimes.</p><p>On Wednesday, construction crews raced to repair the gap in the Chikuma levee. Cranes lowered giant concrete blocks into the breach, then covered them with dirt. On the far side of the levee, where low fields run to the riverbank, hundreds of apple trees were covered to their crowns in muddy water.</p><p>Here and there, residents took the first steps toward recovery, shovelling out their homes and dragging away waterlogged furniture.</p><p>\"We're lucky,\" Ogawa's daughter Natsumi said in front of her parents' stately home, one of many houses built with money from the orchards. \"All of our furniture got washed away, so there's not much to clean up.\"</p><p>Ogawa himself was not quite so sanguine. His home and his apple business will recover, he said, but he's not sure he ever will.</p><p>\"Even if the levee is fixed, every time there's a heavy rain or a typhoon, my chest is going to tighten,\" he said. \"I want to move to a place where my family can live without worrying.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520194721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9H-F4K1-JBJ7-N1YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1377\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It has gone from a tropical storm to a category five typhoon in the space of 24 hours and according to The Weather Network website is the \"strongest storm anywhere in the world\" and could be the most destructive anywhere on earth this year.</p><p>The storm was initially set to hit southern Japan on Saturday, meaning the Wallabies' upcoming game against Georgia in Shizuoka would not be affected.

If Australia then pick up a winning bonus point over Georgia, which is highly likely, they will go three points atop Pool D (16 points to Wales on 13).</p><p>Therefore, if Wales' final fixture is washed out, the northern hemisphere side will fall a point short of the Wallabies given they will only get two points for a cancelled match.</p><p>However, if Wales won with a bonus point over Fiji, the best the Wallabies could hope for is to be tied on points with Wales if there is a typhoon but even then Warren Gatland's side go through on a countback because they defeated Australia 29-25. If Wales lost to Fiji, Australia's chances of finishing first increase significantly.</p><p>Topping the pool for Australia would likely see them avoid England in a quarter-final and come up against France instead.</p><p>However, the England and France match in Yokohama on Saturday could also be affected by the typhoon.</p><p>Because England (15 points) are ahead of France (13 points), they would finish top of Pool C if the match was cancelled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Scotland and Ireland's World Cup campaigns could be affected by the typhoons if their matches against Japan and Samoa respectively are abandoned.</p><p>If Scotland (5 points currently), can claim nine points (the equivalent of a win and a bonus point win) in their next two matches, Ireland (11 points) could be booted out of the World Cup if they split the points in their last pool match against Samoa on Saturday in Fukuoka City.</p><p>However, if Scotland do not get onto the field against Japan on Sunday, their World Cup campaign will be all but over, provided Ireland do not lose to Samoa.</p><p>Coach Gregor Townsend, who initially thought the Typhoon's name was \"Haggis\", said his side would not let it be a distraction.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520190753</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X77-7DN1-DY19-C1DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><timeReceived>08:54 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Our final game was set for Friday, October 11 in Shizuoka, about an hour south of Tokyo - right in the path of Typhoon Hagibis which was expected to make landfall the following day.</p><p>We'd heard the reports that a typhoon was coming, and in the days leading up to it we were frequently checking the updates as we feared we wouldn't be able to get to Tokyo to make our flight home on Sunday.</p><p>When we arrived in Shizuoka on Thursday, we booked seats on an early shinkansen (bullet train) to Tokyo, thinking if we left by 8am, we'd be in Tokyo before the worst of the typhoon and, hopefully, before the trains were suspended.</p><p>The following day, game day, we went straight to the train station to check that the trains were still running, only to see a big sign - all trains were suspended for Saturday.</p><p>We spent the next few hours wandering the streets of Shizuoka trying to decide what to do.</p><p>Our flight home from Tokyo was scheduled for 5pm Sunday. We basically had two options - catch the earliest train we could on Sunday, if the trains were back up and running by then, straight to the airport, or skip the Wallabies game that night and head to Tokyo while we still could.</p><p>In the end we thought, \"bugger it\", and decided to go to the game and risk the trains on Sunday, hoping we'd be able to leave by 1pm at the latest.</p><p>If we missed our flight, well, that's what travel insurance was for, right?</p><p>That decision turned out to be the best one. Not only did the Wallabies win against Georgia, putting them through to the finals, but our flight would later be cancelled anyway.</p><p>The rain had begun as we made our way to the stadium that night and we thanked our lucky stars for the $20 ponchos we bought at Disneyland Tokyo a few weeks beforehand. They certainly came in handy as the rain bucketed down during the kilometre-long walk from the station to the stadium. It was the heaviest rain we'd seen in a long time.</p><p>At the end of the night, before heading back to our hotel, we decided to go to the nearest 7-eleven and stock up on some essentials - pringles, kit-kats, water and beer - to get us through the following day.</p><p>We were advised to stay indoors on Saturday, and ensure we had enough food and water and that our phones were charged.</p><p>The next morning we woke to news that a man had already been killed as a result of the typhoon, when the car he was driving flipped over in the wind. Thousands of residents in the Shizuoka prefecture, the prefecture we were in, had also been evacuated.</p><p>We were, however, safe where we were staying in Shizuoka city. The rain was still steady and we decided to brave it to see if the McDonald's a few blocks away was open, as we were craving a cheeseburger after a few too many drinks the night before.</p><p>What awaited us was a far cry from the bustling neighborhood we'd seen just the night before - the streets were all but deserted and everything was shut, including Maccas, as the rain and wind got heavier and stronger. The only place open in the vicinity was an Indian restaurant, so we ate there, filling our bellies while we could, as we feared we may not be able to venture outside come dinnertime, when the typhoon was expected to hit.</p><p>Back in the safety of our tiny hotel room, we spent the next few hours watching movies before joining a British trio for drinks in the hotel lobby. What better way to wait out a typhoon than with the nine per cent cans of vodka lemons that were readily available in convenience stores?</p><p>We enjoyed noodles in a cup for dinner that night, and when the rain ceased outside we figured we were in the eye of the storm. During the break in rain we, along with our new British friends, decided to try our luck and see if there was a bar open showing the only Rugby World Cup game not cancelled that day, between Ireland and Samoa.</p><p>After spending what seemed like forever searching for a bar that was not only open but was also showing the game, we finally found one. By the time the game was over we went outside and the rain still hadn't returned. It seemed as if the storm had passed and it wasn't as bad as predicted. We'd survived the typhoon!</p><p>The next day saw blue skies and streets once again filled with people; there were even markets on. It was hard to imagine a typhoon had just come through. However, we were lucky. We were in a higher area that luckily escaped much of the damage and devastation that Typhoon Hagibis brought.</p><p>So far the death toll is 74 people, and counting, with more than a dozen still missing.</p><p>More than 5000 people are still in evacuation centres and more than 12,000 homes remain without power or running water.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis also caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with a number of trains damaged by flooding.</p><p>Calum and I were two of those people affected by transport disruptions; the biggest impact to us was that our flight ended up being cancelled, which, in the scheme of things is pretty insignificant. In fact, that cancellation gave us an extra three days in Japan. We're finally on our way home after a holiday we'll never forget. We just hope that this time next year, wherever we may be, we are not in the path of a typhoon, hurricane or cyclone.</p><p>Sophie Harris is the Moree Champion's senior journalist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MORCHA-doc77k72yvrl7s14f2rsgyj</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MORCHA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8X-S271-F0J6-J29M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390598</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A year later - to the day - and I was in Japan when one of the biggest typhoons to hit the country was set to make landfall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My partner Calum and I had been in Japan for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.</p><p>We had managed to secure tickets to all four of Australia's pool games. Our final game was set for Friday, October 11 in Shizuoka, about an hour south of Tokyo - right in the path of Typhoon Hagibis which was expected to make landfall the following day.</p><p>We'd heard the reports that a typhoon was coming, and in the days leading up to it we were frequently checking the updates as we feared we wouldn't be able to get to Tokyo to make our flight home on Sunday.</p><p>When we arrived in Shizuoka on Thursday, we booked seats on an early shinkansen (bullet train) to Tokyo, thinking if we left by 8am, we'd be in Tokyo before the worst of the typhoon and, hopefully, before the trains were suspended.</p><p>The following day, game day, we went straight to the train station to check that the trains were still running, only to see a big sign - all trains were suspended for Saturday.</p><p>We spent the next few hours wandering the streets of Shizuoka trying to decide what to do.</p><p>Our flight home from Tokyo was scheduled for 5pm Sunday. We basically had two options - catch the earliest train we could on Sunday, if the trains were back up and running by then, straight to the airport, or skip the Wallabies game that night and head to Tokyo while we still could.</p><p>In the end we thought, \"bugger it\", and decided to go to the game and risk the trains on Sunday, hoping we'd be able to leave by 1pm at the latest.</p><p>If we missed our flight, well, that's what travel insurance was for, right?</p><p>That decision turned out to be the best one. Not only did the Wallabies win against Georgia, putting them through to the finals, but our flight would later be cancelled anyway.</p><p>The rain had begun as we made our way to the stadium that night and we thanked our lucky stars for the $20 ponchos we bought at Disneyland Tokyo a few weeks beforehand. They certainly came in handy as the rain bucketed down during the kilometre-long walk from the station to the stadium. It was the heaviest rain we'd seen in a long time.</p><p>At the end of the night, before heading back to our hotel, we decided to go to the nearest 7-eleven and stock up on some essentials - pringles, kit-kats, water and beer - to get us through the following day.</p><p>We were advised to stay indoors on Saturday, and ensure we had enough food and water and that our phones were charged.</p><p>The next morning we woke to news that a man had already been killed as a result of the typhoon, when the car he was driving flipped over in the wind. Thousands of residents in the Shizuoka prefecture, the prefecture we were in, had also been evacuated.</p><p>We were, however, safe where we were staying in Shizuoka city. The rain was still steady and we decided to brave it to see if the McDonald's a few blocks away was open, as we were craving a cheeseburger after a few too many drinks the night before.</p><p>What awaited us was a far cry from the bustling neighborhood we'd seen just the night before - the streets were all but deserted and everything was shut, including Maccas, as the rain and wind got heavier and stronger. The only place open in the vicinity was an Indian restaurant, so we ate there, filling our bellies while we could, as we feared we may not be able to venture outside come dinnertime, when the typhoon was expected to hit.</p><p>Back in the safety of our tiny hotel room, we spent the next few hours watching movies before joining a British trio for drinks in the hotel lobby. What better way to wait out a typhoon than with the nine per cent cans of vodka lemons that were readily available in convenience stores?</p><p>We enjoyed noodles in a cup for dinner that night, and when the rain ceased outside we figured we were in the eye of the storm. During the break in rain we, along with our new British friends, decided to try our luck and see if there was a bar open showing the only Rugby World Cup game not cancelled that day, between Ireland and Samoa.</p><p>After spending what seemed like forever searching for a bar that was not only open but was also showing the game, we finally found one. By the time the game was over we went outside and the rain still hadn't returned. It seemed as if the storm had passed and it wasn't as bad as predicted. We'd survived the typhoon!</p><p>The next day saw blue skies and streets once again filled with people; there were even markets on. It was hard to imagine a typhoon had just come through. However, we were lucky. We were in a higher area that escaped much of the damage and devastation that Typhoon Hagibis brought.</p><p>So far the death toll is 74 people, and counting, with more than a dozen still missing.</p><p>More than 5000 people are still in evacuation centres and more than 12,000 homes remain without power or running water.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis also caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with a number of trains damaged by flooding.</p><p>Calum and I were two of those people affected by transport disruptions; the biggest impact to us was that our flight ended up being cancelled, which, in the scheme of things is pretty insignificant. In fact, that cancellation gave us an extra three days in Japan. We're finally on our way home after a holiday we'll never forget. We just hope that this time next year, wherever we may be, we are not in the path of a typhoon, hurricane or cyclone.</p><p>Sophie Harris is senior journalist at The Inverell Times' sister paper, the Moree Champion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVRTM-doc77kp32co3z5ktpuce3m</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVRTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-TFC1-JD34-V2M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390574</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Typhoon Hagibis is expected to hit western and eastern Japan between Saturday and Sunday. The Pacific side of western and eastern Japan may see torrential rains from Friday until the typhoon passes. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of floods caused by the high waves and tides. Typhoons have hit the race at Suzuka Circuit - about 375km west of Tokyo - in the past, forcing qualifying to be held on race day: Sunday. Monday is a national holiday meaning the race could be pushed back a day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77h041f76td1n036om62</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7K-PCN1-F0J6-J0X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"221\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Not only did the Wallabies win against Georgia, putting them through to the finals, but our flight would later be cancelled anyway.</p><p>The rain had begun as we made our way to the stadium that night and we thanked our lucky stars for the $20 ponchos we bought at Disneyland Tokyo a few weeks beforehand. They certainly came in handy as the rain bucketed down during the kilometre-long walk from the station to the stadium. It was the heaviest rain we'd seen in a long time.</p><p>At the end of the night, before heading back to our hotel, we decided to go to the nearest 7-eleven and stock up on some essentials - pringles, kit-kats, water and beer - to get us through the following day.</p><p>We were advised to stay indoors on Saturday, and ensure we had enough food and water and that our phones were charged.</p><p>The next morning we woke to news that a man had already been killed as a result of the typhoon, when the car he was driving flipped over in the wind. Thousands of residents in the Shizuoka prefecture, the prefecture we were in, had also been evacuated.</p><p>We were, however, safe where we were staying in Shizuoka city. The rain was still steady and we decided to brave it to see if the McDonald's a few blocks away was open, as we were craving a cheeseburger after a few too many drinks the night before.</p><p>What awaited us was a far cry from the bustling neighborhood we'd seen just the night before - the streets were all but deserted and everything was shut, including Maccas, as the rain and wind got heavier and stronger.</p><p>The only place open in the vicinity was an Indian restaurant, so we ate there, filling our bellies while we could, as we feared we may not be able to venture outside come dinner time, when the typhoon was expected to hit.</p><p>Back in the safety of our tiny hotel room, we spent the next few hours watching movies before joining a British trio for drinks in the hotel lobby. What better way to wait out a typhoon than with the nine per cent cans of vodka lemons that were readily available in convenience stores?</p><p>We enjoyed noodles in a cup for dinner that night, and when the rain ceased outside we figured we were in the eye of the storm.</p><p>During the break in rain we, along with our new British friends, decided to try our luck and see if there was a bar open showing the only Rugby World Cup game not cancelled that day, between Ireland and Samoa.</p><p>After spending what seemed like forever searching for a bar that was not only open but was also showing the game, we finally found one. By the time the game was over we went outside and the rain still hadn't returned. It seemed as if the storm had passed and it wasn't as bad as predicted. We'd survived the typhoon!</p><p>The next day saw blue skies and streets once again filled with people; there were even markets on. It was hard to imagine a typhoon had just come through. However, we were lucky. We were in a higher area that luckily escaped much of the damage and devastation that Typhoon Hagibis brought.</p><p>So far the death toll is 74 people, and counting, with more than a dozen still missing.</p><p>More than 5000 people are still in evacuation centres and more than 12,000 homes remain without power or running water.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis also caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with a number of trains damaged by flooding.</p><p>Calum and I were two of those people affected by transport disruptions; the biggest impact to us was that our flight ended up being cancelled, which, in the scheme of things is pretty insignificant. In fact, that cancellation gave us an extra three days in Japan.</p><p>We're finally on our way home after a holiday we'll never forget. We just hope that this time next year, wherever we may be, we are not in the path of a typhoon, hurricane or cyclone.</p><p>Sophie Harris is the Moree Champion's senior journalist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MORCHA-doc77k73en5bkmfxid072p</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MORCHA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8X-S271-F0J6-J28T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390598</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

For such masterful disguise of his actual feelings, Townsend should be awarded the Nobel Prize for diplomacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In public, Scotland are projecting confidence that what should be a quarter-final decider in Yokohama will take place tomorrow, pointing to the sunny skies that are forecast to follow Typhoon Hagibis into Tokyo. They also believe that should the destruction wrought by what are predicted to be 241km/h winds render the Yokohama Stadium unfit for purpose then there are several alternative venues within the city where the match could be restaged. Much of this flies in the face of World Rugby's assessments.</p><p>After tournament director Alan Gilpin stated there would be no contingency plans if the game could not go ahead, the Scottish Rugby Union released a statement saying \"it fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch\". Spot the difference.</p><p>The mood within the Scottish camp is best described as quietly seething. What a change from Monday, when it was pool A rivals Ireland's game against Samoa in Fukuoka that seemed to be under threat. Back then, what was labelled \"Typhoon Haggis\" was Scotland's ally sent to blow the Irish off course. It is no longer a laughing matter. Assuming Ireland pick up at least one point from their match against Samoa tonight, cancellation would result in a 0-0 draw being recorded and Scotland's elimination.</p><p>Suddenly the permutations of pool A in which Scotland need to claim four more match points than Japan do not seem half as complicated as ascertaining whether World Rugby would be in breach of its own regulations by cancelling the game.</p><p>A precedent has already been set by the governing body's decision to cancel the England v France and Italy v New Zealand fixtures that were due to take place today. However unlikely it may seem, Italy could have qualified with a bonus-point victory against the All Blacks. There is clearly far more on the line between Scotland and Japan, but World Rugby has insisted that it cannot apply special treatment and must abide by tournament rules that state pool games that cannot be fulfilled on specified dates should be declared draws.</p><p>Privately, Scottish officials are furious and dispute this interpretation of World Rugby's own rules, believing cancellation would damage the integrity of the tournament. As far as they are concerned, cup organisers have the power to overlook the regulations in order for matches to be fulfilled. They also point to provisions for a force majeure in the tournament participation agreement which includes a \"storm or tempest\", a description Typhoon Hagibis certainly fits. Organisers will make a final decision on the match six hours before the 9.45pm kick-off, by which time it is hoped Hagibis would have departed.</p><p>Nevertheless, Townsend remains confident the fixture can go ahead, even if it is played behind closed doors. \"I would hope that everyone who is involved in the tournament would want the game to be played and that they will do all they can to ensure that it is,\" Townsend said.</p><p>The question becomes what recourse does the SRU have if the match is cancelled. World Rugby has stated that all teams agreed to these regulations, so there is not expected to be a legal comeback. The SRU did not completely rule out sending for the lawyers, expressing confidence that the match would go ahead. Conspiracy theorists believe World Rugby want Japan to advance at Scotland's expense.</p><p>What should have been the match that put the tournament into the stratosphere now threatens to stain its legacy.

The Rugby World Cup organising committee will hold a media briefing in Tokyo at 2pm AEDT on Thursday.</p><p>France are likely to be furious as it robs them of the chance to top Pool C and play the runner-up of Pool D (likely to be Australia), thereby setting up a potentially easier path through the final four.</p><p>England sit atop Pool C on 15 points with France trailing by two on 13 points. Argentina's win over USA on Wednesday afternoon was not enough to help them qualify for the knockout stages. The 2015 semi-finalists will exit the tournament in coming days.</p><p>In Pool D, Australia and Wales are guaranteed quarter final spots. The only way the Wallabies could top the pool is if they beat Georgia on Friday and the Welsh lost to Uruguay on Sunday.</p><p>If Australia beat Georgia and the Wales v Uruguay game in Kumamoto is also called off, it will make no difference to the final pool standings, with the Wallabies and Wales level on points but Wales on top having beaten Australia in the pool stages.</p><p>Hagibis is expected to deliver lashing rain and damaging winds of up to 270km/h, hitting Japan's southern island of Honshu over the weekend.</p><p>Games in Yokohama are expected to be the worst affected, including the Pool C game between England and France on Saturday and the Pool A showdown between Japan and Scotland on Sunday.</p><p>The Brave Blossoms are topping the pool on 14 points with Ireland on 11 and Scotland on 10. Assuming Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday, the winner of Sunday's game in Yokohama will determine which teams go through to the knock out rounds.</p><p>On Wednesday Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said his side were preparing as usual for the game.</p><p>\"I had a look at the weather app and it does look like it is heading into Tokyo this weekend,\" Townsend said after his team's 61-0 bonus point win over Russia. \"It is a few days away and it could miss the Tokyo area or could still go there.\"</p><p>Tournament rules state that any pool game which cannot be played will not be rescheduled and instead be recorded as a 0-0 draw, with bonus points unavailable. That would ensure Scotland fail to reach the quarter-finals for just the second time in the tournament's history.</p><p>Townsend said he was unsure whether World Rugby had back-up plans. Earlier on Wednesday media reports suggested the England v France game would be moved to Oita, on Japan's southern island of Kyushu.</p><p>\"We will be getting updates from World Rugby over the next two days over what the contingencies are,\" Townsend said.</p><p>\"I am sure that alternative venues or arrangements are being looked at. Not just our game, but England and France play in the same stadium the night before.</p><p>\"I don't know if that's getting looked at for the Ireland-Samoa game (on Saturday) as well, with it being first forecast as (hitting) Fukuoka.\"</p><p>Townsend said he felt his players had done what was required on Wednesday to put themselves in position to dash the hopes of the tournament hosts of reaching the knock-out stages for the first time.</p><p>\"It was a tough game,\" Townsend said. \"The scoreline doesn't suggest that, but the effort that went into getting that scoreline by putting pressure on the Russian defence to open up spaces was huge from my players.</p><p>\"Getting the bonus point ... we knew that if we hadn't got that, Sunday would have been difficult, so getting that was excellent.</p><p>\"Getting a big score will also keep things interesting for Saturday, as well with the Ireland-Samoa game.</p><p>\"But also for the confidence - the players know that for two games now we haven't conceded a point, that's very encouraging.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More to come</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520191497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7D-2C31-JBJ7-N1P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><timeReceived>02:09 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

While the rest of the rugby world coiled itself in knots over whether or not the game would, or could, be played, the death toll climbed into the dozens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The typhoon affected so many people and there were some casualties. Although we really wanted to clear the game, we couldn't make a decision by ourselves, for our sakes,\" Japan's loosehead prop, Keita Inagaki said.</p><p>\"When we were told the game would be played we thought this was an opportunity to energise, revitalise the Japanese people and also the victims, those who lost people. As rugby players we thought this was something we thought we could do.</p><p>\"As a result we won the game and we thought this could be an opportunity for us to give courage to people who were affected by the typhoon.\"</p><p>Inagaki is the mop-haired prop whose support play finished off one of the most exquisite tries seen at this World Cup. Attacking, up tempo rugby at its best, the Brave Blossoms showed what magic can happen when you keep the ball alive.</p><p>As the roars grew ever louder at Yokohama International Stadium, their daring breathed the Yokohama and Tokyo communities back to life.</p><p>\"It was the best feeling I could ever have,\" a solemn and emotional Inagaki said.</p><p>\"Everyone was under pressure because the game was in Japan, but because it was held in Japan I thought we could enjoy this loud crowd.</p><p>\"Despite the weather, despite the typhoon, we could make this happen. I'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the staff members who made it happen.\"</p><p>Two Australians were also part of Japan's 28-21 win, which sealed their spot in the World Cup knockout rounds for the first time.</p><p>Former North Queensland Cowboys and Western Force back Will Tupou wore the No.15 jersey, and James Moore started in the second row. Both came out of Brisbane State High School, and plied their trade in the Top League before being picked for the Sunwolves and qualifying for the Brave Blossoms under World Rugby's three-year residency rule.</p><p>Just like their coaches, New Zealanders Jamie Joseph, Tony Brown and Scott Hansen, Tupou and Moore showed what commitment to a common cause could produce.</p><p>\"I am from Australia but I am proud to wear the Japanjersey and we are thankful for the fans,\" Tupou said.</p><p>\"I never thought I would be in Japan for this long and to have this opportunity to play in a World Cup team for Japan. I am so glad I stayed a bit longer, and just so grateful for the opportunity.\"</p><p>By Sunday, the death toll from Hagibis had climbed past 30. Japan paid tribute to the stricken families and communities before turning their attention to a quarter final clash with South Africa at Tokyo Stadium.</p><p>The teams met in a World Cup warm up and the Springboks smashed the Blossoms 41-7. Although their rise from tier two surprise packets to World Cup contenders can be traced back to the 2015 upset between the two nations, last month's loss will be the more relevant touch stone.</p><p>\"We faced them two weeks before the World Cup and were pretty poor. We need to try to take something from that,\" Moore said.</p><p>\"We had a couple of beers in the changing room and the guys won't go out tonight. It's chill and focus on South Africa [on Monday].\"</p><p>In an indication of how much the squad put into Sunday's pool game, captain Michael Leitch did not know who they would play in the quarter final.</p><p>His coach knew the permutations, however, and you got the sense the staff were already plotting Japan's fourth major World Cup scalp.</p><p>They will have to drown out what Joseph calls the \"noise\" around his team of brave, suprising and - for their country in a dark hour - inspirational men.</p><p>\"Walking into a hotel with people clapping, come out of the station and 50 people parting the way like royalty. It's a bit different, especially for me, from a small village in New Zealand,\" Joseph said.</p><p>\"If we are honest with what we need to do, we need to limit it (the noise) as much as possible. We understand we are representing the nation and the players are buying into it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520193029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8D-3YY1-JBJ7-N2XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"715\"/><timeReceived>02:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
