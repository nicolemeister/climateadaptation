Hopping between three, writes Mercedes Maguire</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first few tentative steps atop the white snowy caps of New Zealand's Southern Alps are not what I expected. From a distance, the ancient glaciers appear as a soft blanket of freshly fallen snow blanketing the mountaintops, not the hard, compacted ice we find when our helicopter lands among Fiordland National Park's highest peaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Edmund Hillary climbed that peak three times in training before he tackled Everest,\" our pilot says, pointing at Mount Tutoko. \"Sadly, these glaciers are disappearing. I remember seeing those mountain peaks covered in snow, not exposed like that.\" His commentary forces me to put down my camera and take in the precious moment; breathe in the crisp, clean air and marvel at the silence and glaring whiteness stretched out before me.</p><p>We were picked up from the front lawn of Blanket Bay luxury lodge for a helitour of Fiordland National Park. En route, our pilot points out the remote cabin on the edge of Lake Wakatipu where Brad Pitt's still-in-production film Heart of the Beast recently wrapped filming, and fans of The Lord of the Rings and Mission Impossible: Fallout movies will recognise the scenery of the lake sandwiched between mountains.</p><p>The Southern Alps is the final stop in a multi-lodge holiday of New Zealand. New Zealand's lodges are different to those anywhere else - often in remote, natural settings, they offer the perfect combo of intimate service, amazing food and genuine sustainability. I like to think of this trip, which will include a stay in three of the country's best luxury lodges, as a bit like an island-hopping adventure with a twist - lodge leaping, perhaps?</p><p>First stop Otahuna Lodge may be just 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport, but it has getting-away-from-it-all vibes. The seven-room Queen Anne mansion - built in 1895 by politician Sir Heaton Rhodes for his new bride, Jessie - comes into view on approach along the long gravel driveway.</p><p>Hall Cannon and Miles Refo took on the then-crumbling pile in 2006 (left derelict after its time as a Christian monastery and a 1960s hippie commune), opening the largest private historic property in New Zealand after a year-long restoration.</p><p>My room is a light-drenched space styled in modern Victorian with high ceilings, a wood-burning fireplace and a large recessed picture window overlooking the grounds.</p><p>It was once the room of the lady of the house, and I'm happy to be its latest occupant, even if it's just for the night. While the lodge operates as a fine hotel under the Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux banner, it feels more like I'm a guest in a private country home, each room a perfect blend of authentic old and comfortable new. There's no minibar or television in my room, for example, because they didn't have them in Jessie's time. But on the main landing, an old timber sideboard serving as a shared minibar heaves with freshly baked friands and Anzac biscuits, tea, coffee and cold drinks.</p><p>The extensive gardens were remodelled into a series of spaces that are like living jewellery boxes - the Dutch garden, rose garden, orchard and a 130-variety fruit and vegetable patch that inspires executive chef Jimmy McIntyre's seasonal menus. Guests are encouraged to book cooking demonstrations and garden tours for the full experience.</p><p>Hall waves us off the next morning, after a country breakfast that included a delicious multigrain no-knead bread made from a 100-year-old recipe in New Zealand's beloved Edmonds Cookery Book, farm fresh eggs, homemade jams, honey and muesli.</p><p>North Island hop A short plane trip to Wellington and a helicopter ride across the water (or a 90-minute drive) takes us to our second stop, Wharekauhau. If Otahuna Lodge is reminiscent of an old English hunting lodge, Wharekauhau is more like a luxe farmstay, cradled between the Remutaka mountains and Palliser Bay.</p><p>The main building is the hub for meals, activity-planning, evening drinks, exercise or just a place to hang out, while the accommodation is away from the lodge in 16 cottage suites and a villa.</p><p>Wharekauhau has a dedicated \"activity outfitter\" and planning your days over cocktails in the formal lounge is all part of the experience. We toured the 1200ha estate on ATV quad bikes (keeping an eye out for movie-director neighbour James Cameron), hand-fed eels, went clay-target shooting and walked the black-sand beach at Palliser Bay - and that was without leaving the estate. A 45-minute drive takes you to the charming town of Martinborough, a great spot for lunch and shopping and the home of Lighthouse Gin, run by New Zealand's first female head distiller, Rachel Hall.</p><p>Refusing to get caught up in the \"crazy-flavoured gin trend\", Hall produces a core range of three gins: Original, Navy Strength and Barrel Aged, all made using nine botanicals and spring water from Wharekauhau.</p><p>And back south The luxury lodge trifecta finishes at picture-perfect Blanket Bay, 45 minutes from Queenstown Airport. There are eight rooms in the main lodge plus four chalets and a four-bedroom villa elsewhere on the estate.</p><p>The area is a perfect base for adventure activities like horse riding, ziplining, bungee jumping, helifishing, hiking and jetboating. But with a helipad on the grounds, flights over nearby Milford Sound and the glaciers of the Southern Alps are the ultimate local experience.</p><p>Our pilot tells us that what appears to be dirt on the glacier tops is actually ash from Australian bushfires. That doesn't stop me bending to scoop the water, drip-fed from a glacier to a small steam, into my mouth. It's crisp, perfectly chilled and delicious. And after a week of pure indulgence, it seems like a fitting finale to New Zealand.</p><p>The writer was a guest of Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux.</p><p>Escape contributor Mercedes Maguire can now add these skills to her repertoire: ATV quad-bike driver, glacial water sommelier, gin enthusiast and clay target sharpshooter (okay, that's probably going a bit far).</p><p>.</p><p>ESCAPE ROUTE STAYING THERE Otahuna, 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport.

New Zealand is a small enough place to do it, with the help of domestic flights and the occasional helicopter.</p><p>Otahuna Lodge, a 30-minute drive from Christchurch's international airport, is the lodge I imagine in my dreams. The seven-guestroom stately home, built in 1895 as the residence of politician Sir Heaton Rhodes, has had a checkered history over the past 50 years (it was a seminary, then a commune, then derelict) before being rescued by partners Hall Cannon and Miles Refo, who poured love and buckets of money into a complete restoration, opening the house to guests in 2007. You can see why they love it. Otahuna has the distinction of being the largest private historic residence in New Zealand and one of the best examples of Queen Anne architecture in Australasia.</p><p>Heartbreakingly, the earthquake of 2010 damaged the house, but that didn't deter the new owners, who supervised repairs and reopened it the following year. The original, ornate Rimu panelling, the hand-carved Kauri staircase and the 16 fireplaces, some with their carved inglenooks, survive, as well as the exquisite, embossed Japanese Kinkarakami wallpaper in the dining room, originally installed by Sir Heaton's wife Jessie.</p><p>You couldn't find a more charming host than the garrulous, Memphis-born Cannon, who has restored the property with such love, he's even kept the original switchboard Sir Heaton used.</p><p>But it doesn't feel like a museum. Guest rooms have been decorated with aplomb in Colefax &amp; Fowler and Pierre Frey fabrics, bespoke furniture and all mod cons, such as heated bathroom floors.</p><p>I stay in the gorgeous attic suite, The Loft, which includes its own door to Narnia in the cupboard. There are several such witty touches throughout the property, such as the chicken coop named Ota-hen-a. And, past the heated outdoor pool, there's a croquet lawn, of course. Cute, black-nosed sheep occupy one of the paddocks.</p><p>The 12 hectares of gardens are magnificent, with woodlands, orchards, flower gardens and a vast organic vegetable and herb garden from which chef Jimmy McIntyre draws his ingredients.</p><p>The cooking is off the charts in terms of flavour, using garden produce such as prosciutto and ham from the farm's pigs and fresh eggs from the chickens. Breakfast is a total delight in the big, country kitchen, with preserves, pickles and chutneys from the garden.</p><p>Otahuna is famous for its carpets of daffodils in spring. More than a million bulbs have been planted and about 100,000 of these bloom every year. In autumn, formal gardens with their red benches are a riot of reddish colours and mossy greens.</p><p>After the cosy stay, it's a flight to Wellington and then a quick helicopter transport to Wharekauhau (pronounced foray-ko-ho), a working sheep station with 16 cottages and a villa set atop dramatic 62-metre-tall cliffs overlooking Palliser Bay on the very south of the North Island.</p><p>Wellington has been nicknamed \"Wellywood\" for its vibrant film industry, and the lush neighbouring fields we fly over belong to US film director James Cameron, who has been instrumental (with Peter Jackson) in the industry's boom. The landscape is wrapped in the peaks of the Remutaka mountain range.</p><p>Wharekauhau was one of the first purpose-built lodges in New Zealand when it opened in 1998. It's now owned by American entertainment mogul William Foley, who loved it so much as a guest that he bought the property in 2010. Foley has a stake in a number of local vineyards in nearby Martinborough, which also produce Lighthouse, the craft gin made by Rachel Hall, New Zealand's only female gin distiller.</p><p>The lodge, set on 1200 hectares, is supremely comfortable, with plush country house-style interiors by Victoria Fisher. The cottages all have canopy beds, sitting rooms by gas fireplaces, large bathrooms and wide verandas facing the ocean. Because of the spectacular storms in the region, storm watching and stargazing are the lodge's most popular activities.</p><p>Fine dining and drinking New Zealand's famous wines are too, of course. There's a dedicated edible garden which supplies the chefs - and there's a head forager, Jack Fredrickson, an Australian who ventures far and wide on his quad bike to find wild ingredients for the dishes.</p><p>The main lodge has room after room of overstuffed furniture and beautiful objects and art, a glasshouse with pool, spa and gym, tennis courts, croquet lawn, games room, library and two restaurants. Every detail is immaculate, in line with the expectations of guests.</p><p>Walks down country lanes to visit the sheep are invigorating. And then there are activities such as ATV and quad bike excursions on the moody black sand beach scattered with bleached driftwood, and clay pigeon shooting at stations along the river. (When the zombie apocalypse comes, I'm not going to be much help - I hit one target out of about 20.)</p><p>It's a domestic flight from Wellington to Queenstown and on by car to Blanket Bay Lodge, which sits on the far reaches of Lake Wakatipu, near the village of Glenorchy.</p><p>With the Southern Alps framed in every window, the setting has an undoubted wow factor and the lodge itself, a lofty chalet lined with recycled wharf and woolshed timber polished with wool lanolin, is as spectacular as the surrounds.</p><p>It's filled with delightful ephemera - antler chandeliers, taxidermy deer and ducks, displays of birds' nests, saddles, fishing rods and bales of wool - which makes it feel like a cross between a swank Aspen chalet and a hunting lodge.</p><p>Opened in 1999 and developed by American Tom Tusher, a keen fisherman, the lodge consists of five lakeside lodge rooms and five suites in the main building, plus two chalet suites and an exclusive-use villa with four bedrooms and private chefs on tap. (Kylie Minogue is a past guest, as are a number of movie stars when in New Zealand to shoot Wellywood productions.)</p><p>There are stone hearths and fireplaces throughout, with afternoon teas, cocktails and delicious, chewy cookies served by the fire. (Each cookie arrives topped with a gilded chocolate \"B\" - an example of the superb attention to detail throughout the lodge.)</p><p>The gastronomy is refined, with dinner an ever-changing five-course degustation sourced from New Zealand regions, such as organic chicken from nearby farms and kingfish sashimi from local waters. As with all the lodges, full farm breakfasts are a highlight of the day.</p><p>Why venture outside? Well, there's the lakefront and peninsula woodlands and sheep farms to explore on foot, plus the world-famous hiking trails on the Alps.</p><p>One of the experiences is a jet boat adventure along the Dart River, which is a couple of hours of screaming and getting soaked as the driver does countless \"wheelies\" in the cold water. Next time, I'll take a slow boat.</p><p>The big draw is the great Lord of the Rings landscapes of the Southern Alps and Milford Sound. The way to see it all is by helicopter. Our helicopter lands directly on the lawn, scooping us up and darting along the lake and into the jagged mountain peaks of the Fiordland National Park.</p><p>The two-hour trip includes a thrilling landing and walk on the ever-shrinking glacier in the peaks. It's not pristine - the ice is still covered with ash from the Australian bushfires in 2018. Then we chopper down to Milford Sound and land at the airport, which is squeezed between mountain and waterfalls, and must be one of the busiest in the world, judging by the number of small planes landing and taking off.</p><p>Back at the lodge, there's a roaring fire in the hearth, cups of tea and those moreish cookies.w</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc818pi5b6bc215yw78bpv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4W-53V3-SCBN-7085-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun Herald (Sydney, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 29, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DI87</classCode><className>CROQUET</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DN61</classCode><className>AGRITOURISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DO78</classCode><className>ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DIHV</classCode><className>FURNITURE &amp; FURNISHINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX639</classCode><className>CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

New Zealand is a small enough place to do it, with the help of domestic flights and the occasional helicopter.</p><p>Otahuna Lodge, a 30-minute drive from Christchurch's international airport, is the lodge I imagine in my dreams. The seven-guestroom stately home, built in 1895 as the residence of politician Sir Heaton Rhodes, has had a checkered history over the past 50 years (it was a seminary, then a commune, then derelict) before being rescued by partners Hall Cannon and Miles Refo, who poured love and buckets of money into a complete restoration, opening the house to guests in 2007. You can see why they love it. Otahuna has the distinction of being the largest private historic residence in New Zealand and one of the best examples of Queen Anne architecture in Australasia.</p><p>Heartbreakingly, the earthquake of 2010 damaged the house, but that didn't deter the new owners, who supervised repairs and reopened it the following year. The original, ornate Rimu panelling, the hand-carved Kauri staircase and the 16 fireplaces, some with their carved inglenooks, survive, as well as the exquisite, embossed Japanese Kinkarakami wallpaper in the dining room, originally installed by Sir Heaton's wife Jessie.</p><p>You couldn't find a more charming host than the garrulous, Memphis-born Cannon, who has restored the property with such love, he's even kept the original switchboard Sir Heaton used.</p><p>But it doesn't feel like a museum. Guest rooms have been decorated with aplomb in Colefax &amp; Fowler and Pierre Frey fabrics, bespoke furniture and all mod cons, such as heated bathroom floors.</p><p>I stay in the gorgeous attic suite, The Loft, which includes its own door to Narnia in the cupboard. There are several such witty touches throughout the property, such as the chicken coop named Ota-hen-a. And, past the heated outdoor pool, there's a croquet lawn, of course. Cute, black-nosed sheep occupy one of the paddocks.</p><p>The 12 hectares of gardens are magnificent, with woodlands, orchards, flower gardens and a vast organic vegetable and herb garden from which chef Jimmy McIntyre draws his ingredients.</p><p>The cooking is off the charts in terms of flavour, using garden produce such as prosciutto and ham from the farm's pigs and fresh eggs from the chickens. Breakfast is a total delight in the big, country kitchen, with preserves, pickles and chutneys from the garden.</p><p>Otahuna is famous for its carpets of daffodils in spring. More than a million bulbs have been planted and about 100,000 of these bloom every year. In autumn, formal gardens with their red benches are a riot of reddish colours and mossy greens.</p><p>After the cosy stay, it's a flight to Wellington and then a quick helicopter transport to Wharekauhau (pronounced foray-ko-ho), a working sheep station with 16 cottages and a villa set atop dramatic 62-metre-tall cliffs overlooking Palliser Bay on the very south of the North Island.</p><p>Wellington has been nicknamed \"Wellywood\" for its vibrant film industry, and the lush neighbouring fields we fly over belong to US film director James Cameron, who has been instrumental (with Peter Jackson) in the industry's boom. The landscape is wrapped in the peaks of the Remutaka mountain range.</p><p>Wharekauhau was one of the first purpose-built lodges in New Zealand when it opened in 1998. It's now owned by American entertainment mogul William Foley, who loved it so much as a guest that he bought the property in 2010. Foley has a stake in a number of local vineyards in nearby Martinborough, which also produce Lighthouse, the craft gin made by Rachel Hall, New Zealand's only female gin distiller.</p><p>The lodge, set on 1200 hectares, is supremely comfortable, with plush country house-style interiors by Victoria Fisher. The cottages all have canopy beds, sitting rooms by gas fireplaces, large bathrooms and wide verandas facing the ocean. Because of the spectacular storms in the region, storm watching and stargazing are the lodge's most popular activities.</p><p>Fine dining and drinking New Zealand's famous wines are too, of course. There's a dedicated edible garden which supplies the chefs - and there's a head forager, Jack Fredrickson, an Australian who ventures far and wide on his quad bike to find wild ingredients for the dishes.</p><p>The main lodge has room after room of overstuffed furniture and beautiful objects and art, a glasshouse with pool, spa and gym, tennis courts, croquet lawn, games room, library and two restaurants. Every detail is immaculate, in line with the expectations of guests.</p><p>Walks down country lanes to visit the sheep are invigorating. And then there are activities such as ATV and quad bike excursions on the moody black sand beach scattered with bleached driftwood, and clay pigeon shooting at stations along the river. (When the zombie apocalypse comes, I'm not going to be much help - I hit one target out of about 20.)</p><p>It's a domestic flight from Wellington to Queenstown and on by car to Blanket Bay Lodge, which sits on the far reaches of Lake Wakatipu, near the village of Glenorchy.</p><p>With the Southern Alps framed in every window, the setting has an undoubted wow factor and the lodge itself, a lofty chalet lined with recycled wharf and woolshed timber polished with wool lanolin, is as spectacular as the surrounds.</p><p>It's filled with delightful ephemera - antler chandeliers, taxidermy deer and ducks, displays of birds' nests, saddles, fishing rods and bales of wool - which makes it feel like a cross between a swank Aspen chalet and a hunting lodge.</p><p>Opened in 1999 and developed by American Tom Tusher, a keen fisherman, the lodge consists of five lakeside lodge rooms and five suites in the main building, plus two chalet suites and an exclusive-use villa with four bedrooms and private chefs on tap. (Kylie Minogue is a past guest, as are a number of movie stars when in New Zealand to shoot Wellywood productions.)</p><p>There are stone hearths and fireplaces throughout, with afternoon teas, cocktails and delicious, chewy cookies served by the fire. (Each cookie arrives topped with a gilded chocolate \"B\" - an example of the superb attention to detail throughout the lodge.)</p><p>The gastronomy is refined, with dinner an ever-changing five-course degustation sourced from New Zealand regions, such as organic chicken from nearby farms and kingfish sashimi from local waters. As with all the lodges, full farm breakfasts are a highlight of the day.</p><p>Why venture outside? Well, there's the lakefront and peninsula woodlands and sheep farms to explore on foot, plus the world-famous hiking trails on the Alps.</p><p>One of the experiences is a jet boat adventure along the Dart River, which is a couple of hours of screaming and getting soaked as the driver does countless \"wheelies\" in the cold water. Next time, I'll take a slow boat.</p><p>The big draw is the great Lord of the Rings landscapes of the Southern Alps and Milford Sound. The way to see it all is by helicopter. Our helicopter lands directly on the lawn, scooping us up and darting along the lake and into the jagged mountain peaks of the Fiordland National Park.</p><p>The two-hour trip includes a thrilling landing and walk on the ever-shrinking glacier in the peaks. It's not pristine - the ice is still covered with ash from the Australian bushfires in 2018. Then we chopper down to Milford Sound and land at the airport, which is squeezed between mountain and waterfalls, and must be one of the busiest in the world, judging by the number of small planes landing and taking off.</p><p>Back at the lodge, there's a roaring fire in the hearth, cups of tea and those moreish cookies.w</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc818pi9vrprdcrdvdbpv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4W-53V3-SCBN-7046-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 29, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DI87</classCode><className>CROQUET</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DN61</classCode><className>AGRITOURISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DO78</classCode><className>ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DIHV</classCode><className>FURNITURE &amp; FURNISHINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX639</classCode><className>CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Hopping between three, writes Mercedes Maguire</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first few tentative steps atop the white snowy caps of New Zealand's Southern Alps are not what I expected. From a distance, the ancient glaciers appear as a soft blanket of freshly fallen snow blanketing the mountaintops, not the hard, compacted ice we find when our helicopter lands among Fiordland National Park's highest peaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Edmund Hillary climbed that peak three times in training before he tackled Everest,\" our pilot says, pointing at Mount Tutoko. \"Sadly, these glaciers are disappearing. I remember seeing those mountain peaks covered in snow, not exposed like that.\" His commentary forces me to put down my camera and take in the precious moment; breathe in the crisp, clean air and marvel at the silence and glaring whiteness stretched out before me.</p><p>We were picked up from the front lawn of Blanket Bay luxury lodge for a helitour of Fiordland National Park. En route, our pilot points out the remote cabin on the edge of Lake Wakatipu where Brad Pitt's still-in-production film Heart of the Beast recently wrapped filming, and fans of The Lord of the Rings and Mission Impossible: Fallout movies will recognise the scenery of the lake sandwiched between mountains.</p><p>The Southern Alps is the final stop in a multi-lodge holiday of New Zealand. New Zealand's lodges are different to those anywhere else - often in remote, natural settings, they offer the perfect combo of intimate service, amazing food and genuine sustainability. I like to think of this trip, which will include a stay in three of the country's best luxury lodges, as a bit like an island-hopping adventure with a twist - lodge leaping, perhaps?</p><p>First stop Otahuna Lodge may be just 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport, but it has getting-away-from-it-all vibes. The seven-room Queen Anne mansion - built in 1895 by politician Sir Heaton Rhodes for his new bride, Jessie - comes into view on approach along the long gravel driveway.</p><p>Hall Cannon and Miles Refo took on the then-crumbling pile in 2006 (left derelict after its time as a Christian monastery and a 1960s hippie commune), opening the largest private historic property in New Zealand after a year-long restoration.</p><p>My room is a light-drenched space styled in modern Victorian with high ceilings, a wood-burning fireplace and a large recessed picture window overlooking the grounds.</p><p>It was once the room of the lady of the house, and I'm happy to be its latest occupant, even if it's just for the night. While the lodge operates as a fine hotel under the Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux banner, it feels more like I'm a guest in a private country home, each room a perfect blend of authentic old and comfortable new. There's no minibar or television in my room, for example, because they didn't have them in Jessie's time. But on the main landing, an old timber sideboard serving as a shared minibar heaves with freshly baked friands and Anzac biscuits, tea, coffee and cold drinks.</p><p>The extensive gardens were remodelled into a series of spaces that are like living jewellery boxes - the Dutch garden, rose garden, orchard and a 130-variety fruit and vegetable patch that inspires executive chef Jimmy McIntyre's seasonal menus. Guests are encouraged to book cooking demonstrations and garden tours for the full experience.</p><p>Hall waves us off the next morning, after a country breakfast that included a delicious multigrain no-knead bread made from a 100-year-old recipe in New Zealand's beloved Edmonds Cookery Book, farm fresh eggs, homemade jams, honey and muesli.</p><p>North Island hop A short plane trip to Wellington and a helicopter ride across the water (or a 90-minute drive) takes us to our second stop, Wharekauhau. If Otahuna Lodge is reminiscent of an old English hunting lodge, Wharekauhau is more like a luxe farmstay, cradled between the Remutaka mountains and Palliser Bay.</p><p>The main building is the hub for meals, activity-planning, evening drinks, exercise or just a place to hang out, while the accommodation is away from the lodge in 16 cottage suites and a villa.</p><p>Wharekauhau has a dedicated \"activity outfitter\" and planning your days over cocktails in the formal lounge is all part of the experience. We toured the 1200ha estate on ATV quad bikes (keeping an eye out for movie-director neighbour James Cameron), hand-fed eels, went clay-target shooting and walked the black-sand beach at Palliser Bay - and that was without leaving the estate. A 45-minute drive takes you to the charming town of Martinborough, a great spot for lunch and shopping and the home of Lighthouse Gin, run by New Zealand's first female head distiller, Rachel Hall.</p><p>Refusing to get caught up in the \"crazy-flavoured gin trend\", Hall produces a core range of three gins: Original, Navy Strength and Barrel Aged, all made using nine botanicals and spring water from Wharekauhau.</p><p>And back south The luxury lodge trifecta finishes at picture-perfect Blanket Bay, 45 minutes from Queenstown Airport. There are eight rooms in the main lodge plus four chalets and a four-bedroom villa elsewhere on the estate.</p><p>The area is a perfect base for adventure activities like horse riding, ziplining, bungee jumping, helifishing, hiking and jetboating. But with a helipad on the grounds, flights over nearby Milford Sound and the glaciers of the Southern Alps are the ultimate local experience.</p><p>Our pilot tells us that what appears to be dirt on the glacier tops is actually ash from Australian bushfires. That doesn't stop me bending to scoop the water, drip-fed from a glacier to a small steam, into my mouth. It's crisp, perfectly chilled and delicious. And after a week of pure indulgence, it seems like a fitting finale to New Zealand.</p><p>The writer was a guest of Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux.</p><p>Escape contributor Mercedes Maguire can now add these skills to her repertoire: ATV quad-bike driver, glacial water sommelier, gin enthusiast and clay target sharpshooter (okay, that's probably going a bit far).</p><p>.</p><p>ESCAPE ROUTE STAYING THERE Otahuna, 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport.

Hopping between three, writes Mercedes Maguire The first few tentative steps atop the white snowy caps of New Zealand's Southern Alps are not what I expected. From a distance, the ancient glaciers appear as a soft blanket of freshly fallen snow blanketing the mountaintops, not the hard, compacted ice we find when our helicopter lands among Fiordland National Park's highest peaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Edmund Hillary climbed that peak three times in training before he tackled Everest,\" our pilot says, pointing at Mount Tutoko. \"Sadly, these glaciers are disappearing. I remember seeing those mountain peaks covered in snow, not exposed like that.\" His commentary forces me to put down my camera and take in the precious moment; breathe in the crisp, clean air and marvel at the silence and glaring whiteness stretched out before me.</p><p>We were picked up from the front lawn of Blanket Bay luxury lodge for a helitour of Fiordland National Park. En route, our pilot points out the remote cabin on the edge of Lake Wakatipu where Brad Pitt's still-in-production film Heart of the Beast recently wrapped filming, and fans of The Lord of the Rings and Mission Impossible: Fallout movies will recognise the scenery of the lake sandwiched between mountains.</p><p>The Southern Alps is the final stop in a multi-lodge holiday of New Zealand. New Zealand's lodges are different to those anywhere else - often in remote, natural settings, they offer the perfect combo of intimate service, amazing food and genuine sustainability. I like to think of this trip, which will include a stay in three of the country's best luxury lodges, as a bit like an island-hopping adventure with a twist - lodge leaping, perhaps?</p><p>First stop Otahuna Lodge may be just 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport, but it has getting-away-from-it-all vibes. The seven-room Queen Anne mansion - built in 1895 by politician Sir Heaton Rhodes for his new bride, Jessie - comes into view on approach along the long gravel driveway.</p><p>Hall Cannon and Miles Refo took on the then-crumbling pile in 2006 (left derelict after its time as a Christian monastery and a 1960s hippie commune), opening the largest private historic property in New Zealand after a year-long restoration.</p><p>My room is a light-drenched space styled in modern Victorian with high ceilings, a wood-burning fireplace and a large recessed picture window overlooking the grounds.</p><p>It was once the room of the lady of the house, and I'm happy to be its latest occupant, even if it's just for the night. While the lodge operates as a fine hotel under the Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux banner, it feels more like I'm a guest in a private country home, each room a perfect blend of authentic old and comfortable new. There's no minibar or television in my room, for example, because they didn't have them in Jessie's time. But on the main landing, an old timber sideboard serving as a shared minibar heaves with freshly baked friands and Anzac biscuits, tea, coffee and cold drinks.</p><p>The extensive gardens were remodelled into a series of spaces that are like living jewellery boxes - the Dutch garden, rose garden, orchard and a 130-variety fruit and vegetable patch that inspires executive chef Jimmy McIntyre's seasonal menus. Guests are encouraged to book cooking demonstrations and garden tours for the full experience.</p><p>Hall waves us off the next morning, after a country breakfast that included a delicious multigrain no-knead bread made from a 100-year-old recipe in New Zealand's beloved Edmonds Cookery Book, farm fresh eggs, homemade jams, honey and muesli.</p><p>North Island hop A short plane trip to Wellington and a helicopter ride across the water (or a 90-minute drive) takes us to our second stop, Wharekauhau. If Otahuna Lodge is reminiscent of an old English hunting lodge, Wharekauhau is more like a luxe farmstay, cradled between the Remutaka mountains and Palliser Bay.</p><p>The main building is the hub for meals, activity-planning, evening drinks, exercise or just a place to hang out, while the accommodation is away from the lodge in 16 cottage suites and a villa.</p><p>Wharekauhau has a dedicated \"activity outfitter\" and planning your days over cocktails in the formal lounge is all part of the experience. We toured the 1200ha estate on ATV quad bikes (keeping an eye out for movie-director neighbour James Cameron), hand-fed eels, went clay-target shooting and walked the black-sand beach at Palliser Bay - and that was without leaving the estate. A 45-minute drive takes you to the charming town of Martinborough, a great spot for lunch and shopping and the home of Lighthouse Gin, run by New Zealand's first female head distiller, Rachel Hall.</p><p>Refusing to get caught up in the \"crazy-flavoured gin trend\", Hall produces a core range of three gins: Original, Navy Strength and Barrel Aged, all made using nine botanicals and spring water from Wharekauhau.</p><p>And back south The luxury lodge trifecta finishes at picture-perfect Blanket Bay, 45 minutes from Queenstown Airport. There are eight rooms in the main lodge plus four chalets and a four-bedroom villa elsewhere on the estate.</p><p>The area is a perfect base for adventure activities like horse riding, ziplining, bungee jumping, helifishing, hiking and jetboating. But with a helipad on the grounds, flights over nearby Milford Sound and the glaciers of the Southern Alps are the ultimate local experience.</p><p>Our pilot tells us that what appears to be dirt on the glacier tops is actually ash from Australian bushfires. That doesn't stop me bending to scoop the water, drip-fed from a glacier to a small steam, into my mouth. It's crisp, perfectly chilled and delicious. And after a week of pure indulgence, it seems like a fitting finale to New Zealand.</p><p>The writer was a guest of Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux.</p><p>Escape contributor Mercedes Maguire can now add these skills to her repertoire: ATV quad-bike driver, glacial water sommelier, gin enthusiast and clay target sharpshooter (okay, that's probably going a bit far).</p><p>.</p><p>ESCAPE ROUTE STAYING THERE Otahuna, 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport.

Everyone was quiet. Seeing miles of fire, people were crying,\" Ms Geise said. </p><p>Another American traveller, 21-year-old student Devin, said the experience was \"insane.\" </p><p>\"I used to live in Southern California, so I saw smoke a lot, but this was bigger than anything I had ever seen. You could see the flames. I have some friends that go to UCLA, they have the ability to go home, but I know some people whose houses burnt down. It was crazy, said Devin, 21. </p><p>Australian woman Kathryn Salmon was wrapping up a family trip to America when the fires hit. </p><p>\"We had travelled from New York and done a cross country trip and finished in LA. On the Monday night the fires were quite bad so we had to be alert to know if they were coming around to Hollywood Hills. </p><p>\"There was a lot of smoke, we were staying in Hollywood, and then the day we left there was an outbreak near us. It was progressively getting bigger,\" Ms Salmon said. </p><p>\"Santa Monica pier almost shut down because of the fires,\" he said. </p><p>American friends Barry Epperson and John Fowler said they personally knew people whose homes were part of the more than 9,000 homes that have burnt down. </p><p>\"I have friends who lost homes, my daughter teaches at a school in Palisades which burnt down. </p><p>\"So many people are affected. I flew over last night and the [plane] cabin was filled with smoke, you could smell it,\" Mr Fowler said. </p><p>\"It's just devastating,\" said Mr Epperson, \"but the firefighters are doing an amazing job,\" he said. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Do you have a story for The Daily Telegraph?

From capturing stunning aerial videos to delivering packages, drones are transforming industries.<br/>But what's making drones smarter and more capable is the rapid advancement in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Autonomous drone technology is moving beyond simple remote-controlled machines to fully independent systems that can think, adapt, and make decisions on their own.</p><p><br/>One of the most important advancements in drone technology is the development of AI-powered navigation systems. Autonomous drones can now fly without direct human control, relying on sensors, cameras, and algorithms to map their surroundings and avoid obstacles.<br/>For example, drones equipped with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) can create detailed 3D maps of their environment in real-time. This allows them to navigate safely through forests, cities, or even inside buildings without crashing.<br/>Drones are also getting better at working together. Using a concept called \"swarm intelligence,\" researchers are developing drones that can communicate and coordinate with each other, just like a flock of birds or a school of fish.<br/>This technology is particularly useful in situations like disaster response, where multiple drones can work as a team to search for survivors, deliver supplies, or assess damage. For example, during the 2020 Australian bushfires, autonomous drones were used to monitor the spread of fires and guide firefighting efforts.<br/>Another breakthrough in autonomous drone technology is in object recognition and tracking. Thanks to machine learning, drones can now identify and follow specific objects or people. This is being used in agriculture, where drones can monitor crops and identify areas that need watering or pest control.<br/>Similarly, wildlife researchers are using drones to track animals and study their behavior without disturbing them. In the delivery industry, companies like Amazon and UPS are testing drones that can identify delivery locations and safely drop off packages.<br/>One of the most exciting applications of autonomous drones is in transportation. Urban air mobility is becoming a reality, with companies developing drone taxis that can carry passengers across cities.<br/>These drones use advanced robotics to ensure safe takeoffs, landings, and navigation through busy airspaces. While this technology is still in its early stages, it has the potential to revolutionize transportation and reduce traffic congestion.<br/>Autonomous drones are also making a big impact in environmental conservation. Drones equipped with sensors and cameras are being used to monitor deforestation, track illegal fishing, and even plant trees in hard-to-reach areas.<br/>Some drones can collect air quality data, helping scientists understand pollution patterns and find ways to combat climate change.<br/>The military is another area where autonomous drones are being heavily developed. These drones are used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and even combat missions. Autonomous systems allow drones to operate in dangerous environments without putting human lives at risk.<br/>However, the use of drones in warfare raises ethical concerns, particularly when it comes to fully autonomous weapons that can make life-and-death decisions without human oversight.<br/>As drones become more advanced, their potential uses continue to grow. Emergency response teams are using drones to deliver medical supplies to remote locations.<br/>Energy companies are deploying drones to inspect power lines and wind turbines, reducing the need for risky manual inspections. Even in the entertainment industry, drones are being used for light shows and creative filming techniques.<br/>While there are still challenges to overcome, such as improving battery life and addressing privacy concerns, the advancements in robotics for autonomous drones are opening up new possibilities across industries.<br/>By making drones smarter, safer, and more efficient, robotics is shaping a future where these flying machines will play an even bigger role in our everyday lives. From saving lives to protecting the environment, autonomous drones are proving that the sky is no longer the limit-it's just the beginning.<br/>Copyright \u00a9 2025 Knowridge Science Report.

The other - a largely sympathetic profile of \"troublesome beneficiary\" James Murdoch in The Atlantic - is more pointed and personal.</p><p>But both, beneath the splashy melodrama, make a fundamentally legal point. The attempt to alter the family trust has failed, and even upon appeal, will probably not succeed. Things are back in their holding pattern. Only now, that pattern is untenable.</p><p>Everyone hates Lachlan and is barely talking to Rupert. The solution?</p><p>A buyout of the troublesome siblings, on more agreeable terms than the 60 per cent of market value they'd been offered. Call it a veiled threat. As Prue, Liz and James told the Times: \"We are refraining from comment at this moment, because most of the litigation is still under seal.\" Key words: at this moment.</p><p>Of course, this is nothing less than a family divorce, and motivations aren't singular. In laying out his side of family tensions in The Atlantic, James gives every appearance of seeking a moral vindication. His father, he said, was \"a misogynist\" who never considered his daughters as potential successors. An uncaring patriarch who shows no interest in his grandchildren, and who organises sham family counselling retreats with the sole aim of isolating and controlling his troublesome son. And a \"twisted\" and inscrutable opponent, at one point in a deposition texting an attorney who called James and his sisters \"white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies\" with suggestions on where to push his son next.</p><p>There's no denying the Murdoch children have all done well out of the family business. Aside from a lifetime of assured privilege, each was paid $US2.1 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2019 for selling their stake of the company's entertainment assets to Disney. Further, the Sun King does not appear misguided about his troublesome son's antipathy for News Corp's editorial positioning. Asked what changes they want to see in the family's outlets, James' wife Kathryn makes a telling remark about Fox News. \"It doesn't have a clear purpose in the ecosystem any more,\" she says.</p><p>Reading that, yesterday, led Sydney broker and long-time Lachlan backer Angus Aitken to quip his thanks that neither James nor Kathryn have anything to do with the business. \"It is pretty obvious that if James did get his way ... it would have ended up like MSNBC and CNN: financially distressed with declining ratings, revenues and relevance,\" he said.</p><p>The profile is, in a sense, a rebuttal to such views, widely expressed in Australia and in the closed Nevada trial (where James was grilled on his business achievements). The younger Murdoch son is depicted as a suave, sophisticated bureaucrat who turned a loss-making Asian satellite subsidiary around and knew how to drive cultural and financial change within legacy businesses.</p><p>In the Times piece, it is the Murdoch women who dominate. Liz and Prue are close, frequently sharing emoji-laden messages of their fraught contact with their father and brothers.</p><p>Prue, the daughter from Rupert's first marriage to Patricia Booker, even advises Rupert on how to reach out to James, suggesting he talk to him about missing his grandchildren, rather than going heavy on the manoeuvring (\"I know. Not totally stupid,\" Rupert replies).</p><p>When Rupert later attempted to enlist his daughters' support in disenfranchising them of their birthright, they were stunned.</p><p>According to trial transcripts, Prue called her father and warned him about treating her and Liz like \"assistants\".</p><p>\"You already lost one son. And you could well lose two daughters over this,\" she tells him.</p><p>Liz, meanwhile, urged her father to find another solution, and told him he was misunderstanding James, to which Rupert responded that she'd been lobbied by James and \"you're going to bend to his will\".</p><p>\"Do you think I'm a f---ing moron,\" she replied.</p><p>She also tried appealing to Lachlan, telling him she'd always been his biggest supporter and that the trust changes were a \"massive gut punch\". Lachlan was unsympathetic.</p><p>\"Today is about dad's wishes and confirming all of our support for him and for his wishes. It shouldn't be difficult or controversial,\" he texted back.</p><p>Anna Murdoch - Rupert's second wife and the mother of Liz, Lachlan and James - also made an appearance. It is to her that Rupert tellingly tied the future of conservatism in the English-speaking world to the ascension of his oldest son.</p><p>\"Fox and our papers are the only faintly conservative voices against the monolithic liberal media,\" he wrote in an email. Anna didn't disagree, pushing her ex-husband to \"get things sorted out soon\".</p><p>\"Lachlan is the best to run the business ... James is very bright and articulate - but time and again showed poor judgment.\"</p><p>The Atlantic's story also makes much of James' shock and hurt at discovering his father and brother have leaked to the press against him. But it would be naive to think he does not do the same. Those sympathetic to Lachlan point out that when James broke from the News Corp narrative during the Australian bushfires in 2020, expressing his disappointment with \"the ongoing denial [of climate change] among the news outlets in Australia\", he did so through his own PR representative.</p><p>They are also sceptical that his present manoeuvring will work. Such mischief, they argue, will only harden Rupert's resolve. But this assumes a lot. After all, in the fullness of the appeals process, a Nevada courtroom may deny him and his chosen successor a choice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7zeirua56vtlgvh1qr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5K-MC03-S071-93Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It's a small area, but it's the high density and large number of dwellings that adds to the overall value.\"</p><p>Melcorp director Mark Giuliano said the suburb's housing market had an \"okay\" year in 2024, though could have performed quite strongly if there hadn't been significant numbers of homes for sale as a result of increased land tax costs. </p><p>\"But this year, the start of the year has had strong interest at inspections already,\" Mr Giuliano said.</p><p>He noted that the city had a two-speed market, with larger older apartments and the better designed newer ones typically doing quite well - while those built purely for investors were still often losing money.</p><p>Brighton was the city's next most valuable suburb, with its 10,923 homes worth a total of $25.837bn - edged out of top spot in Victoria as its median house price fell over the past year. It was Australia's fourth most valuable suburb.</p><p>JP Dixon boss Jonathan Dixon said the suburb had a tougher year in 2024, and home sales had struggled during an adjustment period for a few months. </p><p>However, in 2025 Mr Dixon said Brighton could easily move into top spot as Melbourne's most valuable suburb. </p><p>\"I reckon this year will be a good one,\" he said. </p><p>Rising interest from migrant families from China that initially settled around Glen Waverley and Wheelers Hill, as well as from families in Hawthorn and Kew who were now seeking a more bayside home were behind strong demand early in 2025, Mr Dixon said. </p><p>The CoreLogic figures show Glen Waverley was the wider city of Melbourne's next most concentrated area for housing wealth, with a combined $24.479bn value across its almost 16,500 homes. </p><p>Kew at $21.673bn and Mt Waverley at $21.106bn rounded out the city's top five, with Toorak's comparatively smaller number of homes earning the suburb seventh place across the metropolitan area - despite individual properties there thought to be worth more than $100m.</p><p>Mr Lawless said the country's most valuable suburbs usually had a combination of high property price points and large numbers of dwellings, with areas that have had substantial apartment development in the past two decades also well represented.</p><p>\"There is a real concentration of value in our capitals,\" he said. </p><p>\"This points to where people want to live and where they believe they can get a high standard of living.\"</p><p>On the other side of the divide, rural areas a long way from the coast and with a combination of limited local amenities and sparse housing density were unsurprisingly home to less valuable housing markets. </p><p>Pentland Hills near Bacchus Marsh was regarded as metropolitan Melbourne's least valuable pocket, with a combined housing value of just $89.9m, the 18th lowest number of any capital city suburb nationwide.</p><p>The CoreLogic research estimated values based on sales in each area as well as numbers of homes, with those featuring fewer than 100 dwellings excluded.</p><p>MELBOURNE'S MOST VALUABLE SUBURBS</p><p>Melbourne: $25,937,271,730 (49,779 homes)</p><p>Brighton: $25,836,620,501 (10,923 homes)</p><p>Glen Waverley: $24,478,644,582 (16,496 homes)</p><p>Kew: $21,672,768,516 (11,446 homes)</p><p>Mount Waverley: $21,106,203,784 (14,141 homes)</p><p>Glen Iris: $19,395,296,319 (11,857 homes)</p><p>Toorak: $19,386,744,801 (7,724 homes)</p><p>Camberwell: $18,016,772,880 (9,197 homes)</p><p>Reservoir: $17,679,775,794 (22,653 homes)</p><p>South Yarra: $17,094,811,724 (19,332 homes)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Estimated values include all houses, apartments, units and townhouses in suburb</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Source: CoreLogic</emphasis></p><p>Sign up to the Herald Sun Weekly Real Estate Update.

But that outcome is by no means the end to hostilities between the media scions.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">James Murdoch has lobbed a bomb at his father and brother, and is preparing to do worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's the message Antipodean watchers of the Murdoch family are taking from the weekend's unprecedented revelations into the inner workings of the Australian-born but now global media dynasty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prompting the intrigue are two stunning features on the family, delivered within hours of each other and each centred on Rupert Murdoch's audacious and so-far unsuccessful attempt to write his relatively liberal-minded children Elisabeth, James and Prudence MacLeod out of their eventual majority control of the family trust, to the advantage of favoured son and would-be successor Lachlan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One story is a blow-by-blow of 3000 pages of legal transcripts leaked to the New York Times, a fascinating if relatively neutral account of previously secret affairs. The other - a largely sympathetic profile of \"troublesome beneficiary\" James Murdoch in The Atlantic - is more pointed and personal.</p><p>But both, beneath the splashy melodrama and differences of style, make a fundamentally legal point. The attempt to alter the family trust has failed, and even upon appeal, will probably not succeed. Things are back in their holding pattern. Only now, that pattern is untenable.</p><p>Everyone hates Lachlan and is barely talking to Rupert.</p><p>The solution?</p><p>A buy-out of the troublesome siblings, on more agreeable terms than the 60 per cent of market value they'd been offered. Call it a veiled threat. As Prue, Liz and James told Times: \"We are refraining from comment at this moment, because most of the litigation is still under seal.\" Key words: at this moment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/why-the-murdoch-trust-battle-is-about-more-than-money-20240919-p5kbw1\">Of course, this is nothing less than a family divorce, and so motivations aren't singular</url>. In laying out his side of decades of family tensions in The Atlantic, James gives every appearance of seeking a moral vindication.</p><p>His father, he told McKay Coppins over months of interviews, was \"a misogynist\" who never considered his daughters as potential successors. An uncaring patriarch who shows no interest in his grandchildren, and who organises sham family counselling retreats with the sole aim of isolating and controlling his troublesome son. And a \"twisted\" and inscrutable opponent, at one point in a deposition texting an attorney who called James and his sisters \"white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies\" with suggestions on where to push his son next.</p><p>There's no denying the Murdoch children have all done well out of the family business. Aside from a lifetime of assured privilege and relevance, each was paid $US2.1 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2019 for selling their stake of the company's entertainment assets to Disney. Further, the Sun King does not appear misguided about his troublesome son's antipathy for News Corp's editorial positioning.</p><p>Asked by Coppins what changes they want to see in the family's outlets, James' wife Kathryn makes a telling remark about Fox News. \"It doesn't have a clear purpose in the ecosystem any more,\" she says.</p><p>Reading that, on Monday, led Sydney broker and long-time Lachlan backer Angus Aitken to quip his thanks that neither James nor Kathryn have anything to do with the business. \"It is pretty obvious that if James did get his way ... it would have ended up like MSNBC and CNN: financially distressed with declining ratings, revenues and relevance,\" he said.</p><p>The profile is, in a sense, a rebuttal to such views, widely expressed in Australia and in the closed Nevada trial (where James was grilled on his business achievements). The younger Murdoch son is depicted as a suave, sophisticated bureaucrat who turned a loss-making Asian satellite subsidiary around and knew how to drive cultural and financial change within legacy businesses. A polymath who studied film animation and founded a Harvard Lampoon comic strip (Albrecht the Atypical Hun), before founding a successful record label. Sure, he ended up selling Rawkus Records to daddy. But that wasn't a favour, the piece argues. More a sign of Rupert's endless appetite for control.</p><p>In the Times piece, it is the Murdoch women who dominate. Liz and Prue are close, frequently sharing blow-by-blow, emoji-laden messages of their fraught contact with their father and brothers.</p><p>Prue, the daughter from Rupert's first marriage to Patricia Booker, even advises Rupert on how to reach out to James, suggesting he talk to him about missing his grandchildren, rather than going heavy on the manoeuvring (\"I know. Not totally stupid,\" Rupert replies).</p><p>When Rupert later attempted to enlist his daughters' support in disenfranchising them of their birthright, they were stunned.</p><p>According to trial transcripts, Prue called her father and warned him about treating her and Liz like \"assistants\". \"You already lost one son. And you could well lose two daughters over this,\" she tells him.</p><p>Liz, meanwhile, urged her father to find another solution, and told him he was misunderstanding James, to which Rupert responded that she'd been lobbied by James and \"you're going to bend to his will\".</p><p>\"Do you think I'm a f---ing moron,\" she replied.</p><p>She also tried appealing to Lachlan, telling him she'd always been his biggest supporter and that the trust changes were a \"massive gut punch\". Lachlan was unsympathetic. \"Today is about dad's wishes and confirming all of our support for him and for his wishes. It shouldn't be difficult or controversial,\" he texted back.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/rupert-murdoch-hosts-secret-wedding-as-he-eyes-trip-home-20240602-p5jilw\">When Murdoch married his fifth wife, Elena Zhukova</url>, last year, Liz and Prue sent their apologies. James wasn't invited.</p><p>Anna Murdoch - Rupert's second wife and the mother of Liz, Lachlan and James - also made an appearance in the trial. It is to her that Rupert tellingly tied the future of conservatism in the English-speaking world to the ascension of his oldest son. \"Fox and our papers are the only faintly conservative voices against the monolithic liberal media,\" he wrote in an email.</p><p>Anna didn't disagree, pushing her ex-husband to \"get things sorted out soon\". \"Lachlan is the best to run the business ... James is very bright and articulate - but time and again showed poor judgment.\"</p><p>She also lashed James and Kathryn for existing in \"their own circle of like-minded woke friends\", while lauding Fox for playing \"a huge and important role in calling out the idiocies that surround us\". \"I sometimes fear that America is doomed because of the wrongheadedness of the cultural elites.\"</p><p>But for all their ideological alignment, the two do not seem to share personal confidences. Asked on the stand, Rupert admits himself unaware Anna has been diagnosed with a form of dementia.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800/t_resize_width/q_86%2Cf_auto/8f53d6e57699d766566500546b014ba2f7076a99\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Louie Douvis</p><p>A character in both pieces is Lachlan Murdoch's right-hand-woman (and Australia Post chairwoman) Siobhan McKenna, who was tasked with finding a solution to a post-Rupert world in which Lachlan is outmanoeuvred by his siblings. The trust structure Rupert went to court to try to force through? It's her plan, as engineered by the lawyers at a Nevada estate law firm.</p><p>She's also mentioned in The Atlantic's article, in a section riffing on the impact of reports that Lachlan \"gets fired the day Rupert dies\", vividly made in Paddy Manning's unauthorised biography of the oldest Murdoch son. Lachlan told Rupert that James was responsible for the narrative. But The Atlantic casts scepticism on this. Citing legal disclosures, it states that McKenna spent more than 14 hours anonymously briefing Manning.</p><p>The Atlantic's story also makes much of James' shock and hurt at discovering how his father and brother have leaked to the press against him. But it would be naive to think he does not do the same.

wildfire was emotional for a Stanthorpe volunteer firefighter. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hugh Strong had just celebrated his one year wedding anniversary when he was deployed to a tiny mining town in northwestern Alberta. </p><p>Wanting to return the favour to the many Canadian firefighters who travelled to Australia in 2019, Mr Strong courageously applied to join a Queensland Fire Department international contingent.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/stanthorpe/stanthorpe-mans-13000km-journey-to-brave-international-bushfires-in-canada/news-story/ed8aa84385387fda32d42d8476a40296\">His first officer James Massey OAM told Stanthorpe Border Post in August the crew at Sugarloaf Rural Fire Brigade were incredibly proud of Mr Strong.</url></p><p>Having spent time on the front line during the 2019 black summer bushfires, Mr Strong is no stranger to raging fires. </p><p>Mr Strong said the eye-opening experience reminded him why it's important to never rush into a situation. </p><p>\"Taking an extra couple of seconds to stop and look to find the best way forward is incredibly important,\" he said. </p><p>While Canadian wildfires aren't quite as fast moving as Australian bushfires, they are notorious for burning as deep as four feet below ground without anyone knowing, Mr Strong said. </p><p>As a crew leader Mr Strong wasn't only responsible for the physical welfare of his team, but managing their mental fatigue of people  thousands of kilometres away from home.</p><p>\"You had to keep an eye out for signals if everything is okay out here and also if things were going on at home,\" he said. </p><p>Mr Strong said the significant time difference meant it was often difficult to keep in regular contact with his loved ones. </p><p>\"It was tough on my wife but we made the effort to connect,\" he said. </p><p>Recognised for efforts within his own crew and in helping others, Mr Strong received multiple 'challenge coins' from senior members of Canadian fire crews, as well as one of his own. </p><p>\"It was a truly exceptional experience to work as a team leader and having your peers recognising you and your value,\" he said. </p><p>\"Because you don't always know that you're doing a good job until someone tells you.\" </p><p>Mr Strong said there was only one other thing he was excited for apart from seeing his family upon his return. </p><p>\"After 40 days we just wanted to get home and have a good Australian coffee, the coffee in Canada is incredibly weak (in comparison),\" he said. </p><p>Mr Strong encouraged other Southern Downs volunteer firefighters to consider putting their hands up to join in on the life-changing, rewarding experience. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?We hope by filling this gap, it will help unlock options for better ecosystem management and help sustain the existing balance of our environment.?<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Google sought to address the gap, he said, by partnering with Muon Space and the Environmental Defense Fund to create infra-red sensors that could detect smaller fires and to design a group of satellites to cover the globe.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?When we designed the satellite constellation and we were looking at its capabilities, certainly the bushfires in Australia were part of the design requirements,? he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?We are going to make this data as broadly available as possible.?<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Artificial intelligence and machine-learning software, Mr Van Arsdale said, would be used to compare images to identify fires as small as five square metres.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Earth Fire Alliance executive director Brian Collins said the project?s first satellite would be launched in March next year but comprehensive data may not be available until more satellites were brought online.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?It will be collecting (data) during the 2025 season but it?s one satellite, not a full constellation, and it will be learning and sharing the data with our Australian early adopters,? he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?Operationally, our biggest impact to Australia will be in the 2026 time-frame when we launch our next three operational satellites.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The FireSat project also received assistance from Andrew and Nicola Forrest?s philanthropic Mindaroo Foundation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 CSIRO Data61 senior principal research scientist Mahesh Prakash said gaining access to more information about the location of bushfires would not only assist firefighters but could help scientists predict where fires would break out.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Providing real-time, high-resolution inputs to such model predictions could assist firefighters in their decision-making processes and make a difference in how wildfires are managed,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Any improvements to wildfire detection could aid in enhancing model predictions.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Google previously introduced bushfire warnings to its Maps application in the US in 2020, and to Australia in December 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D03-SXK1-DYG0-9003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><timeReceived>3:30 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.
