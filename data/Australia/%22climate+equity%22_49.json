Pauchet</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My climate anxiety was abruptly born at the age of 10 in 2013, as a blaze of 200-metre flames swept through my hometown of Dunalley, in Tasmania.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I clearly remember waking up at 2.00am to throw up as my stomach finally gave into the butterflies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was quaking with nerves. Although the middle of the night, the sky was lit by the orange, red and white glow of the surrounding farmlands as I watched my community's livelihoods swallowed by the same fiery beast that would later consume my dreams.</p><p>My experience was not abnormal. For too many young Australians, encounters with catastrophic climate-fuelled disasters have become an unnaturally common occurrence.</p><p>Just this summer, the country spent months preparing for what was expected to be the most extreme fire season on record, only to be met with storms, cyclones, and floods.</p><p>I realised the extent to which these experiences have become normal in my teens, as groups of friends casually swapped anecdotes of where they were that summer, - whether they got evacuated, how cold their toes got sitting in the ocean as they waited for help, or simply arguing over which one was Black Friday. Or was that Ash Saturday?</p><p>In the end we all agreed: why does it matter, when every summer seems to be black and covered with ash?</p><p>A lingering fear remained, quickly rearing its ugly head as one of us caught a whiff of smoke or another watched a fresh torrential downpour with frightened apprehension.</p><p>It wasn't until I turned 20 that I finally had a label for these feeling: climate anxiety. It's the feeling of fear and dread when considering the state of the environmental world in both the present and the future.</p><p>The future. That's what gets me every time.</p><p>The experience of being asked to pack only your most treasured belongings in anticipation of the worst shares dark symmetry with our generation's views of the future.</p><p>Which hopes and dreams are most important to save? And what, regardless of how much we desire to take it with us, must we be forced to leave behind?</p><p>For many, we feel the weight of a century's worth of environmental neglect on our shoulders, and on the shoulders of the generations we bring into the future. We feel a desperate need to act through self-sacrifice to cling to the bright future we were always promised.</p><p>In a country boastful of freedom, choice and chasing dreams, we feel the neglectful boundaries set by those before us, squeezing at the necks of what we thought was possible. Jobs. Travel. Homes. Children. All of which are in arm's reach, yet we question whether pursuing these is \"right\", and whether desiring a family is not just the best decision for us, but the responsible decision for the planet.</p><p>This is what terrifies me the most.</p><p>At 10, I watched my world turn to ash, and now in my twenties, at an age where my focus should be the joy of the present, I continue to watch the world burn into the future.</p><p>Bringing children into a life where we spend more time creating bushfire evacuation plans and listening to heatwave warnings than enjoying the summer's breeze is not normal, yet we continue to treat it as such.</p><p>Children deserve to look at the world with hope in their eyes and opportunities at their fingertips, not wondering whether their houses will survive the summer or if their mere existence is more of a burden to the natural world than a blessing.</p><p>I don't just feel anxiety. I feel anger, disbelief, loss, and fear as I mourn for my future and the future of the children I was promised I could have.</p><p>But my climate anxiety isn't a solo venture, nor should it be a burden to bear alone. Today, a Senate committee is due to hand down their recommendation on the Climate Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity) Bill, a bill supported by nearly 400 submissions many of them written by young people, including myself.</p><p>Co-authored by another young person, Dante Casanova, and Save the Children Australia, our submission pleads with our government to consider their actions beyond their elected term, to view their privileged time in Parliament as an opportunity to build the future that their generation deserves.</p><p>That we, their children, deserve.

Although the middle of the night, the sky was lit by the orange, red and white glow of the surrounding farmlands as I watched my community's livelihoods swallowed by the same fiery beast that would later consume my dreams.</p><p>My experience was not abnormal. For too many young Australians, encounters with catastrophic climate-fuelled disasters have become an unnaturally common occurrence.</p><p>Just this summer, the country spent months preparing for what was expected to be the most extreme fire season on record, only to be met with storms, cyclones, and floods.</p><p>I realised the extent to which these experiences have become normal in my teens, as groups of friends casually swapped anecdotes of where they were that summer, - whether they got evacuated, how cold their toes got sitting in the ocean as they waited for help, or simply arguing over which one was Black Friday. Or was that Ash Saturday?</p><p>In the end we all agreed: why does it matter, when every summer seems to be black and covered with ash?</p><p>A lingering fear remained, quickly rearing its ugly head as one of us caught a whiff of smoke or another watched a fresh torrential downpour with frightened apprehension.</p><p>It wasn't until I turned 20 that I finally had a label for these feeling: climate anxiety. It's the feeling of fear and dread when considering the state of the environmental world in both the present and the future.</p><p>The future.

And what, regardless of how much we desire to take it with us, must we be forced to leave behind?</p><p>For many, we feel the weight of a century's worth of environmental neglect on our shoulders, and on the shoulders of the generations we bring into the future. We feel a desperate need to act through self-sacrifice to cling to the bright future we were always promised.</p><p>In a country boastful of freedom, choice and chasing dreams, we feel the neglectful boundaries set by those before us, squeezing at the necks of what we thought was possible. Jobs. Travel. Homes. Children. All of which are in arm's reach, yet we question whether pursuing these is \"right\", and whether desiring a family is not just the best decision for us, but the responsible decision for the planet.</p><p>This is what terrifies me the most.</p><p>At 10, I watched my world turn to ash, and now in my twenties, at an age where my focus should be the joy of the present, I continue to watch the world burn into the future.</p><p>Bringing children into a life where we spend more time creating bushfire evacuation plans and listening to heatwave warnings than enjoying the summer's breeze is not normal, yet we continue to treat it as such.</p><p>Children deserve to look at the world with hope in their eyes and opportunities at their fingertips, not wondering whether their houses will survive the summer or if their mere existence is more of a burden to the natural world than a blessing.</p><p>I don't just feel anxiety. I feel anger, disbelief, loss, and fear as I mourn for my future and the future of the children I was promised I could have.</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p>As politics blurs into entertainment, the loudest mouths draw the most eyeballs It's time to go nuclear on the Coalition's stupidity A female PM within 20 years?

I've sat on a hill overlooking Takayna and had the plans explained - this was years ago after deforestation was already well in progress. If there was a God, I would ask her to bless Bob Brown and the Bob Brown Foundation and others for working so hard and under such intense opposition from mining and forestry interests to keep what's left of our endangered wilderness - its survival is necessary for our world.</p><p>Irene Wheatley, Bethania (Qld)</p><p>Having spent days wandering through the Takayna wilderness, I agree with Brooks.

The tree could not be chopped down as it was under the protection of the fairies and to chop it down would end in disaster. The forest in Tasmania, that a foreign-owned mining company wants to turn into a tailings dam, should be placed under the protection of Brooks' fairies. Hopefully, Plibersek is now aware of the fairy curse. If not, she might find homeless fairies living at the bottom of her garden to remind her, every day, of a poor decision.</p><p>Patrick St George, Goulburn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7u4x1t7j3wlr5y7o7wq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BB7-D4F1-F0J6-J01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.   Ryan has become something of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7346107303994625281\">TikTok</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7332353223652543745\">star</url> due to her proposals, and her petition <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moniqueryan.com.au/monique_ryan_and_zoe_daniel_to_deliver_record_80_000_signature_hecs_debt_petition_to_minister\">gained 80,000 signatures</url> in just six days. She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest. Their electorates house many young students, with Kooyong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/24/election-political-youthquake-hits-inner-cities/\">boasting</url> the highest number of voters under 24 in Victoria (and not far off nationwide). Ryan and Daniel can\u2019t win reelection without them, and young people have been increasingly vocal online about these issues after the 2022-23 financial year saw debts rise substantially with inflation, providing clear incentives for opportunistic leaders.  Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>. This would ensure their interests are directly represented, rather than mediated through committees of government-appointed prefects. It\u2019d give them real power \u2014 though, as some cynics <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1036114042000238573\">argue</url>, perhaps the lack of real power is part of why politicians like \u201cyouth consultation\u201d in the first place.  If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet? How can government processes, especially in an ageing society, be calibrated to meaningfully account for the interests of the young and future generations?  Thomas Walker, CEO of the youth-led think tank Think Forward, has a few ideas. He commends the government\u2019s strategy, and is impressed by Aly\u2019s engagement with current advisory group participants. But he hopes her strategy is a first step, followed by \u201ca broader effort to embed intergenerational thinking into policymaking through legal mechanisms with teeth\u201d.  He points to Wales\u2019 \"future generations commissioner\", a product of the country\u2019s 2015 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wellbeing of Future Generations Act</emphasis>. This legislation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/\">imposes</url> a legal responsibility on government agencies to govern with future generations in mind, by adhering to a list of \u201csustainable development\u201d principles. It has already prompted various progressive changes, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/economic-growth/regional-development/2023/12/wales-politics-world\">cancellation</url> of most major road projects and reinvestment of the proceeds in public transport projects.  Walker is also a fan of Senator David Pocock\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/DutyofCareBill\">Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity Bill</url>, which a Senate committee is due to report on this week. If passed in its current form, it would require governments to consider the impact of climate harm on young people and future generations in their decision-making, and to not make decisions that pose a material risk of harm to their health and well-being.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good-faith effort to embed the rights of young and future generations into the government decision-making process,\u201d says Walker. \u201cHowever, the government's refusal to support the legislation perhaps provides a more realistic view of how far they are willing to go\u201d.  Aly certainly seems a passionate advocate for young people. But when representing their views to cabinet, the question remains how often her colleagues move beyond listening and act.  What more should the government be doing to consider the rights of future generations? Should we consider lowering the voting age to 16?

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.   Ryan has become something of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7346107303994625281\">TikTok</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7332353223652543745\">star</url> due to her proposals, and her petition <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moniqueryan.com.au/monique_ryan_and_zoe_daniel_to_deliver_record_80_000_signature_hecs_debt_petition_to_minister\">gained 80,000 signatures</url> in just six days. She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest. Their electorates house many young students, with Kooyong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/24/election-political-youthquake-hits-inner-cities/\">boasting</url> the highest number of voters under 24 in Victoria (and not far off nationwide). Ryan and Daniel can\u2019t win reelection without them, and young people have been increasingly vocal online about these issues after the 2022-23 financial year saw debts rise substantially with inflation, providing clear incentives for opportunistic leaders.  Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>. This would ensure their interests are directly represented, rather than mediated through committees of government-appointed prefects. It\u2019d give them real power \u2014 though, as some cynics <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1036114042000238573\">argue</url>, perhaps the lack of real power is part of why politicians like \u201cyouth consultation\u201d in the first place.  If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet? How can government processes, especially in an ageing society, be calibrated to meaningfully account for the interests of the young and future generations?  Thomas Walker, CEO of the youth-led think tank Think Forward, has a few ideas. He commends the government\u2019s strategy, and is impressed by Aly\u2019s engagement with current advisory group participants. But he hopes her strategy is a first step, followed by \u201ca broader effort to embed intergenerational thinking into policymaking through legal mechanisms with teeth\u201d.  He points to Wales\u2019 \"future generations commissioner\", a product of the country\u2019s 2015 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wellbeing of Future Generations Act</emphasis>. This legislation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/\">imposes</url> a legal responsibility on government agencies to govern with future generations in mind, by adhering to a list of \u201csustainable development\u201d principles. It has already prompted various progressive changes, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/economic-growth/regional-development/2023/12/wales-politics-world\">cancellation</url> of most major road projects and reinvestment of the proceeds in public transport projects.  Walker is also a fan of Senator David Pocock\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/DutyofCareBill\">Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity Bill</url>, which a Senate committee is due to report on this week. If passed in its current form, it would require governments to consider the impact of climate harm on young people and future generations in their decision-making, and to not make decisions that pose a material risk of harm to their health and well-being.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good-faith effort to embed the rights of young and future generations into the government decision-making process,\u201d says Walker. \u201cHowever, the government's refusal to support the legislation perhaps provides a more realistic view of how far they are willing to go\u201d.  Aly certainly seems a passionate advocate for young people. But when representing their views to cabinet, the question remains how often her colleagues move beyond listening and act.  What more should the government be doing to consider the rights of future generations? Should we consider lowering the voting age to 16?

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.   Ryan has become something of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7346107303994625281\">TikTok</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7332353223652543745\">star</url> due to her proposals, and her petition <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moniqueryan.com.au/monique_ryan_and_zoe_daniel_to_deliver_record_80_000_signature_hecs_debt_petition_to_minister\">gained 80,000 signatures</url> in just six days. She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest. Their electorates house many young students, with Kooyong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/24/election-political-youthquake-hits-inner-cities/\">boasting</url> the highest number of voters under 24 in Victoria (and not far off nationwide). Ryan and Daniel can\u2019t win reelection without them, and young people have been increasingly vocal online about these issues after the 2022-23 financial year saw debts rise substantially with inflation, providing clear incentives for opportunistic leaders.  Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>.

If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet? How can government processes, especially in an ageing society, be calibrated to meaningfully account for the interests of the young and future generations?  Thomas Walker, CEO of the youth-led think tank Think Forward, has a few ideas. He commends the government\u2019s strategy, and is impressed by Aly\u2019s engagement with current advisory group participants. But he hopes her strategy is a first step, followed by \u201ca broader effort to embed intergenerational thinking into policymaking through legal mechanisms with teeth\u201d.  He points to Wales\u2019 \"future generations commissioner\", a product of the country\u2019s 2015 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wellbeing of Future Generations Act</emphasis>. This legislation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/\">imposes</url> a legal responsibility on government agencies to govern with future generations in mind, by adhering to a list of \u201csustainable development\u201d principles.

What more should the government be doing to consider the rights of future generations? Should we consider lowering the voting age to 16?

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.   Ryan has become something of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7346107303994625281\">TikTok</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mon4kooyong/video/7332353223652543745\">star</url> due to her proposals, and her petition <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moniqueryan.com.au/monique_ryan_and_zoe_daniel_to_deliver_record_80_000_signature_hecs_debt_petition_to_minister\">gained 80,000 signatures</url> in just six days. She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest. Their electorates house many young students, with Kooyong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/24/election-political-youthquake-hits-inner-cities/\">boasting</url> the highest number of voters under 24 in Victoria (and not far off nationwide). Ryan and Daniel can\u2019t win reelection without them, and young people have been increasingly vocal online about these issues after the 2022-23 financial year saw debts rise substantially with inflation, providing clear incentives for opportunistic leaders.  Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>.

If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet? How can government processes, especially in an ageing society, be calibrated to meaningfully account for the interests of the young and future generations?  Thomas Walker, CEO of the youth-led think tank Think Forward, has a few ideas. He commends the government\u2019s strategy, and is impressed by Aly\u2019s engagement with current advisory group participants.

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.

She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest. Their electorates house many young students, with Kooyong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/24/election-political-youthquake-hits-inner-cities/\">boasting</url> the highest number of voters under 24 in Victoria (and not far off nationwide). Ryan and Daniel can\u2019t win reelection without them, and young people have been increasingly vocal online about these issues after the 2022-23 financial year saw debts rise substantially with inflation, providing clear incentives for opportunistic leaders.  Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>.

If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet? How can government processes, especially in an ageing society, be calibrated to meaningfully account for the interests of the young and future generations?  Thomas Walker, CEO of the youth-led think tank Think Forward, has a few ideas. He commends the government\u2019s strategy, and is impressed by Aly\u2019s engagement with current advisory group participants.

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.

She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest.

Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>.

If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet?

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.

It didn't garner much media coverage, perhaps because it didn\u2019t contain many surprising components. It mostly just locks in existing consultation mechanisms, such as the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Groups, through which selected young people advise government departments. Added to this was the National Youth Forum, an annual talkfest, the first of which was held last Wednesday in Canberra with 110 young people aged 14-25 from across the country. The whole strategy is guided by a steering group of 15 more young people.  The government is keen to demonstrate it is listening to young people -- more than 4,600 of them for this report. But what exactly all that listening amounts to is vague, beyond yet more listening.  This is not to say there is no point in consulting with specific groups of young people. In the areas of health, education and social services, and especially trauma-laden topics such as domestic violence and suicide, young people are frequently impacted in particular, harmful ways. Gathering data on their experiences \u2014 and, importantly, their interactions with government agencies \u2014 helps improve government policies and agency processes.  But on broader political issues important to young people, such as housing and climate change, it\u2019s unclear whether such \u201cyouth consultation\u201d achieves anything that traditional political processes cannot.  What did Minister for Climate Change Chris Bowen, for instance, learn from the government\u2019s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28 that wasn\u2019t evident from the thousands of students who have walked out of class multiple times to protest the slow pace of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction?  On such thorny intergenerational issues, the problem is not so much a lack of information or understanding from ministers, but their hedging against countervailing pressures from vested interests and older generations content with the status quo. What will move the needle is not another tick-a-box forum, but concrete electoral pressure that politicians can\u2019t ignore.  Exhibit A: teal MPs Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel are currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/teals-back-cutting-hecs-indexation-20240320-p5fdty\">pushing</url> for HECS indexation changes. Based on a recommendation by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/university-accord-jason-clare-labor-students-cost-of-living/\">Universities Accord</url>, they want debts indexed by either the consumer price index or wage price index \u2014 whichever is lower. They also want indexation to be calculated at the end of the financial year so that money paid off in that year isn\u2019t included.

She and Ryan will present it to Education Minister Jason Clare in the coming days.  I don\u2019t doubt Ryan and Daniel sincerely support such proposals, but their advocacy is undergirded by self-interest.

Their electorates house many young students, with Kooyong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/24/election-political-youthquake-hits-inner-cities/\">boasting</url> the highest number of voters under 24 in Victoria (and not far off nationwide). Ryan and Daniel can\u2019t win reelection without them, and young people have been increasingly vocal online about these issues after the 2022-23 financial year saw debts rise substantially with inflation, providing clear incentives for opportunistic leaders.  Fair enough, but what about the young people who can\u2019t vote yet? Well, perhaps we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-16-australians-can-drive-work-and-apply-for-the-army-so-why-cant-they-vote-177370\">enfranchise more of them</url>. This would ensure their interests are directly represented, rather than mediated through committees of government-appointed prefects. It\u2019d give them real power \u2014 though, as some cynics <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1036114042000238573\">argue</url>, perhaps the lack of real power is part of why politicians like \u201cyouth consultation\u201d in the first place.  If the state can jail a 16-year-old, shouldn\u2019t they at least get to vote on the laws that send them there?  But what about kids below the voting age, you might ask? Indeed, what about children who haven\u2019t even been born yet? How can government processes, especially in an ageing society, be calibrated to meaningfully account for the interests of the young and future generations?  Thomas Walker, CEO of the youth-led think tank Think Forward, has a few ideas. He commends the government\u2019s strategy, and is impressed by Aly\u2019s engagement with current advisory group participants. But he hopes her strategy is a first step, followed by \u201ca broader effort to embed intergenerational thinking into policymaking through legal mechanisms with teeth\u201d.  He points to Wales\u2019 \"future generations commissioner\", a product of the country\u2019s 2015 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wellbeing of Future Generations Act</emphasis>. This legislation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/\">imposes</url> a legal responsibility on government agencies to govern with future generations in mind, by adhering to a list of \u201csustainable development\u201d principles. It has already prompted various progressive changes, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/economic-growth/regional-development/2023/12/wales-politics-world\">cancellation</url> of most major road projects and reinvestment of the proceeds in public transport projects.  Walker is also a fan of Senator David Pocock\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/DutyofCareBill\">Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity Bill</url>, which a Senate committee is due to report on this week. If passed in its current form, it would require governments to consider the impact of climate harm on young people and future generations in their decision-making, and to not make decisions that pose a material risk of harm to their health and well-being.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good-faith effort to embed the rights of young and future generations into the government decision-making process,\u201d says Walker. \u201cHowever, the government's refusal to support the legislation perhaps provides a more realistic view of how far they are willing to go\u201d.  Aly certainly seems a passionate advocate for young people. But when representing their views to cabinet, the question remains how often her colleagues move beyond listening and act.  What more should the government be doing to consider the rights of future generations? Should we consider lowering the voting age to 16?

There have been a couple of such stories in the past week. One was in a small township in Queensland where the local council elected to provide a gift of ham to every resident. The second was how the mayor of the City of Kingston fosters children who may not otherwise share in the goodwill of Christmas (\"The mayor fostering Christmas spirit\", 19/12).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are no doubt many people who do similar acts but go unnoticed by those outside of their community. They may not share in any awards that are handed out by various government authorities, and do not seek them, but all of us should be thankful such acts of goodwill and kindness exists, and perhaps in a way spur all of us to consider what we can do should the opportunity arise. Bruce MacKenzie, South Kingsville</p><p>Things are getting better</p><p>I would've agreed with your correspondent about humankind's self-destruction (\"The road to ruin\", Letters, 19/12), until I discovered evidence that today, anyone's chances of being killed violently are infinitesimally small compared with the long past, and the trend is continuing, despite the wars, big and small. That's consistent with whoever noticed that over the long arc of human history, things do get better - even though it's hard to see. We should keep hoping and working towards good outcomes. The alternative is despair and inaction. Peter Greig, Colac</p><p>Dangers ignored</p><p>I fear your correspondent may be correct: there is little likelihood that humanity will make the changes necessary for our children and grandchildren to inherit a sustainable, liveable environment. We have, particularly since the advent of television and its advertisers' depictions of \"better lifestyles\", embraced pleasure and convenience ahead of maintaining a sustainable environment. While at first we did this in ignorance of the risks, in recent decades we have clung to these sybaritic priorities in full knowledge of the dangers. We still have time to stem this environmental damage, but must change our priorities. One immediate step will be to support David Pocock's Climate Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity) Bill, which seeks to make the environmental interests of future generations of paramount importance in all federal government decision-making. Chris Young, Surrey Hills</p><p>Human help</p><p>It is extraordinary for your correspondent to say that the survival of the Earth's complex ecosystem \"doesn't need mankind\". Changes can occur in nature that are not always good for the planet, and such things as managed logging and farming and fishing and mining can actually contribute to its wellbeing. Peter Drum, Coburg</p><p>The end of the world</p><p>Recent correspondence highlights the inability of humans to exist within the Earth's ecosystem. The quote \"it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end to capitalism\" provides a useful insight. Peter Thomas, Pascoe Vale</p><p>Depending on nature</p><p>Your correspondent laments that Mother Nature lost the COP28 Climate Change Conference vote (And Another Thing, 19/12). After 14 billion years of evolution, the natural world never loses. Only anthropological arrogance and magical thinking believes that nature will just keep on giving what is needed to sustain life despite the unsustainable environmental damage that is being done to it.

If the then 12-year-old had not been filled with anxiety \u2014 and a need to act \u2014 as she connected climate change with the crippling heatwaves endured by her relatives in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's been heaps of moments where I've kind of just wished that I could be a teenager,\" Ms Sharma, now 19, <url normalizedValue=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/australian-story\">tells Australian Story</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Because once you enter the world of environmental activism, you start to look at the world in a completely different way.\"</p><p>Ms Sharma\u00a0didn't just enter the world of activism, she burst into it. At 14, she organised <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-20/school-strike-for-climate-draws-thousands-to-australian-rallies/11531612\">school climate strikes in her hometown of Melbourne</url>; by 16, she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-27/climate-class-action-teenagers-vickery-coal-mine-legal-precedent/100169398\">sued the then-federal environment minister Sussan Ley in a climate change-related Federal Court case</url>.</p><p>She's stood, daunted, in courtrooms where \"everyone seemed so tall \u2026 so professional \u2026 so well-dressed\". She's watched via video link from her year 11 economics class as her landmark win against Ms Ley was handed down, the legal jargon so foreign she wasn't sure if it was a win or not.</p><p>She's held hands with her young friends, devastated, as the victory was overturned eight months later.</p><p>She's been called naive, trolled on social media, racially vilified, patronised.</p><p>But\u00a0Ms Sharma believes the world, her future, is on the brink of a climate disaster and it's her right \u2013 duty even \u2013 to try to pull it back. So, while it would be \"quite nice\" to be a normal teenager focusing \"on the next exam \u2026 or the next party and [not] have that sense of overwhelming worry about the world\", Ms Sharma's extracurricular activities are a tad unusual.</p><p>First, she tried the courts. Now, she's focused on the government, marshalling a band of like-minded young people, lawyers and politicians to lobby federal parliamentarians for legislative change.</p><p>Their goal? To have laws enacted that would compel politicians to consider their duty of care to the health and well-being of future generations when considering fossil fuel projects.</p><p>\"Ultimately, it's young people who stand to bear the brunt of climate change,\" she says. \"And if our interests aren't considered, then we can't be confident that we'll have the ability to enjoy what the world can offer us in the same way that generations before us did.\"</p><p>It's an ambitious piece of legislation \u2013 and controversial. At a Senate hearing into the proposed bill last month, Liberal senator Hollie Hughes voiced the umbrage taken by politicians on both sides of parliament at the idea that they pass laws without considering future generations.</p><p>\"This is absolutely insane and offensive to me that we're going to legislate a thought process as we put policy in place,\" Senator Hughes said. \"A lot of us are parents, we all do consider the future.\"</p><p>Getting the bill through, even with alterations, is going to be tough, but\u00a0Ms Sharma is adamant that if it fails, younger generations will know their place \u2013 secondary to fossil fuel companies wanting to \"extract and exploit and export\".</p><h>The dorm room HQ</h><p>The lobbying headquarters helping to drive this landmark legislative change is not filled with bound volumes of case law or old men in suits.</p><p>It's not even an office but a dormitory, with happy snaps on the wall and a tiny teddy bear on the bed. It's here, in Anjali's dorm room at Canberra's Australian National University, that her grassroots team of four young women meet to discuss strategy and talking points.</p><p>\"None of us have ever participated in parliamentary legislation drafting before,\" says Ms Sharma, now a second-year law student. \"It's a massive learning curve.\"</p><p>They do have help. Some say too much help \u2014 that these earnest young women are being used as pawns for the advancement of others' political or financial aims.</p><p>Ms Sharma\u00a0can rattle off the criticisms: \"They're being controlled by the lawyers, by their parents, by the renewable energy companies.\"</p><p>She maintains the genesis of the Climate Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity) Bill 2023 was the talks she had with her legal team after the successful case against Ms Ley was overturned on appeal in March 2022.</p><p>Devastated, they discussed the positives.</p><p>Central to the original win was the finding that Ms Ley, in considering the approval of a specific coalmine expansion, had a duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change.</p><p>In overturning the decision, two of the three appeal court judges did not explicitly find there was no duty of care \u2013 rather, that it was for the parliament to impose, not the courts. The court also did not reject the lower court's findings that climate change was a risk to future generations.</p><h>'Far-fetched and fanciful': Will the bill pass?</h><p>So, the legal team and\u00a0Ms Sharma switched focus to parliament and the idea of formulating legislation to impose a duty of care. At first, she says, even they considered it a \"far-fetched, fanciful possibility\".</p><p>But in the break between finishing year 12 and starting uni, she threw herself into research and met with environmental lawyers and policy experts, building up the case for a bill and how it could operate.</p><p>With that in hand, she canvassed several politicians for their support. Senator David Pocock, the independent senator for the Australian Capital Territory, was receptive and, given her move to Canberra, he became her conduit.</p><p>Senator Pocock says he'd been considering introducing a private senator's bill on climate and had been keenly watching Ms Sharma's court battles. \"We started to talk to her and \u2026 it seemed like a good fit,\" he says.</p><p>He says his office did \"a huge amount of work\" investigating the wording of the bill and where it would fit in existing legislation.</p><p>The result, says Senator Pocock, is a bill that would help safeguard younger generations' climate future by limiting emissions. \"Any fossil fuel project that is going to worsen climate change and the impacts that are felt wouldn't go ahead,\" he tells Australian Story.</p><p>To be expanding the fossil fuel industry in 2024 is \"total madness\", Senator Pocock says. \"When it comes to climate change, we have this really narrow window to act.\"</p><p>That's not the view of all politicians, including the Nationals leader David Littleproud. He rejects the notion advanced by\u00a0Ms Sharma and Senator Pocock that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/am/nats-want-halt-on-regional-renewable-energy-projects/103435660\">Australia has enough existing fossil fuel supply to transition into renewable energy and says \"we've got time\" to pause and plan</url>.</p><p>\"There's not the supply chain of 22,000 solar panels a day that need to be laid, or the 40 wind turbines a month that need to be erected,\" says Mr Littleproud, who has accused the federal government of pursuing a \"reckless race\" to reach 82 per cent renewables in the electricity grid by 2030.</p><p>\"You take away investment confidence in the traditional industries [and] supply goes down, price goes up, and you get a situation where you don't have [sufficient energy supply] in this country at all.

Back then, the 12-year-old felt \"overwhelmingly responsible\" and \"incredibly powerless\".</p><p>\"Every time I turned on a light or left the tap running, it was me who destroyed the world,\" she says.</p><p>\"I've really been able to unpack that over the last few years \u2026 I know now that individual action matters, of course, but it's the action of government, of big polluters, that will have the final say in the way that my future and the future of young people looks.\"</p><p>Ms Sharma\u00a0still feels anxious about her future. But she no longer feels powerless.</p><p>She's felt the passion of young people fighting for climate action, been part of the huge crowds at marches, walked into courtrooms and parliament and had her say. \"The best thing \u2026 has been seeing what young people can do when empowered and given even a smidgen of the tools needed to make a difference,\" she says.</p><p>Ms Sharma\u00a0knows from experience there will be wins and setbacks in the battle for climate action.

The ICC rulings established a set of performance metrics that replaces the anti-consumer formula rate-setting system of the past with a more customer-centered system that, if implemented correctly, will help Illinois consumers secure the equitable, reliable and affordable clean energy future that CEJA envisions.</p><p>Developed out of a workshop process that was unprecedented in transparency and community involvement, these metrics emphasize cost-effective service quality that weary customers have for\u00a0years told us they want from Ameren and ComEd. Under the new system, those utility giants will have to deliver results, or pay a penalty that reduces their profits. We appreciate that the ICC in multiple instances sided with consumer and environmental advocates and approved tougher standards than what the utilities wanted. The metrics require Ameren and ComEd to...\u00a0</p><p>Taken together with approval of a multi-year grid plan called for by CEJA, the performance metrics are part of the landmark energy law's new system where utilities are required to plan their investments with the goal of reducing long-term costs. We thank the ICC for these important rulings, and we thank Environmental Defense Fund and our other partners in the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition for winning the strongest, most pro-consumer metrics possible. While there's a lot of work to be done to enforce the ICC's rulings, these metrics-like CEJA-prioritize climate, equity and consumers, and that's good news for our planet and our pocketbooks.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBTSRW-202301312018CUBICCRulingsUsherInNewEraForIllinoisUtilityCustomers</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBTSRW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YK-P4M1-F0HT-920J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 News Bites Pty Ltd.

In my many years of visiting scores of schools as a researcher I never met one teacher who did not appreciate that phonics is a useful, indeed necessary tool in teaching reading but it is limited and is one aspect of a suite of measures emphasising reading for meaning rather than decoding. Many words cannot be \"sounded out\". A balanced approach takes into consideration children's prior learning, home background, their interests, local contexts, the joy of a story or poem, and more. In ensuring \"kids can read\" comprehension and love of reading to learn are what matter. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ron Sinclair, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Windradyne </emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.192%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1%2C$width_378%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/9080135bfb3f7e97dc3039429e1c4762137730c2\">Link to Image</url></p><p>How many times must we reinvent the wheel? In 1995, my colleagues and I at Macquarie University reviewed the whole language theory behind the Reading Recovery program, used by the Department of Education for at risk readers, and found it was based on a mistaken premise of how children learn to read. We developed a reading program, trialled and evaluated in many schools and based on Success for All, used successfully in the States, which consisted of a structured approach to reading with an emphasis on phonics and structured readers in which pupils could practise the sounds taught in text. I published a text called Beginning Reading which outlined both early literacy research and an exemplary early reading program. I am appalled that after all this time, the reading wars are again being waged. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yola Center, Lane Cove</emphasis></p><p>I want all kids to read well and confidently but also for enjoyment and all their lives. Even though it is claimed to be a myth, the structured literacy approach can lead to \"readicide\" when the teaching of reading is overly dependent on \"readers\" and whole class \"read alouds\", which is boring and monotonous. All students learn to read differently, it's not by osmosis, it's not by whole language alone and it's certainly not via structured literacy ie direct instruction alone. Teachers need to be able to tailor their teaching to suit the needs of the children in their class. They also need more funded learning support staff in every classroom, every school needs a professional teacher librarian and a funded school library. The reading wars will not be over until each is guaranteed. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon McGuinness, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thirroul </emphasis></p><p>I, too, could read before attending school but this is not the case for every child (Letters, February 14). I had the natural ability to break words into chunks of meaning and this was further developed by lessons in phonics. However, a significant number of children struggled in large classes to do the same. Literacy is an important part of life. In my work as a remedial reading teacher I had many interactions with adults and adolescents who have felt shame and experienced limited career opportunities due to their poor levels of literacy. Phonics teaching is a valuable part of the process and success breeds a love of reading. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Linda Page, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Baulkham Hills</emphasis></p><p>I, too, was lucky to be able to read before attending a one-teacher school in 1940 where phonics and drill in basic arithmetic were the morning schedule. My teacher training course covered a suite of reading strategies I used successfully as a primary teacher. However, my years as a special school principal and later a researcher in reading, revealed that a proportion of children find reading quite difficult. They need carefully structured lesson plans which include phonics together with strategies to ensure that there is joy in reading through stirring the imagination. Incidentally, it was comic books, including my favourite Ginger Meggs, which I enjoyed in my pre-school years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trevor Parmenter, Breakfast Point </emphasis></p><p>The problem with relying on phonics to teach literacy is that so often, in English, it doesn't work unless combined with other approaches. The following 19 words use only four vowel letters (a, e, i, o) to express 19 meanings with 14 different vowel sounds: had, hard, head, heed, he'd, herd, heard, hid, hide, hied, hired, hod, hoard, whored, hood, who'd, how'd, hoed, Hoad. Similar example lists abound. Try teaching a child that lot by the simplistic method of \"sounding out the letters\". Result: one confused and discouraged little kid. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Cornelius, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brookvale </emphasis></p><p>The report which shows that student literacy has declined over the past few decades will come as no surprise to long serving experienced teachers who have had to endure the poor directives and policies emanating from educational administrators acting on the advice of ill-informed so-called experts. Just as Ross Gittins rewrites Economic theory in a pragmatic way, teachers need to be able to return to methods which have traditionally worked, rather than follow the directions of these failed experts. Only then will education achieve what it should. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Max Redmayne, Drummoyne</emphasis></p><p>One also has to wonder about the effect of poor reading skills on democracy. Good reading ability enables the development of much better critical thinking. Without good critical thinking how does a person discern deception, disinformation, and misinformation issuing forth from politicians, partisan interests of any form, and - most particularly - media run by oligarchs with a social engineering agenda? <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thompson, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Grenfell </emphasis></p><h>Saving Takayna is Plibersek's duty as environment minister</h><p>Geraldine Brooks makes an impassioned plea, with scientific backup, to Tanya Plibersek regarding a majority Chinese-owned mining company's plans to sink part of Takayna in acidic slush when an alternative disposal method is available (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/plibersek-can-save-this-wonderland-or-give-it-away-with-the-fairies-20240209-p5f3sg.html\">Plibersek can save this wonderland or drown it in acidic- waste</url>\" February 14).</p><p>Is this such a hard ask? I've sat on a hill overlooking Takayna and had the plans explained - this was years ago after deforestation was already well in progress. If there was a God, I would ask her to bless Bob Brown and the Bob Brown Foundation, and others, for working so hard and under such intense opposition from mining and forestry interests, to keep what's left of our endangered wilderness - its survival is necessary for our world.</p><p>Having just read Brooks' article I've written to Plibersek; perhaps many others will do so too and let her know that not only the environmental societies work and care for our future. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Irene Wheatley, Bethania (Qld)</emphasis></p><p>It is no coincidence that the Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity Bill proposed by Senator David Pocock is soon to be debated in the Senate. What better opportunity for our politicians and policymakers to show they care and act in the interests of protecting the people and places we love. Minister Plibersek has the power to make a decision that preserves the forest's magic for all the children of our future. Will she view this as her duty of care? <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joy Nason, Mona Vale</emphasis></p><p>Having spent days wandering through the Takayna wilderness I agree with Brooks.

There are viable alternatives to the dam, but not for this majestic, irreplaceable forest. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jill Stephenson, Woolwich</emphasis></p><p>Come on minister, say \"no\" to the new tailings dam on the west coast of Tasmania.

It had to be diverted because there was a gnarly old hawthorn tree in the path of the planned road, and that was where the fairies lived. The tree could not be chopped down as it was under the protection of the fairies and to chop it down would end in disaster. The forest in Tasmania, that a foreign-owned mining company wants to turn into a tailings dam, should be placed under the protection of Brooks' fairies. Hopefully, Plibersek is now aware of the fairy curse. If not, she might find homeless fairies living at the bottom of her garden to remind her, every day, of a poor decision. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick St George, Goulburn</emphasis></p><p>Ancient trees and native animals, including the wonderful masked owl, will be destroyed if this project is given permission to proceed.

Run roughshod over the existing suburbs, forget the cohesion of existing communities, rubbish heritage listings - a recent columnist even suggested that higher density would bring much needed night-life into existing sleepy suburbs. That, of course, is exactly what a vast number of people in those suburbs desperately do not want. They live where they live to enjoy a quiet, peaceful existence. While the solution to the housing issue is viewed without also seriously addressing other key factors, notably immigration numbers, overly generous negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, and the concentration of employment in the cities, the housing solution will be worse than the problem. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Geoff Wannan, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dawes Point</emphasis></p><h>Asbestos query</h><p>How does asbestos get into mulch which we think of as an organic product (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/asbestos-found-in-multiple-sydney-parks-20240213-p5f4ep.html\">\"Dangerous asbestos found in park as mulch supplier sues\"</url>, February 14)? Some years ago I bought hardwood mulch from a landscape materials supplier. The delivered material was full of small pieces of timber with paint remnants. I rang the provider and was told it was a common practice where timber building materials were shredded and combined with tree waste - so is this how asbestos got into the mulch in Sydney's parks and schools?

My involvement in the program as an educator in a disadvantaged public school saw the program mature, over a two-year period, for year 11 and 12 students. At first, students were withdrawn from class for small group tutoring. As the rapport developed with both student and teacher I then moved into the classroom and provided support in targeted areas. That transition proved invaluable. Not only did HSC results improve but more importantly I saw students emerge with a determination to continue to learn and grow down the track.

Since March 1987, South by Southwest (SXSW) has drawn thousands of attendees to a rolling ten day \u2018festival of festivals\u2019 event in Austin, Texas that has grown to combine parallel film and music festivals, a gaming expo, and a technology conference stream featuring stellar speakers.

There have been a couple of such stories in the past week. One was in a small township in Queensland where the local council elected to provide a gift of ham to every resident. The second was how the mayor of the City of Kingston fosters children who may not otherwise share in the goodwill of Christmas (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-children-doing-it-tough-this-christmas-and-the-mayor-making-a-difference-20231218-p5es49.html\">The mayor fostering Christmas spirit</url>\", 19/12).There are no doubt many people who do similar acts but go unnoticed by those outside of their community. They may not share in any awards that are handed out by various government authorities, and do not seek them, but all of us should be thankful such acts of goodwill and kindness exists, and perhaps in a way spur all of us to consider what we can do should the opportunity arise.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bruce MacKenzie, South Kingsville</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Things are getting better</emphasis>I would've agreed with your correspondent about humankind's self-destruction (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/government-needs-to-shift-immigration-settings-20231218-p5es8m.html\">\"The road to ruin\", Letters</url>, 19/12), until I discovered evidence that today, anyone's chances of being killed violently are infinitesimally small compared with the long past, and the trend is continuing, despite the wars, big and small. That's consistent with whoever noticed that over the long arc of human history, things do get better - even though it's hard to see. We should keep hoping and working towards good outcomes. The alternative is despair and inaction.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Greig, Colac</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dangers ignored</emphasis>I fear your correspondent may be correct: there is little likelihood that humanity will make the changes necessary for our children and grandchildren to inherit a sustainable, liveable environment. We have, particularly since the advent of television and its advertisers' depictions of \"better lifestyles\", embraced pleasure and convenience ahead of maintaining a sustainable environment. While at first we did this in ignorance of the risks, in recent decades we have clung to these sybaritic priorities in full knowledge of the dangers. We still have time to stem this environmental damage, but must change our priorities. One immediate step will be to support David Pocock's Climate Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity) Bill, which seeks to make the environmental interests of future generations of paramount importance in all federal government decision-making.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Young, Surrey Hills</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human help</emphasis>It is extraordinary for your correspondent to say that the survival of the Earth's complex ecosystem \"doesn't need mankind\". Changes can occur in nature that are not always good for the planet, and such things as managed logging and farming and fishing and mining can actually contribute to its wellbeing.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Drum, Coburg</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The end of the world</emphasis>Recent correspondence highlights the inability of humans to exist within the Earth's ecosystem.

After 14billion years of evolution, the natural world never loses. Only anthropological arrogance and magical thinking believes that nature will just keep on giving what is needed to sustain life despite the unsustainable environmental damage that is being done to it.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Miller, Box Hill South</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peak problems</emphasis>Peak human is yet to come, but peak humanity seems well in the past.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ralph B\u00f6hmer, St Kilda West</emphasis></p><h>THE FORUM</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Think smaller</emphasis>The real tragedy of the state's Big Build program is not the ubiquitous cost blowouts (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/credit-agency-warns-victoria-over-further-budget-blowouts-20231218-p5es8x.html\">Agency warns state's credit rating at risk from project blowouts</url>\", 19/12) but the diversion of funds away from the smaller, often more important, local project that saves lives and maintains our standard of living. The recent death of a toddler on Stud Road (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/plea-for-crossing-ignored-council-says-after-toddler-dies-on-death-trap-road-20231218-p5es47.html\">Crossing plea ignored, says council after toddler death</url>\", 19/12) brings to the fore the human cost of underinvesting in walking and cycling infrastructure. Funds are prioritised for major stadiums, roads and railways because, we are told, people vote for them. In this process there is no room for the projects we need but are too small to attract the requisite number of votes.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eric Keys, Flemington</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cost comes home</emphasis>It should have been clear from the outset, but it's now only belatedly apparent: governments can't make up for many decades of underexpenditure on public infrastructure in just a few years. Not without serious financial consequences. The current situation has been worsened by temporarily low interest rates in the recent past encouraging even greater overreach by ministers and their political advisers, in cahoots with profit-centred corporations in the construction industry. So much for purchase contracts for major capital works, spuriously dressed up as so-called private-public partnerships. Where's the frank and fearless advice from an independent public service to provide what's missing in all this - sound planning and prudent management of public debt, combined with competent contract management?<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lawrie Bradly, Surrey Hills </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A road too far, too wide</emphasis>The actual North East Link is needed, and is a fait accompli. However, the need to widen the Eastern Freeway, which to date is regarded as a part of the above project, is very dubious. It should to be deferred until the link road is open, with the need for it to be reassessed at that time. The state government must surely stop being reckless with taxpayers' money.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Robinson, Ringwood East</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gateways closed</emphasis>Jago Dodson paints a compelling picture of the significant deficiencies of the approval processes for very large public projects in Victoria (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/yet-another-multibillion-dollar-cost-blowout-it-s-a-mockery-of-democracy-20231217-p5es0c.html\">Repeated transport blowouts a blight on our democracy</url>\", 18/12). However, it is not accurate to imply that all such projects proposed and implemented by the current government have been endorsed by the public on the basis that the platform the government took to the election included these projects. The election gives the voter the opportunity to vote only \"on balance\" for, or against, a large package of projects. In contrast to the current arrangements, before the 1990s such independent organisations as the Country Roads Board, Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, and State Electricity Commission developed long-term planning and implementation strategies. There were many more project development \"gates\" that any large public project had to pass before reaching the final stage of execution - a good thing that has been lost.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lawrence Edward Gebert, Blackburn</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fossil fuel battle</emphasis>Congratulations to Tanya Plibersek and Labor on practical steps to replace carbon-emitting coal and gas with renewables (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/renewables-surge-but-higher-coal-exports-fuel-greens-ire-20231218-p5es5m.html\">Labor hails green shift as coal surges</url>\", 19/12), as well as on specific environmental protections. But vetoing some new coal projects does not sound enough. And what about existing mines? A 9 per cent increase in coal exports next year does not fit with the COP28 \"transition away\" from fossil fuels. It's certainly true that there was, as Plibersek says, a \"denial and delay\" on climate action under the Liberals, one of the issues that lost them the last election. But the denial is ongoing, and it affects public perceptions of what we need to do.The Liberals pay lip service to emissions targets while supporting expensive long-term nuclear (despite having virtually ignored it for nine years). The current political climate may be restraining Labor. The opposition LNP is concentrating (understandably) on interest rates and cost of living. More should be done to promote a strong economy based on renewables. The alternative will be regular and ongoing droughts, floods and fires.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Hughes, Mentone</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coal contradiction</emphasis>How can the federal government both hail green energy and increase coal? Obviously, the words and consequent actions are contradictory and meaningless. In contrast, the Greens are correct in pushing for blocking \"projects driving climate change\". In short, Plibersek, Bowen and colleagues must speed up the Safeguard Mechanism (for decarbonising) and the Capacity Investment Scheme (for renewables and grid); and do this as a New Year resolution in January 2024.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Fraser, Burwood </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Community-minded</emphasis>As a single-earring-wearing 20-something who looks like Y2K vomited up all of its worst clothes, I was ready to roll my eyes while reading the first few paragraphs of Darren Levin's piece on Caulfield South (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-suburb-where-everyone-knows-your-name-and-your-marital-status-20231205-p5ep6b.html\">We're Gen Z-free and fur babies rule</url>\", 19/12.) However, as I got through it, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself smiling at the neighbourly interactions that were, if not the same, analogous to my home suburb. It rams home the reality that we're all just looking for some community. I just beg that older generations stop using the word \"woke\" as if it were my generation's bible - no one says \"woke\", no one tries to be \"woke\", we're all just trying to be good people.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Renzo Tweedie, Brunswick</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curse</emphasis>Christopher Bantick is sick of swearing (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/i-ve-tried-asking-people-to-stop-swearing-it-doesn-t-go-well-20231215-p5erug.html\">I swear our discourse is getting ruder by the day</url>\", 19/12). I agree - and I love a well-placed swear word. But I'm tired of hearing people swear because they can't be bothered using their vocabularies to think of a more appropriate word. People will also use a swear word as an adjective far too often - often in the use of \"like\", another word I hear so much of.

Surreally, the electoral implications of Trump becoming a convicted felon are being underestimated.It is surely stretching credulity to think that US voters could abandon the cherished notion of patriotism and countenance a known amoral criminal as their national leader.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jon McMillan, Mount Eliza</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Putin's rival</emphasis>Yekaterina Duntsova, 40, a Russian journalist and single mother of three, has announced she will run against Putin for the presidency of Russia in the next elections.

While it is true that showing concern over the casualties in Gaza, or criticising Israel's military conduct, aren't antisemitic, the nature or conduct of attacks on Israel can make them antisemitic. It's antisemitic to deny Israel's right to exist, which is to deny Jewish people the same right - and self-determination in their homeland. Accusing Israel of being as bad as the Nazis is antisemitic, as is aiming demonstrations at or graffiti attacks at synagogues, for example, or boycotting businesses owned by Australian Jews.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robbie Gore, Brighton East</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Revenue raised</emphasis>Your correspondent provides a long list of costs incurred by the government in facilitating duck hunting but fails to mention the revenue generated from hunting licences, waterfowl identification tests and firearm ownership licences (\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/government-needs-to-shift-immigration-settings-20231218-p5es8m.html\">Cut hunting costs\", Letters</url>, 19/12).

We provide this service in a professional, caring and empowering way. We assist all women who walk through our door, regardless of age, ethnicity, sexuality or ability and they are treated in a way we expect all women to be treated in all aspects of their lives: with respect, dignity and kindness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We also support feminist health initiatives, organisations or services that respond to unmet needs, gaps, challenges or prejudices in systems and sectors that negatively impact women's and girls' health.</p><p>With over 3000 women a year attending the Centre, we are a vital and dynamic component of the primary health care system in the Illawarra.</p><p>We launched our 2023-27 strategic plan at the end of last year. It outlines our ambitious agenda for the next five years, including doubling our services by opening a second site in northern Illawarra, and to expanding our advocacy as we fight for equitable, timely and safe and affordable access to health services.</p><p>Central to our work is our commitment to listen, hear and stand with women.</p><p>We draw strength and purpose from our feminist foundations and each day we work through a feminist lens that is reflective, flexible and forward thinking. This means we understand, and value, women's lived experience and expertise and we recognise the continued discrimination and structural inequality women face in our community and wider Australian society. It also means we recognise the ongoing need for a gendered analysis and approach to health, continuing empowerment of women and girls, and strong advocacy for gender equity and women's rights.</p><p>We embrace a social view of health, as framed by the World Health Organisation, which recognises health status is shaped by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age.</p><p>For example, factors such as financial security, affordable housing, education, employment, disability, racism, locational disadvantage, gender inequity and discrimination based on sexual identity and preferences cause health inequalities, which impact directly on women's health outcomes.</p><p>Over the past few years there have been negative, seismic and destabilising changes in our world - both locally and globally - all of which have a disproportional impact on women and girls. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual, domestic and family violence rates, as well as mental illness rates will be very high for many years to come, with the full effect of Long COVID still yet to be seen and understood. The housing crisis, with women over 55 the fastest growing group of homeless people, has no foreseeable end unless radical, just, and resourcing changes are made urgently.</p><p>The increasing cost of living, the soaring price of energy, and the potential global recession all impact those in the most vulnerable and marginalised circumstances. Finally, the impact of climate change currently and in the future including natural disasters, global migration and distress will inevitably result in loss, grief and trauma that will reverberate through the generations. It is critical that we continue working to understand how these overarching political, economic, cultural, and climate change forces will affect women's daily lives, their health and access to health services in the Illawarra - and that we continue our fight for health, education, racial and climate equity, and safety and justice.</p><p>With these pressures, and a strong and positive reputation in the community, the demand on our Centre has dramatically increased in the last few years. Consequently, we are planning for growth in services, in order to meet the ever-increasing needs of women and girls in the Illawarra. Noting the forthcoming establishment of the Women's Trauma Recovery Centre, our primary focus in the next five years will be on: sexual and reproductive health, mental and emotional health and wellbeing, and social and community connection.</p><p>So .... here's a heads-up! You are going to keep hearing from us at the Illawarra Women's Health Centre. We will continue to raise our voices advocating for women-led social change. We will continue to fight for accessible non-judgemental abortion services. We will continue to fight for urgent family and criminal law reform and improved legal support services for victims of domestic and family violence, put the focus on perpetrators and prevent devastated mothers and children being sent back into high risk domestic, family and sexual violence situations, as we have witnessed over decades.</p><p>We will fight for single mothers whose health and wellbeing are impacted twice as much by their parenting responsibilities and the social, legal and economic injustices they experience. We will fight the abusive and degrading public representation of women, especially in the media and through pornography and we will expand our support for women with lived experience of violence, abuse and our prejudicial health system.</p><p>We promise to do our best and we will celebrate our wins, because - let me say this - we do intend to win.</p><p>Because we know that when all women contribute, have choices and make decisions regarding their own lives, their families, in workplaces and the wider community, we all win.</p><p>Judy Daunt is vice-chairwoman of Illawarra Women's Health Centre Judy Daunt</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ILMYAU-doc7p9uqvalkttrij96b1i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ILMYAU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67RJ-5GN1-F0J6-J2D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314241</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Illawarra Newspapers Holding Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Illawarra Mercury</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 11, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Social commitment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Equality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congresses</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D89F</classCode><className>FEMINISM &amp;

But 12 have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018, and New Zealand is near the top of this group.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As part of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement</url>, countries were asked to submit emissions reduction targets. These Nationally Determined Contributions (<url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs\">NDCs</url>) are a measure of a nation's commitment to contribute to the goal of limiting warming to well below 2?.</p><p>New Zealand submitted its NDC in 2015, with a headline target of bringing emissions down over the coming decade to 30% below 2005 levels. But this is not what it seems. </p><p>New Zealand's NDC <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/climate-commission-to-review-nzs-paris-target\">confuses</url> the issue by adopting a target of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">net</emphasis> emissions in 2030 compared to a baseline of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">gross</emphasis> emissions in 2005. This target actually allows New Zealand to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/emissions-reduction-targets/projected-emissions\">increase</url> net emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: By declaring a climate emergency Jacinda Ardern needs to inspire hope, not fear</emphasis></p><p>Last year, New Zealand introduced the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/zero-carbon-amendment-act\">Zero Carbon Act</url>, making it one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law. But current short-term policies do not yet keep up with the ambition to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p><h>Fair and ambitious climate action</h><p>It was clear at the time of the Paris Agreement that countries' initial targets would be woefully insufficient for limiting warming to well below 2?. Therefore, the agreement requires countries to show a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf\">progression over time</url>\" to reflect each country's \"highest possible ambition\". </p><p>In addition to increasingly more ambitious targets, countries were also asked to explain why their intended contribution to the common aim was fair. <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10784-017-9381-x\">Many did so</url>, but not New Zealand. </p><p>Some countries argued their contribution was fair because their total share of global emissions was small. Others said their per-capita emissions were small, while some high-emitting nations pointed out their per-capita emissions were falling. If those arguments weren't applicable, some countries said it was particularly hard for them to reduce emissions, so their fair share should be smaller. </p><p>As any child in the playground complaining \"That's not fair!\" would recognise, these are just self-serving excuses for inaction, rather than justifiable bases for determining fairness. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Why our response to climate change needs to be a just and careful revolution that limits pushback</emphasis></p><h>Who decides what's fair</h><p>The official United Nations (UN) review of climate plans won't happen until 2023. For now, we have to rely on outside assessments. Two major ones, by <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/\">Climate Action Tracker</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"http://climateequityreference.org\">Climate Equity Reference Project</url>, illustrate some possible approaches.</p><p>Climate Action Tracker argues an approach is fair if it would lead to the outcomes agreed in Paris, were it to be followed by all countries. On that basis, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/new-zealand/\">New Zealand's NDC</url> was rated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/122341331/nz-rated-insufficient-on-climate-action-again\">insufficient</url>, consistent with a world that would be 3? warmer. </p><p>The Climate Equity Reference Project attempts to <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10784-017-9371-z\">determine</url> universally agreed criteria of fairness, based on UN agreements and on discussions with social, environmental, development and faith groups around the world. They found there should be a component of historical responsibility - who got us into this mess, and who benefited from it? </p><p>This can be assessed by cumulative emissions from some starting point, such as 1850 or 1950. There should also be an element based on a country's ability to act, assessed by GDP above a certain threshold. </p><p>Under this approach, New Zealand's <url normalizedValue=\"https://calculator.climateequityreference.org/\">target</url> would need to be for net emissions to reach zero by 2030, and to go negative after that by storing carbon and by investing in emission reductions in other countries.  These conclusions were recently endorsed in a detailed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oxfam.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oxfam-NZ-Briefing-A-Fair-2030-Target-for-Aotearoa.pdf\">study</url> by Oxfam NZ. </p><p>Zero net emissions by 2030 is just not possible. New Zealand hasn't even <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">started</url> reducing emissions yet. </p><h>Wealthy nations should shoulder more responsibility</h><p>So what can you do when you've agreed to something that you can't achieve? The first step has to be to acknowledge the situation and to determine a fair contribution. New Zealand hasn't done that yet - our present NDC (updated in April 2020 to reflect the Zero Carbon Act) does not mention fairness. </p><p>The second step is to work out the highest possible ambition. For example, New Zealand could follow the EU lead of cutting emissions by a further <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eu-climate-action/2030_ctp_en\">42-48%</url> in the next decade. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatecommission.govt.nz/\">Climate Change Commission</url>, set up under the Zero Carbon Act, gives New Zealand a framework for addressing this. The commission is expected to release a consultation document in February, reviewing the NDC and preparing emissions budgets out to 2035. </p><p>The commission's chair, Rod Carr, has acknowledged the importance of fairness in determining the NDC, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/climate-chief-rod-carr-on-agriculture-fairness-and-optimism\">saying</url>:</p><p>I think fair share is a really good conversation for New Zealanders to have   [...] We're a wealthy, developed nation. The wealthy nations, with the higher incomes per capita, do have a responsibility for doing more than the average. </p><p>The commission will also advise on how much of New Zealand's contribution should be met domestically or internationally, and how much should be met by planting trees versus actually reducing emissions. </p><p>The latter is already a contentious issue, as the payments for \"carbon farming\" (which New Zealand's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mfe.govt.nz/ets\">Emissions Trading Scheme</url>, uniquely in the world, includes) are leading to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/116842839/govt-gives-japaneseowned-forestry-company-free-pass-to-buy-new-zealand-land\">unrest</url> in the farming and environment sectors. </p><p>If people are paid to store carbon in trees today, who bears the responsibility for maintaining that store indefinitely, and who bears the <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10784-017-9382-9\">risk</url> should it fail?</p><p>Climate change minister James Shaw has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/123360658/nz-now-behind-china-on-climate-pledges--james-shaw\">acknowledged</url> the present target is weak, compared to what the US, EU and China are now considering, and that he is expecting a stronger target to be recommended by the commission next year.</p><p>New Zealand has put in place new institutions and mechanisms to cut emissions and to phase out fossil fuels.

But many green groups and scientists say that this is still not good enough. Biden's initiative may have won praise from political allies, but these campaigners want to see a different calculus rooted in history and ethics. To keep the world from tilting into catastrophic warming, they argue, developed nations that got rich burning fossil fuels must face their historic responsibility for the climate crisis -- and pay for it, too. </p><p>When countries struck the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, they committed to limit global temperature rises to \"well below\" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Farenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels.  Nations also agreed to strive for a safer warming cap of 1.5C through voluntary emissions-cutting plans, known as National Determined Contributions, or NDCs, that would be ratcheted up in scope and ambition every five years. \"What they refused to allow was any assessment of how the individual pledges compared to each other,\" Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, told AFP.  The concept of \"fair share\" emissions cuts has been gaining traction among environmental and human rights organisations for several years AFP / SAUL LOEB \"As civil society, we thought that was a really crucial piece of the puzzle -- it's important both whether all the pledges add up to the 1.5C goal, but it's also important whether they're fair relative to one another.\"The concept of \"fair share\" emissions cuts has been gaining traction among environmental and human rights organisations for years.  The methodology is simple enough: calculate the amount of carbon currently in Earth's atmosphere attributable to a specific country's historic greenhouse gas emissions, then factor in that country's capacity -- measured in wealth -- to help other nations reduce their own emissions.  This year a coalition of around 175 climate groups launched US Climate Fair Share. Far from an emissions cut of 50 percent by 2030, the groups said the US's \"fair share\" would be equivalent to 195 percent of 2005 levels. Chart showing the \"fair share\" concept of US carbon emission cuts, which takes into account a country's economic clout, as well as historic emissions. AFP / John SAEKI That means the US would need to nearly completely decarbonise its own economy, then facilitate significant emissions cuts in countries around the world through investment in clean energy and infrastructure.  \"Even if we go 100-percent zero emissions -- not net-zero, but real zero -- by 2030, that's still not our fair share, because we have such a historical legacy of climate pollution,\" said Wu. \"We're not calling for negative emissions or anything like that. We're calling for international finance to support reductions elsewhere.\"Climate Action Tracker, a think tank that compiles and evaluates national emissions reduction plans, found that the pledges made during last month's summit would, if fully implemented, knock 0.2C off projected warming.  US President Joe Biden was praised by political allies for his emissions cutting pledges AFP / JIM WATSON But the \"emissions gap\" between what has been promised and what is needed to stay below 1.5C remains enormous: even the latest round of commitments would -- if honoured -- still see Earth warm 2.4C this century. Michael Mann, director of Penn State's Earth System Science Center and author of \"The New Climate War\", told AFP that the emissions gap does not account for \"fair share\" cuts. \"It simply tells us what the global reductions in carbon emissions must be to achieve certain critical targets -- for example to avoid dangerous 1.5C warming,\" he said.  \"How they are divided up is a matter of policy, politics and ethics,\" he added.  \"Speaking as a concerned citizen, and not just a scientist, I do think countries like the US with a legacy of two centuries of producing carbon pollution have a special obligation to lead.\" The US is by far history's largest emitter, accounting for more than 28 percent of all carbon pollution since 1850. Yet it is far from alone in having an outsized historical contribution to climate change.  The Climate Equity Reference project, launched by think tanks EcoEquity and the Stockholm Environment Institute, applies the bedrock UN climate treaty principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\" to managing Earth's remaining carbon budget. Climate vulnerable nations with virtually no responsibility for historic emissions, can 'fairly' continue roughly along current emissions lines and still keep 1.5C in play AFP / MUNIR UZ ZAMAN Their fair-share calculator shows that -- in a scenario where 1.5C is achieved through emissions cuts alone -- the European Union should reduce its carbon pollution by the equivalent of 170 percent.  In total, high-income countries would need to slash emissions by 136 percent, the calculator shows. Conversely, climate vulnerable nations with virtually no responsibility for historic emissions, can \"fairly\" continue roughly along current emissions lines such that 1.5C remains in play. \"It sounds dry and complex but it's really just basic ethics,\" said Wu. \"OK, who made this mess? You have to clean it up.\" \"And if you have more wealth and more privilege than your neighbours, then you should correspondingly do a little more.\"Most wealthier nations plan to deploy carbon cutting schemes to help achieve their net-zero emissions targets.  In 2019, then-prime minister Theresa May pledged that Britain would \"eradicate its net contribution to climate change by 2050\". A subsequent report by the Chatham House think tank said there were \"many reasons to question\" Britain's path to net-zero, which relies heavily on carbon dioxide removal projects.  \"We have to be careful about what is hidden or swept under the rug in commitments of 'net-zero',\" said Mann.  \"Are promises of massive carbon capture based on as-yet untested -- at scale -- technology being used to excuse excessive burning of fossil fuels now? If so, then 'net-zero' is pretty hollow rhetoric.\" But even if Britain were to entirely eradicate its emissions overnight, the carbon it has polluted since the Industrial Revolution is still in the atmosphere, still influencing the climate today. Sriram Madhusoodanan, US Climate campaign director at industry watchdog Corporate Accountability, said that fair share emissions cuts were not just about doing \"what's right\", but also about keeping 1.5C a viable target. \"Without keeping fossil fuels in the ground, drastically reducing emissions immediately, and advancing real, accessible solutions at scale, we are on track to blow past the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" he said.The US Climate Fair share organisers calculated that it should reduce emissions by 70 percent by 2030 -- only 20 percent off Biden's pledge. But given its status as the richest nation on Earth, the coalition calculated that the US should also pay to cut a total of 9 billion tonnes of CO2 globally by 2030.  Since the cost of zero-carbon technologies varies greatly between countries, the math involved in putting a cost figure on such action is challenging.  But the NGOs arrived at what Wu termed a \"bare minimum\" figure: $800 billion this decade.  \"That would make a real impact and send a signal internationally,\" said Wu, while pointing out that the US's military budget currently stands at $750 billion in the next fiscal year alone.  \"Morals aside, unless we do this the climate crisis does not get solved and we have no chance of achieving 1.5C,\" he said.  \"And because we have this international system where everything is voluntary, if countries don't see that other countries are pulling their weight then they have no incentive to participate,\" Wu added.  \"We've had this 'first mover' problem forever.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857162071346125525976100123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N2-KN61-F03R-N21B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1339\"/><timeReceived>6:11 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 11, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>ACTIONAID INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

He won the 2016 election against a sure-bet Democrat with a political pedigree and the global media on her side. He won the second-biggest popular vote in US electoral history last week despite a four-year onslaught by the political media elite. On present numbers, he has increased the Republican share of Hispanic voters and improved his standing among African-Americans. Trump has forever changed American politics and the breadth of his achievements impresses where his style, and his handling of the pandemic fail.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>The 45th US president restored law and order by defending police against militant racists and nominating black-letter lawyers to the Supreme Court. He chipped away at left-wing orthodoxy in the public service and on campus by testing the limits of free speech. He demanded equal treatment for America in foreign policy by telling free-riding allies to boost their military spending and pay their fair share for defence. He called the bluff of bully states and withdrew US money from the Paris Agreement, which rewards totalitarian regimes with Western workers' money. He protected Americans from illiberal enemies by closing the border to terrorist-producing states. He defended Israel by negotiating the most celebrated Middle East peace deal in recent history. He encouraged the revival of American manufacturing in towns gripped by unemployment and sliding into the despair of intergenerational opioid addiction. And he worked to restore the democratic norms established by the founding fathers. Trump stood for the millions of Americans that globalists treat like an unpleasant aftertaste of the industrial era. For all of that, the politically correct will forever regard him as an enemy.</p><p/><p>As the votes rolled in on Wednesday night, Trumpism was the topic of discussion on the ABC. Although the host noted the Democrat landslide had failed to materialise (again), he could not resist describing Americans who support Trump as a cult. But the description is more aptly used for Democrat voters given their call to blacklist political dissenters in the wake of the election. Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested the names of people who worked with the US president should be recorded for their \"complicity.\" </p><p/><p>Michael Simon, a former Obama administration staffer, affirmed that a group was recording the names of \"Every (Trump) administration staffer, campaign staffer, bundler, lawyers who represented them - everyone\". He is in league with another former Democrat staffer, Emily Abrams, who tweeted on November 6: \"We're launching the Trump Accountability Project to make sure anyone who took a paycheck to help Trump ... is held responsible.\"</p><p>In other media, journalists worked hard to define the contours of Trumpism to confirm their bias against him. They regurgitated speaking points from the 2016 Clinton campaign, smearing the Republican base as uneducated, white, working-class and stupid. In other words, deplorable. </p><p/><p>Ahead of the election, The Guardian's David Smith lamented that even if Trump were to lose, it would not \"defeat Trumpism\". Smith characterised crowd support for the former president on the campaign trail as \"cult-of-personality\" rallies. Consistent with many articles against Trump, an academic was used to strengthen the prosecution. Eddie Glaude, author of Democracy in Black, said Trump flourished because of white voters. </p><p>In The Sydney Morning Herald, Peter Hartcher interviewed Francis Fukuyama, an academic whose end-of-history idea was one of the most popular and spectacularly flawed theories of the late 20th century. Like many globalists who dreamed of a virtuous internationalist order that never was, Fukuyama stereotypes Republican voters as a \"narrow and unrepresentative base of white, working-class, poorly educated people resentful about all the changes going on in society\". When globalists so belittle conservatives, the charge of resentfulness is an exercise in projection. </p><p/><p>Despite the many headlines celebrating Joe Biden as a moderating force, the future of America under the Democrats is not centrist in any meaningful sense of the word. Even if Biden were to remake himself in the image of Arthur Schlesinger's centrism, the challenge of containing Chinese communist aggression abroad and tempering the increasingly belligerent left in government would remain. He has shown little talent for either. </p><p>To get a taste of the political struggle to come, consider how Ocasio-Cortez uses race as a weapon. In a congressional hearing, she said: \"The people who are producing climate change ... [are] predominantly white, correct?\" In August, vice-president elect Kamala Harris and Ocasio-Cortez jointly introduced the Climate Equity Act, which uses climate change as a rationale to embed inequality and anti-democratic processes in policy. It would introduce an equity score for environmental legislation based on race and economic status.</p><p/><p> In a press release, Harris explained the Act would require climate legislation and grants be developed by a designated office and \"frontline communities\", defined as: \"Those that have experienced systemic socioeconomic disparities, environmental racism ... low-income communities, indigenous peoples and communities of colour\". Ocasio-Cortez took it a step further and openly embraced the new form of apartheid, demanding: \"Environmental policies must be written by the black, brown and low-income people ... just like the Green New Deal envisioned.\" This is not a case of white supremacists headbanging for Hitler and tattooing each other in a backyard shed. It is the incoming government of the US. </p><p>When Trump won the 2016 election, the shock was registered on the downcast expression of TV anchors worldwide. The public berated pollsters who got it wrong while journalists rushed to revise their crude liberal bias for fear of being seen as irrelevant. Now the tables have turned and so has the media, whose barely concealed contempt for dissent has been liberated by the prospect of a Democrat president. But Trump is not a ghost of presidents past, he represents a movement of people who want formal equality, freedom of speech, strong borders, an impartial judiciary and depoliticised education for children. With a party that supports formal inequality, racist governance and political censorship about to form government, the battle for the American Dream has only just begun.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He won the 2016 election against a sure-bet Democrat with a political pedigree and the global media on her side. He won the second-biggest popular vote in US electoral history last week despite a four-year onslaught by the political media elite. On present numbers, he has increased the Republican share of Hispanic voters and improved his standing among African-Americans. Trump has forever changed American politics and the breadth of his achievements impresses where his style, and his handling of the pandemic fail.</p><p>The 45th US president restored law and order by defending police against militant racists and nominating black-letter lawyers to the Supreme Court. He chipped away at left-wing orthodoxy in the public service and on campus by testing the limits of free speech. He demanded equal treatment for America in foreign policy by telling free-riding allies to boost their military spending and pay their fair share for defence. He called the bluff of bully states and withdrew US money from the Paris Agreement, which rewards totalitarian regimes with Western workers' money. He protected Americans from illiberal enemies by closing the border to terrorist-producing states. He defended Israel by negotiating the most celebrated Middle East peace deal in recent history. He encouraged the revival of American manufacturing in towns gripped by unemployment and sliding into the despair of intergenerational opioid addiction. And he worked to restore the democratic norms established by the founding fathers. Trump stood for the millions of Americans that globalists treat like an unpleasant aftertaste of the industrial era. For all of that, the politically correct will forever regard him as an enemy.</p><p>As the votes rolled in on Wednesday night, Trumpism was the topic of discussion on the ABC. Although the host noted the Democrat landslide had failed to materialise (again), he could not resist describing Americans who support Trump as a cult. But the description is more aptly used for Democrat voters given their call to blacklist political dissenters in the wake of the election. Democrat congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez suggested the names of people who worked with the US president should be recorded for their \"complicity.\" Michael Simon, a former Obama administration staffer, affirmed that a group was recording the names of \"Every (Trump) administration staffer, campaign staffer, bundler, lawyers who represented them - everyone\". He is in league with another former Democrat staffer, Emily Abrams, who tweeted on November 6: \"We're launching the Trump Accountability Project to make sure anyone who took a paycheck to help Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is held responsible.\" In other media, journalists worked hard to define the contours of Trumpism to confirm their bias against him. They regurgitated speaking points from the 2016 Clinton campaign, smearing the Republican base as uneducated, white, working-class and stupid. In other words, deplorable.</p><p>Ahead of the election, The Guardian's David Smith lamented that even if Trump were to lose, it would not \"defeat Trumpism\". Smith characterised crowd support for the former president on the campaign trail as \"cult-of-personality\" rallies. Consistent with many articles against Trump, an academic was used to strengthen the prosecution. Eddie Glaude, author of Democracy in Black, said Trump flourished because of white voters.</p><p>In The Sydney Morning Herald, Peter Hartcher interviewed Francis Fukuyama, an academic whose end-of-history idea was one of the most popular and spectacularly flawed theories of the late 20th century. Like many globalists who dreamed of a virtuous internationalist order that never was, Fukuyama stereotypes Republican voters as a \"narrow and unrepresentative base of white, working-class, poorly educated people resentful about all the changes going on in society\". When globalists so belittle conservatives, the charge of resentfulness is an exercise in projection.</p><p>Despite the many headlines celebrating Joe Biden as a moderating force, the future of America under the Democrats is not centrist in any meaningful sense of the word. Even if Biden were to remake himself in the image of Arthur Schlesinger's centrism, the challenge of containing Chinese communist aggression abroad and tempering the increasingly belligerent left in government would remain. He has shown little talent for either.</p><p>To get a taste of the political struggle to come, consider how Ocasio-Cortez uses race as a weapon. In a congressional hearing, she said: \"The people who are producing climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [are] predominantly white, correct?\" In August, vice-president elect Kamala Harris and Ocasio-Cortez jointly introduced the Climate Equity Act, which uses climate change as a rationale to embed inequality and anti-democratic processes in policy. It would introduce an equity score for environmental legislation based on race and economic status. In a press release, Harris explained the Act would require climate legislation and grants be developed by a designated office and \"frontline communities\", defined as: \"Those that have experienced systemic socioeconomic disparities, environmental racism \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 low-income communities, indigenous peoples and communities of colour\". Ocasio-Cortez took it a step further and openly embraced the new form of apartheid, demanding: \"Environmental policies must be written by the black, brown and low-income people \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just like the Green New Deal envisioned.\" This is not a case of white supremacists headbanging for Hitler and tattooing each other in a backyard shed. It is the incoming government of the US. When Trump won the 2016 election, the shock was registered on the downcast expression of TV anchors worldwide. The public berated pollsters who got it wrong while journalists rushed to revise their crude liberal bias for fear of being seen as irrelevant. Now the tables have turned and so has the media, whose barely concealed contempt for dissent has been liberated by the prospect of a Democrat president. But Trump is not a ghost of presidents past, he represents a movement of people who want formal equality, freedom of speech, strong borders, an impartial judiciary and depoliticised education for children. With a party that supports formal inequality, racist governance and political censorship about to form government, the battle for the American Dream has only just begun.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-98a1f24e225211eba1b45a5e0e2799cd0fb60a8987db0b4d4197e880ddff757c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6186-2Y51-JD3N-538Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp;

This debate plays to the music of many axes grinding. Not everyone will be pleased.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nevertheless, this is a very creative and accessible report. In suggesting that global warming is occurring faster than predicted due to high global economic growth driven by China, Garnaut paints a bleak picture of the future unless we take significant action now. Garnaut has gone further than expected by proposing extreme reductions in emissions, and that Australia lead by example.</p><p>Garnaut lines up with current scientific opinion in endorsing a target of stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to limit the average temperature rise this century to about two degrees. This ambitious target, which has been endorsed by the EU, reflects a concern that a rise of even that could trigger some kind of tipping point. It also recognises that the mood of the international community is shifting rapidly in favour of taking significant remedial action.</p><p>In terms of how we get there, Garnaut swims in the economic mainstream, favouring an emissions trading scheme with increasingly tight caps on emissions. Extending the scheme internationally will provide a range of cheaper abatement options and Garnaut suggests that Australia should work with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. He also argues for government subsidies for research and development in low-emission technology and for investment in essential network infrastructure.</p><p>When Garnaut moves from efficiency to equity, as his terms of reference require, his review becomes more contentious. Domestically, Garnaut argues that high emitters should not be compensated for the introduction of a price on carbon because he says far-sighted investors should have provided for a carbon price and there is no tradition in Australia of compensating for policy changes.</p><p>Garnaut argues that industries that were subject to reductions in tariff protection in the 1980s and 1990s were not \"compensated\", but acknowledges that those most disadvantaged were provided with \"adjustment assistance\". This is splitting hairs. Owners of capital in the highly protected car and textile, clothing and footwear industries were given substantial ongoing support. The motor vehicle industry will receive about $2 billion in the five years to 2010.</p><p>Garnaut's judgement on international equity also differs significantly from Australia's long-standing position. By embracing the \"contraction and convergence\" approach favoured by developing countries and based on converging per capita emissions, Australia would effectively shoulder a greater abatement task than any other country. Our per capita emissions are the second highest in the developed world, but we also have a relatively high rate of population growth. Reducing per capita emissions over time to the level of India (whose emissions would be permitted to grow for many years) would require Australia to reduce its emissions by about 90% by 2050. This is not likely to be practical or efficient.</p><p>\u00b7 It is important to break the nexus between carbon intensity and economic wellbeing. This means developing low-emission technology that can support high living standards anywhere.</p><p>\u00b7 The most efficient way of reducing emissions is to establish a global target with a market mechanism such as emissions trading. While developed countries need to take action first, this global target needs to be introduced as soon as possible.</p><p>\u00b7 If a global scheme is inequitable between countries, that is best tackled with appropriate compensation rather than allowing some countries to increase emissions.</p><p>\u00b7 Not only would Garnaut's approach have severe implications for the Australian economy, it ensures ongoing US opposition - probably the most important argument against it.</p><p>Garnaut's review will greatly increase the community's understanding of the complexities of climate change and will be of considerable benefit to policymakers. It is when he steps off the well-trodden path of economic efficiency and into the equity jungle that Garnaut will have a tough argument on his hands.</p><p>Jon Stanford is a partner with Deloitte Economics in Melbourne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5j0fvvo5p7cl9k8f1xx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4S09-9CV0-TXN5-S04D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>March 6, 2008 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Weather/Greenhouse Effect</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Business &amp;

This is a very negative way of looking at the problem of generating jobs. The debate centres on taking away benefits from low-end workers.</p><p>The large Australian employers of yesteryear are mature private-sector industries or public-sector entities which are, in keeping with global trends, all shedding jobs. Today they are downsizing, outsourcing or struggling to be internationally competitive. Slowing tariff reduction for motor vehicles and TCF is a similar attempt to slow the inevitable job losses.</p><p>Jobs are generated by investment in high-growth industries. Australia has made another choice - not to fully participate in the information technology industry, the greatest generator of well-paid new jobs in the past 10 years. We are world-class importers and users of IT but have failed to attract our share of the world's investment and jobs associated with R&amp;D and manufacturing.</p><p>As an example, three of the fastest-growing companies of the past 10 years, Microsoft, Intel and Cisco import, sell and support in Australia but we have nowhere near captured any of the other jobs they have generated in other countries. Compare this with the loss of jobs in Australian icons GMH, BHP, Telstra and the banks.</p><p>In terms of growing our own IT companies, we have done even worse. We have chosen not to create venture capital - the high-octane fuel of young, high-growth companies in the US. You are right: we chose the employment levels we have in this country.</p><p>Roger Allen,</p><p>director, Allen &amp; Buckeridge,</p><p>Sydney, NSW.</p><p>GROUND-BREAKER</p><p>The Weekend AFR is breaking ground in several areas. One of the most outstanding changes is the layout of the stockmarket performance of tables by industry category.</p><p>You have adopted international best practice by grouping stocks by industry. It clearly shows the deficiency of your competitors. The financial world is currently obsessed with relative performance; relative to index benchmarks and baskets of comparable industry specific stocks.</p><p>Your new layout makes it easy to find and compare the best, within their industry categories. Now we can all develop stock switching strategies at a moment's glance.</p><p>Malcolm McComas,</p><p>managing director,</p><p>County NatWest Corporate Finance Aust Ltd,</p><p>Sydney, NSW.</p><p>CLIMATE EQUITY</p><p>Monday's editorial \"Aust's island diplomacy\" (AFR, September 22) perpetuates the misconception that Australia is seeking a special exemption in the climate change negotiations. This has never been the case - rather the Australian position seeks to ensure that all countries do their fair share and bear an equal economic cost in order to foster a global solution. The concerns of island nations can only be seriously addressed in a global response.</p><p>Tony Beck,</p><p>executive director,</p><p>Australian Industry Greenhouse Network,</p><p>Canberra, ACT.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-4yi5nozfx38yo2fdb2z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5573-8W21-F0J6-J48R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promptly ratified the Kyoto Protocol as his first act of government and rightly was met with accolades at Bali. But what comes next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rudd's visit to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands tomorrow provides the perfect opportunity to raise the prospect of a South Seas climate pact to propel and co-ordinate action against global warming in our region. To date, only one regional body - the European Union - has formed a \"carbon bubble\" under the Kyoto Protocol. As a result, by 2010 the EU will meet its ambitious initial collective emissions mitigation target of 8% below 1990 levels. It is confidently aiming for a subsequent target of minus 30% by 2020.</p><p>These targets are made possible through \"burden-sharing\" among EU members, enabling a more equitable and efficient approach to reducing emissions among countries of varying economic and institutional capacity.</p><p>The EU approach has also involved creating a regional carbon market that is now the centrepiece of the Kyoto carbon market, assembling a coherent regional energy strategy, and defining regional energy efficiency standards. Lastly, via the example of its leading members, it has enhanced the diffusion of institutional innovation and the implementation of renewable energy technologies.</p><p>There are some Australian precedents for a regional climate pact. Australia's most extensive multilateral climate agreement, but extensive only on paper, is the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. More important is the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, which promises a massive reduction in Indonesia's forestry-related carbon dioxide emissions, which are about 3 billion tonnes each year. Our bilateral initiatives are small, barely funded, and show no evidence of substantive outcomes.</p><p>Under John Howard, Australia had no substantial climate-related foreign policy strategy. Labor must be more ambitious. It should propose a means to co-operatively and equitably improve our region's capacity to reduce its collective emissions and to increase regional capacities for climate-related adaptation.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, East Timor, New Guinea and other near-Pacific Islands drawn from Melanesia and Polynesia (including Fiji, the Solomons, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands) are close neighbours. But the reasons for including them in a near-Pacific pact go beyond the accident of geography. They are based in equity, efficiency, ecological protection and environmental security.</p><p>First, Australia and New Zealand are wealthy developed countries, better able than most to meet the challenges of climate mitigation and adaptation. The others are poor and highly vulnerable to global warming. In terms of climate equity, the pact would direct assistance from some of the richest to some of the poorer countries in the world, including certain Pacific island nations that have contributed least to global warming, are under greatest threat from inundation, and have the least capacity to respond. Second, the region contains some of the planet's major emitting nations. Indonesia is third on the global list, Australia is 13th. A pact offers opportunities for a globally meaningful, regionally co-ordinated mitigation effort: Indonesia's and New Guinea's forests are major carbon sinks threatened by illegal (and legal) logging.</p><p>Third, these forests are threatened by rising temperatures, as are Pacific reefs, such as Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Finally, environmental security is an issue best considered pre-emptively and co-operatively. If sea levels rise and access to fresh water and food deteriorates, environmental insecurity associated with the displacement and mass migration of people will become a significant concern within our region.</p><p>The provisions of the Kyoto Protocol suggest several possible forms for such a pact. The most elaborate would involve the establishment of a new regional economic organisation along EU lines to deal with climate mitigation and adaptation. It would have its own unified emissions target to which member states contribute through national allocation plans.</p><p>Under the least formal arrangement, the pact's member states would co-ordinate their targets and activities in a way that does not depend on a regional economic organisation and therefore is not formally recognised in the Kyoto Protocol. We should aim for something between these options.</p><p>With a formal Climate Council involving national ministers, a well-funded secretariat, a collective emissions reduction target, and substantial resources to assist meeting this target, the South Pacific climate pact would be a critical focus for co-ordinated action.</p><p>Enduring institutional innovation to tackle climate change, beyond Labor's pledge of $150 million in Pacific climate aid, would greatly improve regional relations and prospects.</p><p>Peter Christoff teaches climate policy at the University of Melbourne and is Vice-President of the Australian Conservation Foundation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5izwwd7pbxcmahr51xx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4S03-HDK0-TXN5-S0CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>March 5, 2008 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Papua New Guinea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Solomon Islands</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Asia Pacific</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Weather/Greenhouse Effect</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics/Foreign Relations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Business &amp;
