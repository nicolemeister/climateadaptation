It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians.Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: THOMAS TIGHE, CEO &amp; President</p><p>SECTION 2 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 3 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION BOARD AND MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: THOMAS TIGHE, CEO &amp; President</p><p>Thomas Tighe has served as President and CEO of Direct Relief, a nonprofit humanitarian medical organization, since October 2000.

A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 04: Direct Relief Foundation For Children in Ukraine, Medical Transport Covers Last Mile to Care</p><p>When war broke out in February 2022, German paramedic Marc Friedrich was in disbelief.</p><p>\"We had imagined that there would be no more war in Europe, and then suddenly Russia attacked,\" he recalled.</p><p>That disbelief soon gave way to determination.</p><p>On March 9, an airstrike struck Mariupol's Maternity Hospital No. 3, killing four people and injuring at least 16 others.</p><p>\"That was a trigger moment for me,\" said Friedrich, who left his role as emergency services paramedic chief near Dusseldorf to establish a dedicated ambulance service for children in Ukraine.</p><p>\"I wanted to configure an ambulance specially to the needs of children, where the equipment doesn't have to be specially prepared for them but is rather the standard,\" said Friedrich, founder of Ambulance for Kids. Such emergency service vehicles are very rare in both Germany and Ukraine, Friedrich notes.</p><p>Acquiring an ambulance and equipping it for pediatric care cost at least $350,000.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise.

Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley. Frontera Healthcare Network - $50,000 to cover healthcare costs for flood survivors, provide mental health and other wraparound services to first responders, and give emergency cash assistance to health center staff experiencing serious financial impacts, enabling them to continue their work.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 5 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases.

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000. The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.</p><p>Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Direct Relief Foundation Beyond ABCs: School-Based Health Centers Provide Care for Students</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 04: Direct Relief Foundation For Children in Ukraine, Medical Transport Covers Last Mile to Care</p><p>When war broke out in February 2022, German paramedic Marc Friedrich was in disbelief.</p><p>\"We had imagined that there would be no more war in Europe, and then suddenly Russia attacked,\" he recalled.</p><p>That disbelief soon gave way to determination.</p><p>On March 9, an airstrike struck Mariupol's Maternity Hospital No. 3, killing four people and injuring at least 16 others.</p><p>\"That was a trigger moment for me,\" said Friedrich, who left his role as emergency services paramedic chief near Dusseldorf to establish a dedicated ambulance service for children in Ukraine.</p><p>\"I wanted to configure an ambulance specially to the needs of children, where the equipment doesn't have to be specially prepared for them but is rather the standard,\" said Friedrich, founder of Ambulance for Kids. Such emergency service vehicles are very rare in both Germany and Ukraine, Friedrich notes.</p><p>Acquiring an ambulance and equipping it for pediatric care cost at least $350,000.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise.

Mr Hulls will become Life360's executive chairman, having led the company for almost two decades.</p><p>Reporting its second-quarter results on Tuesday, Life360 said it logged 88 million monthly active users, a 25 per cent rise year on year. The company added 136,000 new paying customers, to 2.5 million. Quarterly revenue jumped 36 per cent year on year to $US115.4m ($176.9m) as annualised revenue rose 36 per cent, to $US416.1m.</p><p>The $6.5bn company also lifted full-year guidance, forecasting revenue of between $US462m and $US482m (up from between $US450m and $US480m) and adjusted EBITDA of between $US72m and $US82m (up from between $US65m and $US75m).</p><p>Local shares of the Nasdaq- and ASX-listed company were up 8.9 per cent to $41.20.</p><p>Citi analysts, led by Siraj Ahmed, were positive on the result, affirming a \"buy\" rating and a $90 target price. User growth and a 35 per cent rise in annual revenue per paying customer were reasons for optimism, the broker said. Ms Antonoff said Life360's continued success at a time of budgetary constraint showed the importance of the service, which was founded by Mr Hulls to help families locate each other in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWNBUL-021caaca771211f0b2933e42a1565d18aa26da37cd28b8b5824c974c9b6c6630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TWNBUL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGK-NJW3-RSB5-054Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463812</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Townsville Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Townsville Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 13, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS523150 INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>8710 (TSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>C (BMV)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>C (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000217</classCode><className>BROKER RECOMMENDATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001943</classCode><className>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE &amp;

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   DIRECT RELIEF MOBILIZES AID FOR THE CANYON FIRE IN VENTURA AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION GIFFORD FIRE RESPONSE: N95 RESPIRATORS AVAILABLE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000. The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.</p><p>Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION IN CENTRAL TEXAS, A HEALTH CENTER CARES FOR FLOOD-DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES, FIRST RESPONDERS - AND ITS STAFF</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION BEYOND ABCS: SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE CARE FOR STUDENTS</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   NASA SPOTLIGHTS DIRECT RELIEF'S USE OF SATELLITE DATA DURING LOS ANGELES FIRES</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BD, DIRECT RELIEF, AND NACHC AWARD FOUR U.S.COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FOR INNOVATION IN CARE</p><p>With support from the BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care Award, four U.S.community health centers will be able to advance their innovative care models for at-risk patient populations.</p><p>Each center is awarded $225,000 to implement pharmacist-led comprehensive medication management programs for patients - many of whom are vulnerable to chronic disease. These initiatives focus on educating and counseling patients through team-based care, while also addressing Social Determinants of Health that impact patient outcomes.</p><p>Recipients of the 2025 BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care award are:</p><p>Community Health and Social Services Center (Detroit, MI) will broaden its medication management service for individuals with Type 2 diabetes to include screening for peripheral artery disease and peripheral neuropathy. The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-13082520321478130916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGN-2J83-RWJ1-0499-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Written by and starring Mark Gatiss, it follows Gabriel Book, owner of the cheekily named Book's, a second-hand bookshop in post-war London. He's the very model of a jolly-good bookseller, charming and arch, with a tome for everything. But he's also a nosy parker and recreational sleuth. Book carries a \"letter from Churchill\" in his breast pocket, which hints at covert wartime gallantry but, crucially, gives him carte blanche to insert himself into any investigation that tickles his fancy. Each mystery is spread over two episodes, but the real joy isn't in solving anything - it's in hanging out with the characters. Polly Walker is a delight as Book's wife, Trottie, and their backstory (which I won't spoil) adds a moving layer to all the detective work. Warm, whimsical and stuffed with cracking wallpaper, these six episodes are the perfect wintry binge.</p><p>Chief of War Apple TV+ from Friday If you're still searching for your next big epic history drama post-Shogun, this'll do nicely. Jason Momoa, never less than mythically jacked, stars as Ka'iana, a shark-wrangling warrior drawn back into battle amid a looming war to unify the Hawaiian islands. Set in the late 1700s, when the islands were fractured into rival chiefdoms and Western influence loomed, the series follows the rise of King Kamehameha (a stately Kaina Makua), who dreams of uniting Hawaii, Maui, O'ahu and Kaua'i under one rule. This is a passion project from Momoa and co-creator Thomas Pa'a Sibbett, both of Native Hawaiian descent, told from an indigenous perspective with dialogue in the Polynesian language. Expect bloodcurdling battles, snazzy spearwork, and towering performances from New Zealand's finest: Temuera Morrison and Cliff Curtis.</p><p>Wednesday Season 2 premieres on Netflix, August 8 The ookiest, spookiest Netflix hit Wednesday returns next week, with four episodes in part one. If you skipped the first season on the grounds it was \"for kids\", I implore you to reconsider. This Addams Family riff is the best thing Tim Burton's made in yonks. Heavy is the head that wears Christina Ricci's goth girl crown, but Jenna Ortega more than earned her keep as the exquisitely affectless Wednesday. This season, we're back at Nevermore Academy with a new headmaster: the suspiciously wholesome Barry Dort, played by Steve Buscemi, whose very casting screams \"definitely hiding something\". Also crashing the crypt: Joanna Lumley as Morticia's mother and Billie Piper. And yes, Lady Gaga is coming - but you'll have to wait until Part Two drops in September for that particular seance.</p><p>Landscapers Stan The internet's current boyfriend is, without a doubt, Will Sharpe - thanks to his lethally charismatic turn in Lena Dunham's Too Much. But did you know he's also a director? And not just any director, but a properly odd, properly brilliant one. Landscapers, his 2021 true-crime drama series, stars David Thewlis and Olivia Colman (if that casting alone doesn't convince you, what will?) as Susan and Christopher Edwards, an awkward, soft-spoken couple with a shared love of Westerns, old Hollywood and Gerard Depardieu. They are also murderers. In 1998, the couple shot Susan's elderly parents and buried them in their suburban Mansfield back garden - a crime that went unnoticed for over a decade. It sounds like typical true-crime dross, but in Sharpe's hands, it isn't. He steers it gleefully off-road; what emerges is less a whodunit and more a portrait of two people who built a fantasy world held together by love, denial and VHS tapes. Colman is extraordinary (obviously), and Thewlis matches her beat for beat. A true-crime drama that refuses to play by the genre's rules - weird, elegant, and unlike anything else on TV. I've been thinking about it for years.</p><p>Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time Netflix Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, this deeply upsetting five-part documentary revisits the disaster and the man-made failures that turned it into a national disgrace. Told through the eyes of survivors, organisers and officials, it lays out how environmental negligence, systemic racism and political inertia collided to produce something far worse than a natural catastrophe. There are wrenching testimonies and shocking footage, with an undercurrent of fury and sorrow. Created by Traci A. Curry, this is a measured, dignified piece of filmmaking - a human-centred account of a government that failed its citizens. Essential viewing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-820ca00c6cde11f090863571e9705a1700398912a72daa82ea6d5d312fb0b055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD2-H363-RTV1-B29Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 2, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

These initiatives focus on educating and counseling patients through team-based care, while also addressing Social Determinants of Health that impact patient outcomes.</p><p>Recipients of the 2025 BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care award are:</p><p>Community Health and Social Services Center (Detroit, MI) will broaden its medication management service for individuals with Type 2 diabetes to include screening for peripheral artery disease and peripheral neuropathy. The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley. Frontera Healthcare Network - $50,000 to cover healthcare costs for flood survivors, provide mental health and other wraparound services to first responders, and give emergency cash assistance to health center staff experiencing serious financial impacts, enabling them to continue their work.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000. The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.</p><p>Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Direct Relief Foundation Beyond ABCs: School-Based Health Centers Provide Care for Students</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 04: Direct Relief Foundation For Children in Ukraine, Medical Transport Covers Last Mile to Care</p><p>When war broke out in February 2022, German paramedic Marc Friedrich was in disbelief.</p><p>\"We had imagined that there would be no more war in Europe, and then suddenly Russia attacked,\" he recalled.</p><p>That disbelief soon gave way to determination.</p><p>On March 9, an airstrike struck Mariupol's Maternity Hospital No. 3, killing four people and injuring at least 16 others.</p><p>\"That was a trigger moment for me,\" said Friedrich, who left his role as emergency services paramedic chief near Dusseldorf to establish a dedicated ambulance service for children in Ukraine.</p><p>\"I wanted to configure an ambulance specially to the needs of children, where the equipment doesn't have to be specially prepared for them but is rather the standard,\" said Friedrich, founder of Ambulance for Kids. Such emergency service vehicles are very rare in both Germany and Ukraine, Friedrich notes.</p><p>Acquiring an ambulance and equipping it for pediatric care cost at least $350,000. With support from a range of partners, the NGO began operating on the ground in July 2023. Direct Relief joined in 2025 with a grant to help sustain operations.</p><p>The final touch was the interior decor. \"We conducted an action in Western Ukraine with a local artist to get the inside painted by children for children, so that it looks beautiful for patients, not just white,\" said Friedrich.</p><p>August 01: Direct Relief FoundationMedical Aid for Myanmar, 18 Other Countries, Departs This Week</p><p>Over the past week, Direct Relief has delivered 580 shipments of requested medical aid to 47 U.S. states and territories and 19 countries worldwide. The shipments contained 6.3 million defined daily doses of medication.</p><p>Medications and supplies shipped this week include rare disease therapies, diabetes management medications, pharmaceutical-grade refrigeration units, surgical supplies, field medic packs for first responders, and more.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 31: Direct Relief FoundationEquipping Midwives for Success and Transforming Maternal Health in Nigeria</p><p>Dr. Faith Adole, founder of the U-VOL Foundation, is revolutionizing maternal and neonatal healthcare in rural Nigeria through the Value Her initiative. The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise. In the United States, Direct Relief is in communication with the Hawai\u02bb i Primary Care Association and the Hawai\u02bb i Department of Health to assess potential medical needs and ensure readiness to support affected communities. Direct Relief is also in communication with the Northwest Regional Primary Care Association, which includes Alaska health centers.</p><p>In Japan, the organization is coordinating with Peace Winds Japan, a non-governmental disaster response organization, to evaluate needs on the ground and offer emergency medical supplies and support.</p><p>In the South Pacific, Direct Relief is coordinating with the Pacific Community, formerly the South Pacific Commission, as well as the Pacific Island Health Officers Association.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes. For many, the emotional debris of the disaster lingers on.</p><p>\"Most people will get to the other side of this,\" said Sheila Thornton, Clinical Director at Foothill Family, a nonprofit mental health organization serving the San Gabriel Valley. \"But you don't forget it. You'll take pieces of it that you keep with you always.\"</p><p>Thornton, who joined Foothill Family in 1985 as a contract social worker, responded to her first major after the October 1993 Altadena wildfires. Three months later, Los Angeles was hit by the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake, which killed at least 57 people.</p><p>In the aftermath, Foothill Family received a FEMA grant to study the mental health impact of those events and developed expertise in trauma long before trauma-informed care became common practice.</p><p>\"Experiencing a traumatic event impacts you physically, emotionally, behaviorally, and cognitively,\" Thornton said. \"You can't sleep, you snap at people, you can't focus or make decisions.\"</p><p>July 28: Direct Relief Foundation The Solidarity Foundation of the Divine Child Jesus and Direct Relief Inaugurate a Modern Solidarity Collection Center in Santiago de los Caballeros</p><p>Fundacion Solidaria del Divino NiNo Jesus, Inc. and Direct Relief, a leading global humanitarian organization in emergency medical assistance, celebrated the inauguration and blessing of the Divino NiNo Solidarity Collection Center, a state-of-the-art logistics facility that will optimize the distribution of medicines, medical equipment, and health supplies to vulnerable communities throughout the region.</p><p>The new center, which has three levels, will serve as a fundamental logistical hub to strengthen the social and charitable actions of both the Foundation and the Archdiocese of Santiago de los Caballeros. From this space, donations of medicines, medical equipment, emergency kits, expendable materials and other essential supplies that will impact thousands of people will be channeled through institutions such as the National Health Service in the Cibao Norte region, religious communities, hospices, Caritas and social pastoral programs.

The 70-minute set also delves into Maron's intrusive catastrophic thinking and the cognitive decline of his father, both of which he makes sound much funnier than one would believe possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc81nl6wi173tq8ul44ys</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBV-5TF3-S3J8-83JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun Herald (Sydney, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-05062504235537890001104881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYS-DCB3-RS2M-X4CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"214\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Mr Hulls will become Life360's executive chairman, having led the company for almost two decades.</p><p>\"I really feel like we're just getting started,\" Ms Antonoff told The Australian from San Francisco. \"We're still building that base of users.</p><p>\"Life360 is an incredibly important mission. As a mum, I know how important that peace of mind is, and so to lead a company with a compelling mission and a great business is the opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>\"I like to tell my friends that I didn't come to a smaller company. I came to a big company that's just earlier in its journey.\" Life360 logged 88 million monthly active users, a 25 per cent rise year on year, reporting its second-quarter results on Tuesday. The company added 136,000 new paying customers, to 2.5 million.</p><p>Quarterly revenue jumped 36 per cent year on year to $US115.4m ($176.9m) as annualised revenue rose 36 per cent, to $US416.1m. The $6.5bn company also lifted full-year guidance, forecasting revenue of between $US462m and $US482m (up from between $US450m and $US480m) and adjusted EBITDA of between $US72m and $US82m (up from between $US65m and $US75m).</p><p>Local shares of the Nasdaq- and ASX-listed company were up 8.9 per cent to $41.20.</p><p>Citi analysts, led by Siraj Ahmed, were positive on the result, affirming a \"buy\" rating and a $90 target price. User growth and a 35 per cent rise in annual revenue per paying customer were reasons for optimism, the broker said.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical.

This leads to a massacre at a wedding in the village, and some very awkward conversations between the pair.</p><p>Edward had no idea his mother was a trained killer and now he's got to go on the run with her.</p><p>The duo are played by Freddie Highmore (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Doctor</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bates Motel</emphasis>) and Keeley Hawes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bodyguard</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Line of Duty</emphasis>), each straddling the line between drama and dark comedy.</p><p>While Hawes owns the role and brings a great energy, Highmore seems a little out of his depth and never quite matches his co-star's tone.</p><p>The six-episode series is a British-Australian co-production with action taking place all over Europe.</p><p>There's conspiracies, blackmail, pursuits, you name it. But as the series progresses you find yourself increasingly wondering if <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Assassin</emphasis> knows where it's going. It teases so many different story threads that you'd hope would have a solid payoff, but ultimately just fizzle out.</p><p>By the time the finale rolls around, it seems that teenagers have taken over the writing tasks because this train goes completely off the rails.</p><p>You might be tempted to finish the show just to solve the mysteries, but <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Assassin</emphasis> is really not worth the trouble.</p><p>That said, Aussie Devon Terrell (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Totally Completely Fine</emphasis>) gives a spirited performance as the shallow, drug-taking son of an Aussie billionaire played by Alan Dale.</p><p>WASHINGTON BLACK</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Disney+</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Based on the novel by Esi Edugyan, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Black</emphasis> is a historical fiction series, following the titular George Washington Black across two timelines.</p><p>In one, the young 'Wash' as he's known is a slave on a plantation in Barbados, looked after by another enslaved person with no knowledge of his birth family. The brother of the English slave-owner rolls into town in a fancy steam-powered vehicle - a shocking sight in the 1800s - and takes an interest in young Wash's astute mind. The pair end up setting out on an adventure together, but the dynamic is always awkward being that Wash is technically still owned by this man's family.</p><p>The second timeline sees a now older Wash going by the name 'Jack Crawford'  and living in Nova Scotia, Canada, in a city at the end of the famous Underground Railroad. He meets an English woman with mixed ancestry and is immediately taken with her, despite their differences in circumstances.</p><p>The show is sprawling and beautifully costumed, but the reliance on CGI and weirdly juvenile storytelling is a drawback.</p><p>CRITICAL: BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Netflix</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>In the grand tradition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">RPA </emphasis>or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">24 Hours in A&amp;E</emphasis>, Netflix's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Critical: Between Life and Death</emphasis>, takes viewers behind the scenes of series medical emergencies.</p><p>Set in London, the docuseries focuses on significant trauma cases, and the paramedics, dispatchers, helicopter pilots, doctors, surgeons, nurses and coordinators who make these cases run as smoothly as possible.</p><p>What's remarkable is how calmly and quietly these medical professionals go about their jobs - a far cry from the chaos people who religiously watched <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ER </emphasis>would come to expect from such occasions.</p><p>The show also catches up with the people and their families involved in the accidents and incidents that led them to needing serious medical attention.</p><p>ALSO STREAMING</p><p>There's plenty of documentary action to be found on your streaming services this week. On Stan you'll find <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Accidental President</emphasis>, a fascinating feature documentary about the remarkable story of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who challenged the Belarusian dictator by running for president against him. Disney+ has a docuseries from producer Ryan Coogler (known for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Panther</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sinners</emphasis>) called <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time</emphasis>, looking back at the devastating natural disaster of 2005 in New Orleans. Also on Disney+ is a true crime docuseries, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Her Last Broadcast: The Abduction of Jodi Huisentruit</emphasis>. Over on Prime Video you'll find another season of docuseries <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shiny Happy People</emphasis>, this time focusing on Teen Mania, an evangelical Christian youth organisation out of Texas. While Netflix has some happier documentary fare with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hitmakers</emphasis>, a series focusing on the songwriters and producers behind some of the world's biggest musical artists. There's also, of course, Netflix's huge film release of recent times: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Happy Gilmore 2</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/Fd5uVpbrX8JfWMnDvsnePi/a4633abe-231e-427b-b4e9-12b99a5ca240.png\">Freddie Highmore and Keeley Hawes in The Assassin.

As temperatures rise, the heart pumps faster to move blood toward the skin to cool the body. This added strain on the cardiovascular system can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, especially for those with existing heart conditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The danger can spike dramatically when combined with high humidity, according to a new study from Tulane University that found the risk of visiting the emergency room for a heart-related issue is six times higher during extremely hot and humid days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study, published in Science of the Total Environment, analyzed more than 340,000 emergency room visits for heart-related issues in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city characterized by intense heat and humidity, from 2014 to 2019. Researchers modeled these visits against historical temperature and humidity data. While heat alone increased the risk of a heart-related emergency by 4.4% on low-humidity days, the risk jumped to 26.7% on the most humid days when relative humidity topped 82 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 24: Is the nose key to preventing pneumonia?

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical.

As temperatures rise, the heart pumps faster to move blood toward the skin to cool the body. This added strain on the cardiovascular system can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, especially for those with existing heart conditions.</p><p>The danger can spike dramatically when combined with high humidity, according to a new study from Tulane University that found the risk of visiting the emergency room for a heart-related issue is six times higher during extremely hot and humid days.</p><p>The study, published in Science of the Total Environment, analyzed more than 340,000 emergency room visits for heart-related issues in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city characterized by intense heat and humidity, from 2014 to 2019. Researchers modeled these visits against historical temperature and humidity data. While heat alone increased the risk of a heart-related emergency by 4.4% on low-humidity days, the risk jumped to 26.7% on the most humid days when relative humidity topped 82 percent.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Tulane University: A single shot at birth may shield children from HIV for years, study finds</p><p>A new study in Nature shows that delivering a single injection of gene therapy at birth may offer years-long protection against HIV, taking advantage of a critical window in early life that could reshape the fight against pediatric infections in high-risk regions.</p><p>This study is among the first to show that the first weeks of life, when the immune system is naturally more tolerant, may be the optimal window for delivering gene therapies that would otherwise be rejected at older ages.</p><p>\"Nearly 300 children are infected with HIV each day,\" said first author Amir Ardeshir, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane National Primate Research Center, who conducted the study alongside fellow researchers at the California National Primate Research Center. \"This approach could help protect newborns in high-risk areas during the most vulnerable period of their lives.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 29: Ancient Maya population may have topped 16 million, Tulane research shows</p><p>New research led by Tulane University archaeologists reveals that the ancient Maya civilization was far more populous than previously thought - supporting as many as 16 million people across parts of modern-day Guatemala, southern Mexico and western Belize.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 18: Tulane University: An FDA-backed metric used to determine effectiveness of rectal cancer drugs may be unreliable, says new study</p><p>A new study by a Tulane University researcher casts doubt on a widely used shortcut in rectal cancer drug trials, raising concerns that some treatments may be fast-tracked for approval without evidence they help patients live longer.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 08: Tulane University: New drug targets 'zombie cells' in effort to prevent liver disease, cancer</p><p>A new drug candidate developed by Tulane University researchers may work to prevent a common type of fatty liver disease.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical. The reason? People feel more empathy toward small businesses and are more inclined to support them with better reviews.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 23: Tulane University: Study shows how El Nino and La Nibna climate swings threaten mangroves worldwide</p><p>A new international study led by researchers at Tulane University shows that the El NiNo and La NiNa climate patterns affect nearly half of the world's mangrove forests, underscoring the vulnerability of these vital coastal ecosystems to climatic shifts.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical. The reason? People feel more empathy toward small businesses and are more inclined to support them with better reviews.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 23: Tulane University: Study shows how El Nino and La Nibna climate swings threaten mangroves worldwide</p><p>A new international study led by researchers at Tulane University shows that the El NiNo and La NiNa climate patterns affect nearly half of the world's mangrove forests, underscoring the vulnerability of these vital coastal ecosystems to climatic shifts.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical. The reason?

The finger was in formaldehyde, or something, so it was pretty well preserved,\" he said.</p><p>Barrow does. She was poking around for stories on a quiet Sunday shift and walked into the Bendigo Police Station.</p><p>\"I think from memory it might have been a detective by the name of Tom Harper - I can't remember exactly - and he said 'we've got a jar with a finger in it',\" Barrow said.</p><p>It was actually the top of two fingertips, we can confirm after Amor's dad, Neil (also a former <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertiser</emphasis> worker), recently dropped by the office with a copy of one of the stories.</p><p>\"I've kept a bit of Mike's stuff, though Mike kept that bit [the copy of the 'fingers' story],\" Neil said.</p><p>The strips of newspaper columns include a picture of the fingertips.</p><p>It is gross. There are fingernails. Bits of skin look like they are about to drop off.</p><p>Police officers appear to have taken them out of the jar of what the story describes as methylated spirits for the photo.</p><p>\"The police were initially a bit concerned that they [the fingers] might have come off a human, in some sort of nasty way,\" Barrow said.</p><p>\"As it turned out, it still was nasty, but not malicious.\"</p><p>What Barrow knew for certain as she walked back to the newsroom was that the fingertips had been found in a shed, presumably while someone was cleaning it out.</p><p>The story was published in the next edition, but Barrow recalled it took a few days for someone to come forward and claim the fingertips. </p><p>Police officer acting Inspector Graham Aitken told Amor someone had walked into the police station and said \"I heard you've got my fingers\".</p><p>\"Apparently it all stemmed from an accident about 23 years ago, when a man had his fingers sheared clean off while towing a truck,\" the cop told Amor.</p><p>The man had staggered into a nearby garage and the boss had rushed him to get medical help.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the workers followed the trail of blood back up the road, put the fingers in a matchbox and took them home.</p><p>Amor cannot recall how the newspaper tracked that former mechanic shop worker, Michael Ellis, down, though his dad remembers him being a staff member at some point.</p><p>In any event, Ellis loved a good story and relished a chance to share this one.</p><p>\"I was only about 14 and I guess it was just intrigue which led me to find them,\" he told the younger Amor.</p><p>\"I showed them to all the kids. They didn't believe they were real, especially the girls - they were a bit put off.\"</p><p>Ellis soon preserved the fingers in a vegemite jar full of methylated spirits. Then, more than a decade later, someone broke into his house and stole them. He thought he would never see them again.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertiser's</emphasis> subeditors were overjoyed when Mike handed them his story.</p><p>They immediately started coming up with puns like \"a touching reunion\" that they wanted in print, Barrow said.</p><p>The copy of the story this journalist has seen went with the far less exciting but more straightforward \"Fingers riddle solved\".</p><p>Barrow and Amor went on to receive the \"The Golden Brumby\" trophy from that year's Bendigo Press Club awards. Linda is no longer a journalist but still calls Bendigo home and has plenty more ripper stories from her time at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Addy</emphasis>.</p><p>Amor became <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">7 News'</emphasis> US <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/5131357/mike-amor-trades-trump-stories-for-christmas-back-home/\"> bureau chief </url>, covering events like September 11, Hurricane Katrina and the rise of multiple presidents. His newly released autobiography <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/9023371/mike-amor-book-shows-foreign-correspondent-from-bendigo/\"> has plenty of stories </url> about those moments, along with a few from his days at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertiser</emphasis>.</p><p>\"[The fingers story] was one of the more unusual ones I have covered,\" Amor said.</p><p>Alas, Ellis did not get his treasured fingers back.</p><p>Police destroyed them. The story vanished from the headlines and into local journalist folklore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/Tom.OCallaghan/b4131b9c-fa3a-4b31-8c1e-ab48297bb709.jpg\">Linda Barrow with the award she and Mike Amor won in 1990 for their coverage of Bendigo's 'disappearing double digits'.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical. The reason? People feel more empathy toward small businesses and are more inclined to support them with better reviews.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 23: Tulane University: Study shows how El Nino and La Nibna climate swings threaten mangroves worldwide</p><p>A new international study led by researchers at Tulane University shows that the El NiNo and La NiNa climate patterns affect nearly half of the world's mangrove forests, underscoring the vulnerability of these vital coastal ecosystems to climatic shifts.

The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions.

More than 35% of the organizations said lack of reliable power is an ongoing concern in their area, with nearly one in five (20%) saying they lose power at least once per quarter. Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms also bring down power lines, while periods of excessive heat often lead to intermittent localized outages.</p><p>Three organizations, including Palmetto Health Council in Palmetto, Ga., report losing power at least once per month. (Two of Palmetto's eight clinic locations lost power when Hurricane Helene struck, one of them for 36 hours).</p><p>Volunteers In Medicine in Hilton Head Island, SC, which had intermittent power outages for two days after Hurricane Helene, also experiences outages during heavy thunderstorms. There is no natural gas supply to the island. The clinic has a gasoline-powered generator that can be manually connected to keep the pharmaceutical refrigerators running, with a tank that has enough fuel to run for about two days.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 18: Direct Relief Foundation Lights Out - Intro: The Scope and Impact of Storm-Driven Power Loss on Safety-Net Clinics</p><p>Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton devastated the southeastern United States in late September and early October 2024, killing more than 250 people and causing an estimated $113 billion in damages. But beyond the immediate destruction lay another crisis: widespread power outages that forced healthcare safety-net providers to close their doors when vulnerable patients needed them most.</p><p>Direct Relief surveyed federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and free &amp; charitable clinics across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to understand how power loss from natural disasters disrupts healthcare for the nation's most vulnerable populations.

Forecasts indicate further strengthening over the weekend, with the potential to reach major Category 4 status. Current models show Erin passing north of Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands, bringing dangerous swells, rip currents, and squally conditions to parts of the northern Caribbean.

Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise.

Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms also bring down power lines, while periods of excessive heat often lead to intermittent localized outages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three organizations, including Palmetto Health Council in Palmetto, Ga., report losing power at least once per month. (Two of Palmetto's eight clinic locations lost power when Hurricane Helene struck, one of them for 36 hours).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Volunteers In Medicine in Hilton Head Island, SC, which had intermittent power outages for two days after Hurricane Helene, also experiences outages during heavy thunderstorms. There is no natural gas supply to the island.

But beyond the immediate destruction lay another crisis: widespread power outages that forced healthcare safety-net providers to close their doors when vulnerable patients needed them most.</p><p>Direct Relief surveyed federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and free &amp; charitable clinics across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to understand how power loss from natural disasters disrupts healthcare for the nation's most vulnerable populations. This three-part report reveals the hidden health consequences of climate disasters-and the urgent need for resilient healthcare infrastructure.</p><p>Top findings among 80 survey respondents Power outages forced the closure of one or more clinical sites at 54% of responding healthcare safety-net organizations (FQHCs or free &amp; charitable clinics)*</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 18: Direct Relief Foundation Lights Out: Part I - How Power Loss From Helene and Milton Disrupted Care for Thousands Across Southeast</p><p>When Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton barreled across Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina one after the other in late September and early October 2024, they caused widespread electrical power outages that forced temporary closures at more than half of safety-net healthcare providers responding to a survey conducted by Direct Relief.</p><p>Among 80 community health centers and free &amp; charitable clinics responding to the survey, 43 (54%) said power loss forced the temporary closure of at least one clinic site.</p><p>The power outages led to nearly 28,000 canceled or delayed patient visits, an outcome tied to negative health outcomes including higher mortality. Nearly one-fourth (19) of the providers were forced to discard temperature-sensitive medicine or vaccines when their refrigerators lost power. Twenty-three organizations reported losing revenue totaling $12.9 million while they were closed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 14: Direct Relief Monitors Hurricane Erin, Medical Support Departs to 12 Countries</p><p>Over the past week, Direct Relief has shipped 592 shipments of requested medical aid to 48 U.S. states and territories and 12 countries worldwide.

Forecasts indicate further strengthening over the weekend, with the potential to reach major Category 4 status. Current models show Erin passing north of Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands, bringing dangerous swells, rip currents, and squally conditions to parts of the northern Caribbean.

The hub's architects say the platform, which can be found on ICM's website here, is structured to be intuitive and user-friendly for anyone who wants a deep dive into global maternal and infant health outcomes. Data scientists say they hope the public data can be used to help medical professionals advocate for better outcomes globally.</p><p>\"When you see the data, when you see the country comparison, you can't un-see it,\" said Jessica White, who worked as the Global Midwives' Data Hub Lead for ICM. \"And I think when you know better, you do better.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.' Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise.

The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley. Frontera Healthcare Network - $50,000 to cover healthcare costs for flood survivors, provide mental health and other wraparound services to first responders, and give emergency cash assistance to health center staff experiencing serious financial impacts, enabling them to continue their work.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 18: Direct Relief Foundation Lights Out: Part II - Power Reliability and Backup Power at Safety Net Clinics</p><p>Notably, hurricanes aren't the only cause of power loss for these safety-net clinics. More than 35% of the organizations said lack of reliable power is an ongoing concern in their area, with nearly one in five (20%) saying they lose power at least once per quarter. Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms also bring down power lines, while periods of excessive heat often lead to intermittent localized outages.</p><p>Three organizations, including Palmetto Health Council in Palmetto, Ga., report losing power at least once per month. (Two of Palmetto's eight clinic locations lost power when Hurricane Helene struck, one of them for 36 hours).</p><p>Volunteers In Medicine in Hilton Head Island, SC, which had intermittent power outages for two days after Hurricane Helene, also experiences outages during heavy thunderstorms. There is no natural gas supply to the island. The clinic has a gasoline-powered generator that can be manually connected to keep the pharmaceutical refrigerators running, with a tank that has enough fuel to run for about two days.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 18: Direct Relief Foundation Lights Out: Part I - How Power Loss From Helene and Milton Disrupted Care for Thousands Across Southeast</p><p>When Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton barreled across Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina one after the other in late September and early October 2024, they caused widespread electrical power outages that forced temporary closures at more than half of safety-net healthcare providers responding to a survey conducted by Direct Relief.</p><p>Among 80 community health centers and free &amp; charitable clinics responding to the survey, 43 (54%) said power loss forced the temporary closure of at least one clinic site.</p><p>The power outages led to nearly 28,000 canceled or delayed patient visits, an outcome tied to negative health outcomes including higher mortality. Nearly one-fourth (19) of the providers were forced to discard temperature-sensitive medicine or vaccines when their refrigerators lost power. Twenty-three organizations reported losing revenue totaling $12.9 million while they were closed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 14: Direct Relief Monitors Hurricane Erin, Medical Support Departs to 12 Countries</p><p>Over the past week, Direct Relief has shipped 592 shipments of requested medical aid to 48 U.S. states and territories and 12 countries worldwide. The shipments contained 7.1 million defined daily doses of medication.</p><p>Medications and supplies shipped this week included cancer treatments, rare disease therapies, diabetes management medications, pharmaceutical-grade refrigeration units, surgical supplies, field medic packs for first responders, and more.</p><p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season. Forecasts indicate further strengthening over the weekend, with the potential to reach major Category 4 status. Current models show Erin passing north of Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands, bringing dangerous swells, rip currents, and squally conditions to parts of the northern Caribbean. While a direct U.S. landfall remains uncertain, forecasters continue to monitor for potential track shifts toward the East Coast or Bermuda in the coming week.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 14: Direct Relief Foundation Hope and Health: Three Inspirational Women Changing the Future of Healthcare in Ghana</p><p>I've just returned from an extraordinary trip to Ghana and Uganda, and while I'll share more in the weeks ahead, I wanted to begin with the first part of the journey - Ghana. Seeing our work firsthand was both humbling and inspiring. Nothing compares.</p><p>Meeting so many dedicated people and organizations committed to improving health and lives makes it impossible to leave without a deep sense of hope - and an even stronger commitment to humanitarian work. Over the course of just a few days, I had the privilege of meeting three remarkable women whose lives are dedicated to creating lasting change.</p><p>In Accra, we met with Elizabeth Esi Denyo, President of the Ghana Diabetes Association, and toured a clinic participating in the Life for a Child program - a partnership between Direct Relief, Eli Lilly, and the Ghana Diabetes Association to provide free insulin to children and young adults living with Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 13: Direct Relief Foundation How Do Countries Compare in Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes Updated Data Hub Has the Answers</p><p>Looking globally at the health outcomes of women and babies and comparing those rates across time could be a daunting task for any researcher, but a newly revamped data hub aims to bring that information together - and provide insights about the path forward.</p><p>The International Confederation of Midwives, or ICM, a non-governmental global advocacy group representing more than 1 million midwives globally, relaunched a digital data hub in July 2025. The hub's architects say the platform, which can be found on ICM's website here, is structured to be intuitive and user-friendly for anyone who wants a deep dive into global maternal and infant health outcomes. Data scientists say they hope the public data can be used to help medical professionals advocate for better outcomes globally.</p><p>\"When you see the data, when you see the country comparison, you can't un-see it,\" said Jessica White, who worked as the Global Midwives' Data Hub Lead for ICM. \"And I think when you know better, you do better.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.' Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000. The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.</p><p>Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Direct Relief Foundation Beyond ABCs: School-Based Health Centers Provide Care for Students</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 04: Direct Relief Foundation For Children in Ukraine, Medical Transport Covers Last Mile to Care</p><p>When war broke out in February 2022, German paramedic Marc Friedrich was in disbelief.</p><p>\"We had imagined that there would be no more war in Europe, and then suddenly Russia attacked,\" he recalled.</p><p>That disbelief soon gave way to determination.</p><p>On March 9, an airstrike struck Mariupol's Maternity Hospital No. 3, killing four people and injuring at least 16 others.</p><p>\"That was a trigger moment for me,\" said Friedrich, who left his role as emergency services paramedic chief near Dusseldorf to establish a dedicated ambulance service for children in Ukraine.</p><p>\"I wanted to configure an ambulance specially to the needs of children, where the equipment doesn't have to be specially prepared for them but is rather the standard,\" said Friedrich, founder of Ambulance for Kids. Such emergency service vehicles are very rare in both Germany and Ukraine, Friedrich notes.</p><p>Acquiring an ambulance and equipping it for pediatric care cost at least $350,000. With support from a range of partners, the NGO began operating on the ground in July 2023. Direct Relief joined in 2025 with a grant to help sustain operations.</p><p>The final touch was the interior decor. \"We conducted an action in Western Ukraine with a local artist to get the inside painted by children for children, so that it looks beautiful for patients, not just white,\" said Friedrich.</p><p>August 01: Direct Relief FoundationMedical Aid for Myanmar, 18 Other Countries, Departs This Week</p><p>Over the past week, Direct Relief has delivered 580 shipments of requested medical aid to 47 U.S. states and territories and 19 countries worldwide.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise. In the United States, Direct Relief is in communication with the Hawai\u02bb i Primary Care Association and the Hawai\u02bb i Department of Health to assess potential medical needs and ensure readiness to support affected communities. Direct Relief is also in communication with the Northwest Regional Primary Care Association, which includes Alaska health centers.</p><p>In Japan, the organization is coordinating with Peace Winds Japan, a non-governmental disaster response organization, to evaluate needs on the ground and offer emergency medical supplies and support.</p><p>In the South Pacific, Direct Relief is coordinating with the Pacific Community, formerly the South Pacific Commission, as well as the Pacific Island Health Officers Association.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes. For many, the emotional debris of the disaster lingers on.</p><p>\"Most people will get to the other side of this,\" said Sheila Thornton, Clinical Director at Foothill Family, a nonprofit mental health organization serving the San Gabriel Valley. \"But you don't forget it. You'll take pieces of it that you keep with you always.\"</p><p>Thornton, who joined Foothill Family in 1985 as a contract social worker, responded to her first major after the October 1993 Altadena wildfires. Three months later, Los Angeles was hit by the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake, which killed at least 57 people.</p><p>In the aftermath, Foothill Family received a FEMA grant to study the mental health impact of those events and developed expertise in trauma long before trauma-informed care became common practice.</p><p>\"Experiencing a traumatic event impacts you physically, emotionally, behaviorally, and cognitively,\" Thornton said. \"You can't sleep, you snap at people, you can't focus or make decisions.\"</p><p>PermID: 5053501335</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-19082518220937890001108496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHX-JG03-RTGB-93MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

These initiatives focus on educating and counseling patients through team-based care, while also addressing Social Determinants of Health that impact patient outcomes.</p><p>Recipients of the 2025 BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care award are:</p><p>Community Health and Social Services Center (Detroit, MI) will broaden its medication management service for individuals with Type 2 diabetes to include screening for peripheral artery disease and peripheral neuropathy. The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley. Frontera Healthcare Network - $50,000 to cover healthcare costs for flood survivors, provide mental health and other wraparound services to first responders, and give emergency cash assistance to health center staff experiencing serious financial impacts, enabling them to continue their work.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 18: Direct Relief Foundation Lights Out: Part II - Power Reliability and Backup Power at Safety Net Clinics</p><p>Notably, hurricanes aren't the only cause of power loss for these safety-net clinics. More than 35% of the organizations said lack of reliable power is an ongoing concern in their area, with nearly one in five (20%) saying they lose power at least once per quarter. Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms also bring down power lines, while periods of excessive heat often lead to intermittent localized outages.</p><p>Three organizations, including Palmetto Health Council in Palmetto, Ga., report losing power at least once per month. (Two of Palmetto's eight clinic locations lost power when Hurricane Helene struck, one of them for 36 hours).</p><p>Volunteers In Medicine in Hilton Head Island, SC, which had intermittent power outages for two days after Hurricane Helene, also experiences outages during heavy thunderstorms. There is no natural gas supply to the island.

Nearly one-fourth (19) of the providers were forced to discard temperature-sensitive medicine or vaccines when their refrigerators lost power.

His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations.

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians.

The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities.

The shipments contained 7.1 million defined daily doses of medication.</p><p>Medications and supplies shipped this week included cancer treatments, rare disease therapies, diabetes management medications, pharmaceutical-grade refrigeration units, surgical supplies, field medic packs for first responders, and more.</p><p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season. Forecasts indicate further strengthening over the weekend, with the potential to reach major Category 4 status. Current models show Erin passing north of Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands, bringing dangerous swells, rip currents, and squally conditions to parts of the northern Caribbean. While a direct U.S. landfall remains uncertain, forecasters continue to monitor for potential track shifts toward the East Coast or Bermuda in the coming week.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 13: Direct Relief Foundation How Do Countries Compare in Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes Updated Data Hub Has the Answers</p><p>Looking globally at the health outcomes of women and babies and comparing those rates across time could be a daunting task for any researcher, but a newly revamped data hub aims to bring that information together - and provide insights about the path forward.</p><p>The International Confederation of Midwives, or ICM, a non-governmental global advocacy group representing more than 1 million midwives globally, relaunched a digital data hub in July 2025. The hub's architects say the platform, which can be found on ICM's website here, is structured to be intuitive and user-friendly for anyone who wants a deep dive into global maternal and infant health outcomes. Data scientists say they hope the public data can be used to help medical professionals advocate for better outcomes globally.</p><p>\"When you see the data, when you see the country comparison, you can't un-see it,\" said Jessica White, who worked as the Global Midwives' Data Hub Lead for ICM. \"And I think when you know better, you do better.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.'

His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes.

These initiatives focus on educating and counseling patients through team-based care, while also addressing Social Determinants of Health that impact patient outcomes.</p><p>Recipients of the 2025 BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care award are:</p><p>Community Health and Social Services Center (Detroit, MI) will broaden its medication management service for individuals with Type 2 diabetes to include screening for peripheral artery disease and peripheral neuropathy. The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley.

Nothing compares.</p><p>Meeting so many dedicated people and organizations committed to improving health and lives makes it impossible to leave without a deep sense of hope - and an even stronger commitment to humanitarian work. Over the course of just a few days, I had the privilege of meeting three remarkable women whose lives are dedicated to creating lasting change.</p><p>In Accra, we met with Elizabeth Esi Denyo, President of the Ghana Diabetes Association, and toured a clinic participating in the Life for a Child program - a partnership between Direct Relief, Eli Lilly, and the Ghana Diabetes Association to provide free insulin to children and young adults living with Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 13: Direct Relief Foundation How Do Countries Compare in Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes Updated Data Hub Has the Answers</p><p>Looking globally at the health outcomes of women and babies and comparing those rates across time could be a daunting task for any researcher, but a newly revamped data hub aims to bring that information together - and provide insights about the path forward.</p><p>The International Confederation of Midwives, or ICM, a non-governmental global advocacy group representing more than 1 million midwives globally, relaunched a digital data hub in July 2025. The hub's architects say the platform, which can be found on ICM's website here, is structured to be intuitive and user-friendly for anyone who wants a deep dive into global maternal and infant health outcomes. Data scientists say they hope the public data can be used to help medical professionals advocate for better outcomes globally.</p><p>\"When you see the data, when you see the country comparison, you can't un-see it,\" said Jessica White, who worked as the Global Midwives' Data Hub Lead for ICM. \"And I think when you know better, you do better.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.' Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session.

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes.

These initiatives focus on educating and counseling patients through team-based care, while also addressing Social Determinants of Health that impact patient outcomes.</p><p>Recipients of the 2025 BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care award are:</p><p>Community Health and Social Services Center (Detroit, MI) will broaden its medication management service for individuals with Type 2 diabetes to include screening for peripheral artery disease and peripheral neuropathy. The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley. Frontera Healthcare Network - $50,000 to cover healthcare costs for flood survivors, provide mental health and other wraparound services to first responders, and give emergency cash assistance to health center staff experiencing serious financial impacts, enabling them to continue their work.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.' Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000.

If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes.

His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 DIRECT RELIEF FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Name</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Designation</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Thomas Tighe,</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">CEO &amp; President</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jonathan Steiner</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">CFO &amp; Vice President of Finance</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mark Linehan</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Director</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Byron Scott</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Director</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Siri Marshall</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Director</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dawn Long</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Chief Operating Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 05: BD, Direct Relief, and NACHC Award Four U.S. Community Health Centers for Innovation in Care</p><p>With support from the BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care Award, four U.S.community health centers will be able to advance their innovative care models for at-risk patient populations.</p><p>Each center is awarded $225,000 to implement pharmacist-led comprehensive medication management programs for patients - many of whom are vulnerable to chronic disease. These initiatives focus on educating and counseling patients through team-based care, while also addressing Social Determinants of Health that impact patient outcomes.</p><p>Recipients of the 2025 BD Helping Build Healthy Communities Innovations in Care award are:</p><p>Community Health and Social Services Center (Detroit, MI) will broaden its medication management service for individuals with Type 2 diabetes to include screening for peripheral artery disease and peripheral neuropathy. The program utilizes bilingual community health workers to support enhanced patient communication and engagement. Jane Pauley Community Health Center (Indianapolis, IN) will establish a contextualized care coordination model integrating clinical pharmacists and community health workers to address both clinical needs and social determinants, including nutrition insecurity, transportation, housing, and healthcare access. Family Health Matters Community Health Center (Anaheim, CA) will expand Spanish language-concordant CMM services and implement social determinants of health screening through clinical pharmacy visits. The program will address health literacy, access to healthy food, and social support through expanded group visits.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Direct Relief Awards $250,000 to Texas Organizations Responding to Catastrophic Flooding</p><p>In the wake of severe and widespread flooding across Texas Hill Country in early July, Direct Relief has awarded $250,000 in emergency grant funding to five local organizations delivering critical services to impacted communities. The grants support frontline search-and-rescue and recovery efforts, mental health services, and healthcare access for displaced residents, first responders, and health workers directly affected by the floods.</p><p>TEXSAR (Texas Search and Rescue) - $50,000 to support volunteer-based flood and swiftwater rescue operations, including equipment and training needs. Texas EquuSearch - $50,000 to offset volunteer lodging and deployment costs during ongoing search and recovery missions. Center Point Volunteer Fire Department - $50,000 to support the purchase of a swiftwater rescue boat and to replace other supplies and equipment lost due to the fire station flooding. La Esperanza Clinic - $50,000 to expand mobile medical outreach and public health efforts for flood-affected communities in San Angelo and the Concho Valley. Frontera Healthcare Network - $50,000 to cover healthcare costs for flood survivors, provide mental health and other wraparound services to first responders, and give emergency cash assistance to health center staff experiencing serious financial impacts, enabling them to continue their work.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes.

They had inadvertently arrived a block away from an unfolding firefight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The story is just one of many anecdotes in foreign correspondent and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">7 News</emphasis> presenter Mike Amor's new book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">News Cowboys</emphasis>.</p><p>Mike was in Paris five days after the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, and had heard mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud had been cornered in the suburb of Saint-Denis.</p><p>\"The police initially suspected that we could be involved but our petrified expressions quickly reassured them,\" he writes. \"They ushered us to an area down the street where we could see and hear the fierce gun battle take place.\"</p><p>Police would fire 5000 rounds as explosions rumbled. Abaaoud, his wife and another man would die when a suicide vest exploded.</p><p>Mike must have felt like he was a very long way from his hometown of Bendigo.</p><p>'We had real characters'</p><p>Mike worked for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bendigo Advertiser</emphasis> in the late 1980s and early 1990s, starting as a copy boy after dad and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Addy</emphasis> printer Neil Amor put in a good word for him.</p><p>Then-managing editor Reg McDonald - who had reported from Vietnam's front lines - \"stared intently over his reading glasses\" during the interview, and told Mike \"you should always treat your career as your own business. Don't let others take charge of it\".</p><p>The newsroom was a very colourful place back then, Mike said in a phone interview about the book.</p><p>\"We had real characters,\" he said.</p><p>Mike's dad still worked out the back, the building was full of \"colourful characters\" and grumpy journalists would suddenly come alive after a lunchtime visit to the pub.</p><p>Mike's career in journalism would take him around the world, from drug tunnels in Mexico to the frontlines of the Arab Spring, as rebels shot down planes and overthrew Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.</p><p>There were good times and bad. Mike was in New York when the two World Trade Centre towers fell on September 11, followed Barack Obama around America for his historic 2008 election victory and he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/5131357/mike-amor-trades-trump-stories-for-christmas-back-home/\"> witnessed the rise </url> of Donald Trump.</p><p>'I have all the guns ... in the car'</p><p>Bendigo pops up again and again in Mike's book, often in the most unexpected places.</p><p>The then-Chanel 7 journalist was troubled when covering 1997's Port Arthur Massacre to learn an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertiser</emphasis> print mechanic Doug Hutchinson had been caught up in the carnage.</p><p>The killer had shot Doug in the arm.</p><p>\"A lovely man, Doug was too traumatised to talk to me about it,\" Mike writes.</p><p>One particular Bendigo resident even got an unexpectedly up-close look at the foreign correspondent's work.</p><p>\"This place is mad,\" Mike's dad Neil would say of New Orleans, after the pair's 2005 US road trip was cut short by Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>Mike and Neil had been holidaying in California when the levy banks burst in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, unleashing monstrous walls of water that flooded 80 per cent of the city.</p><p>Neil tagged along as Mike and cameraman Trent Miller barrelled into the disaster zone to find a second catastrophe in the form of a lacklustre response from government authorities.</p><p>It was complete anarchy. A police officer with a rich southern drawl told them: \"Son, I have all the guns I own in the car right now. And even I would not go downtown\".</p><p>'I don't talk about it'</p><p>Neil helped Mike and Trent reach Australians who were trapped in the city, but he did not want to stay.</p><p>\"We had to put him on a plane pretty quickly because he saw dead bodies, and he was kind of disgusted by the treatment of people over there [by American authorities],\" Mike said in his interview with the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertiser</emphasis>.</p><p>Mike and Trent ended up saving multiple groups of Aussies that neither the Americans nor the Australian embassy seemed capable of reaching.</p><p>It was a rare insight for Mike's family into the work that foreign correspondents see.</p><p>So was the new book. Mike's mum Merryl read it and told him she had no idea about much of what he'd done over his three decades as a journalist.</p><p>\"I don't talk about it. I don't really talk about it to my own wife [Tracy]. She's learnt things about my experiences,\" Mike told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertiser</emphasis>.</p><p>\"I tend to do them and, if they are horrible things, I push them down deep and move on.\"</p><p>Who Mike wrote the book for</p><p>Even if no-one else reads <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">News Cowboys</emphasis>, Mike hopes his son Addison gets something out of it.</p><p>He said his biggest regret was that work took him away during so much of Addison's first decade of life.</p><p>Mike is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/6780213/the-people-in-charge-of-protecting-you-could-also-hurt-you-a-parents-heartbreak/\"> currently based </url> in Melbourne but says he \"kind of bristles\" when people call him a former Bendigo boy.</p><p>\"I always refer to myself as a Bendigo boy. My dad still lives there. My mum's there. Our family history dates back to the Gold Rush,\" he said.</p><p>\"I can't say that I'll live there again, but I do love it.\"</p><p>Mike Amor's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">News Cowboys</emphasis> is avialable from July 29.

Seeing our work firsthand was both humbling and inspiring. Nothing compares.</p><p>Meeting so many dedicated people and organizations committed to improving health and lives makes it impossible to leave without a deep sense of hope - and an even stronger commitment to humanitarian work. Over the course of just a few days, I had the privilege of meeting three remarkable women whose lives are dedicated to creating lasting change.</p><p>In Accra, we met with Elizabeth Esi Denyo, President of the Ghana Diabetes Association, and toured a clinic participating in the Life for a Child program - a partnership between Direct Relief, Eli Lilly, and the Ghana Diabetes Association to provide free insulin to children and young adults living with Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 13: Direct Relief Foundation How Do Countries Compare in Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes Updated Data Hub Has the Answers</p><p>Looking globally at the health outcomes of women and babies and comparing those rates across time could be a daunting task for any researcher, but a newly revamped data hub aims to bring that information together - and provide insights about the path forward.</p><p>The International Confederation of Midwives, or ICM, a non-governmental global advocacy group representing more than 1 million midwives globally, relaunched a digital data hub in July 2025. The hub's architects say the platform, which can be found on ICM's website here, is structured to be intuitive and user-friendly for anyone who wants a deep dive into global maternal and infant health outcomes. Data scientists say they hope the public data can be used to help medical professionals advocate for better outcomes globally.</p><p>\"When you see the data, when you see the country comparison, you can't un-see it,\" said Jessica White, who worked as the Global Midwives' Data Hub Lead for ICM. \"And I think when you know better, you do better.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.' Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000. The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.</p><p>Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Direct Relief Foundation Beyond ABCs: School-Based Health Centers Provide Care for Students</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 04: Direct Relief Foundation For Children in Ukraine, Medical Transport Covers Last Mile to Care</p><p>When war broke out in February 2022, German paramedic Marc Friedrich was in disbelief.</p><p>\"We had imagined that there would be no more war in Europe, and then suddenly Russia attacked,\" he recalled.</p><p>That disbelief soon gave way to determination.</p><p>On March 9, an airstrike struck Mariupol's Maternity Hospital No. 3, killing four people and injuring at least 16 others.</p><p>\"That was a trigger moment for me,\" said Friedrich, who left his role as emergency services paramedic chief near Dusseldorf to establish a dedicated ambulance service for children in Ukraine.</p><p>\"I wanted to configure an ambulance specially to the needs of children, where the equipment doesn't have to be specially prepared for them but is rather the standard,\" said Friedrich, founder of Ambulance for Kids. Such emergency service vehicles are very rare in both Germany and Ukraine, Friedrich notes.</p><p>Acquiring an ambulance and equipping it for pediatric care cost at least $350,000.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise.

Seeing our work firsthand was both humbling and inspiring. Nothing compares.</p><p>Meeting so many dedicated people and organizations committed to improving health and lives makes it impossible to leave without a deep sense of hope - and an even stronger commitment to humanitarian work. Over the course of just a few days, I had the privilege of meeting three remarkable women whose lives are dedicated to creating lasting change.</p><p>In Accra, we met with Elizabeth Esi Denyo, President of the Ghana Diabetes Association, and toured a clinic participating in the Life for a Child program - a partnership between Direct Relief, Eli Lilly, and the Ghana Diabetes Association to provide free insulin to children and young adults living with Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 13: Direct Relief Foundation How Do Countries Compare in Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes Updated Data Hub Has the Answers</p><p>Looking globally at the health outcomes of women and babies and comparing those rates across time could be a daunting task for any researcher, but a newly revamped data hub aims to bring that information together - and provide insights about the path forward.</p><p>The International Confederation of Midwives, or ICM, a non-governmental global advocacy group representing more than 1 million midwives globally, relaunched a digital data hub in July 2025. The hub's architects say the platform, which can be found on ICM's website here, is structured to be intuitive and user-friendly for anyone who wants a deep dive into global maternal and infant health outcomes. Data scientists say they hope the public data can be used to help medical professionals advocate for better outcomes globally.</p><p>\"When you see the data, when you see the country comparison, you can't un-see it,\" said Jessica White, who worked as the Global Midwives' Data Hub Lead for ICM. \"And I think when you know better, you do better.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Direct Relief Foundation 'The Nose Knows.' Search Dogs Train To Save Lives</p><p>A black Labrador bounded across a strewn rubble pile under the hot mid-morning sun. His nose moved like a violinist's bow, dancing quickly and carefully in every direction, as it led him in pursuit of his goal. A team of helmet-clad first responders from across the U.S. stood atop the gray concrete pile in rapt attention, following the dog's every move.</p><p>Suddenly, a bark. He found a body. In this case, the \"body\" was a participant at a recent National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, or SDF, training session. The dog, tail wagging furiously, was handed a chew toy, which he proudly carried as he pranced out of the rubble pile.</p><p>This was a practice run, but realism is key at the SDF's 145-acre training facility in Ventura County, California. The foundation trains dogs for FEMA and state-level rescue operations. Since its founding in 1996 by Wilma Melville, a FEMA-certified canine search specialist who responded during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, SDF-trained teams have deployed to nearly 300 disasters.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 11: Twenty Years Ago, Hurricane Katrina Transformed American Healthcare - and Direct Relief</p><p>When Janet Mentesane thinks back to the sheer scale of medical need after Hurricane Katrina, her strongest memory isn't of providers treating physical trauma or water-borne diseases. It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians.

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000.

If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Direct Relief Foundation Beyond ABCs: School-Based Health Centers Provide Care for Students</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation Emergency Update: Direct Relief Monitoring Tsunami Threats in Pacific</p><p>Direct Relief is closely monitoring reports of an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia and the resulting tsunami warnings, which have prompted evacuation orders across Japan and Hawai\u02bb i, as well as other coastal areas throughout the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Direct Relief is coordinating with the organization's network of healthcare providers, first responder organizations, and international agencies across at-risk areas to assess needs and stands ready to provide emergency medical support and supplies should needs arise.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical. The reason? People feel more empathy toward small businesses and are more inclined to support them with better reviews.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 23: Tulane University: Study shows how El NiNo and La NiNa climate swings threaten mangroves worldwide</p><p>A new international study led by researchers at Tulane University shows that the El NiNo and La NiNa climate patterns affect nearly half of the world's mangrove forests, underscoring the vulnerability of these vital coastal ecosystems to climatic shifts.

It's of people with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic health issues - the non-communicable diseases that affect billions of people worldwide - evacuating without their medications.</p><p>\"There was a massive amount of people who were showing up and multiple shelters that were opening up,\" recalled Mentesane, who was the executive director of MLK Health, a free clinic and pharmacy in Shreveport, Louisiana, about five hours' drive from New Orleans. (She is currently the clinic's grants manager.) \"They had no medications and no physicians. Their pharmacies were destroyed, along with the records and data.\"</p><p>Mentesane's experience reflects a larger challenge of the Hurricane Katrina response that surprised many - although not the safety net providers working on the ground.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Direct Relief Mobilizes Aid for the Canyon Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties</p><p>Direct Relief is responding to two wildfires in California-supporting communities under evacuation from the rapidly spreading Canyon Fire in Los Angeles County while continuing to address smoke-related health risks from the massive Gifford Fire on the Central Coast.</p><p>The Canyon Fire, which ignited Thursday near Lake Piru, has burned nearly 5,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000. The fire is currently about 15 percent contained and is impacting rural areas of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.</p><p>Direct Relief is based in Santa Barbara County, and has extensive experience responding to wildfires across the state. This week, the organization provided free respirators to residents at multiple locations throughout the county and will continue to respond as air quality needs continue.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation In Central Texas, A Health Center Cares for Flood-Devastated Communities, First Responders - and Its Staff</p><p>In the first weeks after floods tore through central Texas, killing at least 138 people and damaging thousands of homes, people kept their heads down and pushed through.</p><p>Mikki Hand, a family nurse practitioner and executive director of Frontera Healthcare, a community health center serving a number of severely impacted communities, described a provider who came into work despite losing her home to the floods. \"I have more than our patients, and I didn't lose somebody,\" the provider told her.</p><p>\"I can control this, but I can help people. If I go home, I have nothing left, and I'm not ready to deal with that,\" Hand recalled a staff member saying.</p><p>Hand, a seasoned provider and community health leader, knew the worst need was still ahead.</p><p>Frontera staff who had lost their homes or suffered severe damage faced overwhelming financial challenges. Meanwhile, first responders-nearly all of them volunteers-were returning to their own hard-hit neighborhoods after taking on swift water rescues and emergency operations that otherwise might not have happened, Hand explained. \"They're expected to resume their everyday lives,\" she said.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Direct Relief Foundation Beyond ABCs: School-Based Health Centers Provide Care for Students</p><p>School isn't just a place for students to learn; it's increasingly become a place young people rely on for critical services, including healthcare. That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground. A recent feature by NASA's Applied Sciences Program highlights how real-time imagery and damage modeling supported Direct Relief's situational awareness as fires swept through Los Angeles County.</p><p>In the days following the Eaton Fire in Altadena, researchers from Direct Relief and partner institutions used radar imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to assess structural damage. When layered with fire perimeter data and public infrastructure maps, the result was a publicly available interactive model showing likely damage across the region-including near health facilities.</p><p>The analysis, developed in collaboration with Oregon State University's Jamon Van Den Hoek, Microsoft's AI for Good, RxResponse, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and Direct Relief, helped responders quickly understand which areas faced the most severe impacts.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 04: Direct Relief Foundation For Children in Ukraine, Medical Transport Covers Last Mile to Care</p><p>When war broke out in February 2022, German paramedic Marc Friedrich was in disbelief.</p><p>\"We had imagined that there would be no more war in Europe, and then suddenly Russia attacked,\" he recalled.</p><p>That disbelief soon gave way to determination.</p><p>On March 9, an airstrike struck Mariupol's Maternity Hospital No. 3, killing four people and injuring at least 16 others.</p><p>\"That was a trigger moment for me,\" said Friedrich, who left his role as emergency services paramedic chief near Dusseldorf to establish a dedicated ambulance service for children in Ukraine.</p><p>\"I wanted to configure an ambulance specially to the needs of children, where the equipment doesn't have to be specially prepared for them but is rather the standard,\" said Friedrich, founder of Ambulance for Kids.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes.

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for roughly 5,000 people and 700 structures, with an additional 11,000 residents and 4,700 structures under evacuation warnings.</p><p>Often as a result of being evacuated, displaced individuals experience disruption in essential healthcare, including lack of access to critically needed medications. People living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension may be forced to leave home without the medicines or supplies they rely on daily. Within a 20-mile radius of the Canyon Fire, seven Direct Relief-supported health centers are part of a critical network needed to ensure that displaced and impacted residents can refill prescriptions and receive care during and after the emergency. The organization has contacted each location, offering any medical aid assistance needed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 07: Direct Relief Foundation Gifford Fire Response: N95 Respirators Available in Santa Barbara County</p><p>In response to the Gifford Fire, Direct Relief is distributing free N95 respirators to people experiencing poor air quality as a result of the fire.</p><p>The Gifford Fire, which broke out on August 1 in northern Santa Barbara County, was the largest fire burning in California as of Thursday, when acres burned neared 100,000.

That's the case for over 7,000 students in two parishes in northwestern Louisiana. They can receive wellness checks, vaccines, acute care, and behavioral and chronic health support, all without leaving school grounds. More students are expected to have access to medical care this upcoming school year.</p><p>For 30 years, children in four Caddo Parish schools could receive medical care at school. Since students have returned to in-school learning following the pandemic, David Raines Community Health Center has increased those efforts to include 21 schools to encourage and support healthy kids in northern Louisiana.</p><p>The school-based program expanded into neighboring Bossier Parish to include two more schools during the 2024-2025 school year, and will grow again in Fall 2025 with an additional mobile medical unit. Health center staff say the increased access to care allows families to learn about basic hygiene and health needs, which will improve the community's quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 05: NASA Spotlights Direct Relief's Use of Satellite Data During Los Angeles Fires</p><p>When wildfires erupted across Southern California in January 2025, Direct Relief turned to satellite data to understand the scale of destruction-and to trusted community health partners to meet urgent medical needs on the ground.

The program, born from a stark reality check-a shocking 51 percent maternal mortality rate at a rural Nigerian hospital in 2023-aims to empower local midwives and other health workers with critical education and essential supplies.</p><p>Adole's vision is deeply rooted in the belief that sustainable change comes from within communities and is championed by those who best understand their unique needs.</p><p>\"About 85 percent of the people who attended our programs were women and children,\" she said. \"But in 2023, we heard an alarming statistic: the maternal mortality rate at a rural hospital in Nigeria was 51 percent. That changed everything.\"</p><p>Adole, a nurse and a Black woman, established the U-VOL Foundation in 2014. The organization's mission focuses on creating high-quality, community-driven programs while challenging the scarcity of diverse leadership in global health. Her decision to focus initially on Nigeria stemmed from personal connections and a firsthand understanding of the immense need. The Value Her initiative was a direct response to the candid feedback from midwives and other health staff themselves, who articulated a pressing need not for complex solutions, but for fundamental education and basic supplies.</p><p>July 29: Direct Relief Foundation The Hidden Part Of Wildfire Recovery in Altadena, And Beyond</p><p>Seven months after the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, many families are still living in temporary housing, schools are adjusting to the loss of students, and residents are grappling with more than the logistics of rebuilding their homes.

Milton has vacillated between a category four and five event, with category five reserved for those hurricanes of at least 252km/h.</p><p>What preparations are taking place?</p><p>Schools and workplaces have been closed, and evacuation orders for a million people around Tampa and Florida's east coast have been put in place. Those who are staying have been warned to get to higher ground.</p><p>The most dire warning came from Florida's Attorney-General Ashley Moody, who suggested people who ignored evacuation orders would very possibly die.</p><p>\"You probably need to write your name in permanent marker on your arm so that people know who you are when they get to you afterwards,\" she said.</p><p>How does Hurricane Milton compare to Hurricane Katrina?</p><p>Milton's wind speed has been as high as 290km/h but more recently dropped to a still-astonishing 270km/h. One of the most infamous hurricanes in US history is Hurricane Katrina, which smashed New Orleans in 2005, resulting in more than 1200 deaths and an estimated damage bill of $185bn.

Almost 20 years later, a new report offers a complex portrait of progress and trade-offs that education policymakers throughout the country are still scrutinizing.</p><p>The report by Tulane University's Education Research Alliance for New Orleans summarizes more than a decade of research into 12 key lessons from the city's sweeping education reforms. Those changes were driven largely by the flooding and destruction of many school buildings and a history of underperformance by schools within the traditional system. In the wake of Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the city's schools, resulting in a system where nearly all public schools became charter schools.</p><p>The report found that student outcomes improved dramatically following the near-total overhaul of the city's public school system under the new post-Katrina system. Test scores, high school graduation rates and college attendance all rose - sometimes by double digits - after the city shifted almost all public schools to independently operated charter schools governed by performance contracts.</p><p>May 30: Tulane University: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>In a large-scale, international study published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers found that smaller companies receive more favorable online word-of-mouth than larger ones-even when the customer experience is identical. The reason? People feel more empathy toward small businesses and are more inclined to support them with better reviews.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 30: Tulane study finds smaller companies get kinder online reviews - And empathy is the reason why</p><p>Consumers often turn to online reviews to decide where to shop, eat or book services, but a new Tulane University study finds that star ratings might be influenced by something other than product quality - the size of the company.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 23: Tulane University: Study shows how El NiNo and La NiNa climate swings threaten mangroves worldwide</p><p>A new international study led by researchers at Tulane University shows that the El NiNo and La NiNa climate patterns affect nearly half of the world's mangrove forests, underscoring the vulnerability of these vital coastal ecosystems to climatic shifts.

By 2050, the World Health Organization estimates it could surpass cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death as more bacteria develop defenses to the drugs designed to combat them.</p><p>Now researchers from Tulane University and Informuta, Inc. have identified a unique genetic signature in bacteria that can predict their likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance, according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The findings could help researchers more quickly identify precision-based treatments that are more effective against the deadly, treatment-resistant pathogens.
