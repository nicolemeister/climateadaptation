Their initiatives encompass food security, sustainability advocacy, curriculum development and promoting sustainability through film, resulting in widespread achievements across the Penn State community.</p><p>* Ashley Currey, an undergraduate at University Park, is a passionate sustainability advocate, serving as a sustainability engagement intern since June 2024. During this time, she played a key role in revitalizing the Tailgate Ambassadors program, educating football fans on recyclingand creatingthe Shaker Reuse program, diverting thousands of plastic shakers from landfills. She now leads the zero-waste team within Net Impact, Smeal's sustainable business club. Additionally, Currey contributed to the Local Climate Action Program, creating a greenhouse gasinventory for the Centre Region to inform future climate action plans.</p><p>* Marisela Sotelo Tornero, a graduate student at University Park, is a leading voice in water sustainability and equity, with a deep commitment to improving access to safe water and sanitation in underserved communities across Latin America and the U.S. Her evidence-based research has directly influenced public policy, including award-winning work highlighting the leadership of rural women in water management. Tornero's global experience spans government partnerships, grassroots advocacyand rigorous policy analysis.</p><p>* James Bell, an undergraduate student at Penn State Schuylkill, is recognized for his unwavering commitment to sustainability and community engagement. His work bridges science, education, and action, with involvement in diverse research projects ranging from soil microbes and sustainable antibiotics to community tree planting and pollinator health. Over the past three years, Bell has played a vital role in shaping campus sustainability programming, from hands-on research to education and outreach. A driving force behind the Beekeeping Club's revival and the expansion of campus gardening initiatives, Bell connects environmental stewardship with community impact, embodying the spirit of sustainability at every level.</p><p>* Sylvie Alexander, an undergraduate student at University Park, is president of the Earth House Living Learning Community (LLC) and is a passionate advocate for sustainability and community engagement. Through collaboration with the Student Farm, Alexander co-directs two major projects, including a rooftop garden and food justice initiatives.

With a focus on climate action and student advocacy, he has led initiatives that brought energy dashboards to campus, championed a climate action resolution, and called for institutional commitments from University leadership. His film collaborations, including \"For the Future,\" have highlighted student-driven change and reached tens of thousands, earning spots at University-wide showcases and regional film festivals.</p><p>Student Sustainability Advisory Council Tree Award</p><p>The 2025 Student Sustainability Advisory Council Tree Award honors Gavin Maxson for his exceptional leadership in sustainability at the University Park campus. As an EcoRep for three years, Maxson took on a leadership role as senior programming coordinator, guiding sustainability initiatives and engaging with the campus community. Additionally, Maxson served as a Sustainable Lab Consultant (SLC) for the Sustainable Labs Program, a pilot initiative aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainability in research labs. Throughout his time as an SLC, Maxson supported over 30 research labs, helping reduce energy consumption and waste through projects such as installing fume hood sensors and improving energy efficiency. A tree was planted in his honor on April 23 as a lasting symbol of his commitment and influence, and he will receive a $1,000 award from Penn State Sustainability.</p><p>\"Gavin represents everything the Tree Award is about,\" said SSAC Chair Jacob Seiler, a John Roe Sustainability Impact Award winner. \"He has been such a strong, consistent, reliable leader in the sustainability community, and he always does that work with kindness and joy. Gavin leaves behind a legacy of unwavering commitment to sustainability at Penn State. I'm really excited that we now have a tree on campus to celebrate his leadership and his impact on this University and this community.\"</p><p>Pennsylvania Environmental Resource Consortium (PERC) Campus Sustainability Champion Award</p><p>The PERC Award celebrates contributions to sustainability by Penn State community members. This year's award celebrates the Penn State Food Recovery Network. The student-led Food Recovery Network aims to promote sustainability and food security, and to raise awareness about issues surrounding food waste. The organization recovers unserved food from four University Park dining halls and transports it to student and community partners. In its first year, more than 2,500 pounds of food were rescued and redistributed, thereby preventing waste from being sent to landfills. This prevented the release of more than 9,500 pounds of carbon dioxide from decaying food waste, according to the organization's annual report. Since the chapter's emergence, this mitigation has increased exponentially from 9,500 pounds to more than 23,200 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. The Food Recovery Network student team accepting the award includes Adeline Peat, Anna Janaszek, Emmanuel Kraft, Anant Pothakamury, Irini Gentis and Eliana Wong.</p><p>The 2025 Sustainability Awards highlight the comprehensive efforts across Penn State to advance sustainability in education, research, operations and community engagement.

Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.<br/>Accountability cited<br/>The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote.<br/>Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \"slush fund\" and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden's climate agenda. It was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.<br/>Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \"zero tolerance of any waste and abuse\" at the EPA under his administration.<br/>\"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 02-15 A6 US-EPA-Green-Bank, 4th Ld-Writethru_A06<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8483327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHM-BGS3-RSDJ-S2GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.<br/>Accountability cited<br/>The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote.<br/>Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \"slush fund\" and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden's climate agenda. It was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.<br/>Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \"zero tolerance of any waste and abuse\" at the EPA under his administration.<br/>\"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 02-15 A6 US-EPA-Green-Bank, 4th Ld-Writethru_A06<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8482679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHM-BGS3-RSDJ-S28X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

We all need to work together as a community with an equity focus to reach these high and necessary goals.</p><p>I am in full support of the Climate Equity Plan. I am so proud of the Citys Health Department staff and community members who collaborated to develop this thorough and ambitious plan to address climate change, said Council Member LaTrisha Vetaw (Ward 4.) I look forward to working with City staff and the community to move this plan from paper to reality.</p><p>Making your voice heard</p><p>By creating a Climate Equity Plan for all, the City strives to achieve an environmentally just, resilient, low-carbon and equitable city. Community member, partner, and stakeholder input was crucial in creating the final plan.</p><p>During the public comment period (April 19-June 5), the Health Department received more than 1,000 responses with more than 1,800 comments. The top three comments were:</p><p>Create a more aggressive timeline</p><p>Create bigger, more measurable, and more transparent goals</p><p>Show which departments are accountable for carrying out the plan</p><p>The top five topics of importance included:</p><p>Energy Systems (24%)</p><p>Healthy Homes (22%)</p><p>Transportation (14.5%)</p><p>Green Buildings (9%)</p><p>Green economy and workforce (8%)</p><p>Environmental justice and equity</p><p>Climate change significantly impacts underserved communities, including our Green Zones. The City seeks to improve the health and well-being of those living in Green Zone communities who are disproportionately impacted by pollution, racism, poverty, and other factors. The Climate Equity Plan will:</p><p>Ensure increased, dedicated, and equitable funding for historically under-resourced communities and Green Zones.</p><p>Engage diverse communities in localized community spaces, providing transparent, multilingual communication and resources to include residents in the decision-making process.</p><p>Create green and union job opportunities with intentional investments in workforce development strategies that target Black, Indigenous, and communities of color.</p><p>Address systemic harms experienced by marginalized groups.</p><p>Results from feedback</p><p>As a result of the feedback, the final plan includes:</p><p>A 12-month working timeline to show what areas of work will begin immediately</p><p>Goals, strategies, and actions that clearly connect how work will achieve emission reduction targets</p><p>A clear list of departments and entities responsible for implementing the plan</p><p>A mechanism for tracking and publishing data for funding, programs, and environmental justice outcomes</p><p>On-going, dedicated climate funding that incorporates community input</p><p>Partnerships with unions, trades, and community organizations to create living wage green jobs</p><p>Information on improving indoor and outdoor air quality</p><p>Reducing impact on climate change</p><p>By working together, reducing climate change will become reality. The seven strategies that will be prioritized to achieve the planned outcomes by 2030 are:</p><p>Insulate and weatherize 5,000 homes, prioritizing homes in Green Zones.</p><p>Eliminate the number of households with an energy burden over 6%.</p><p>Reduce fossil (natural) gas emissions by 35%.</p><p>Train and support 1,000 Minneapolis community members in new green jobs.</p><p>Expand green space, tree planting and local and sustainable food systems.</p><p>Reduce emissions from commercial buildings by 75%.</p><p>Achieve 100% renewable electricity citywide, with 30% coming from local solar energy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126032051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RT-RNH1-JCBF-S284-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 20, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The change in focus comes in conjunction with the recently passed continuing resolution that addresses transit funds still flowing from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</p><p>According toanalysisby the American Public Transit Association the CR \"provides $20.9 billion for public transit in fiscal year 2025, an increase of $82 million (0.4%) from the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. This total funding represents 95% of the amount authorized in the IIJA.\"</p><p>Federal grants for transit typically require municipalities to provide matching funds that are often leveraged with public financing. The public transit sector has been struggling to recover from the pandemic which put a crimp in farebox revenues.</p><p>\"There has been some recovery in passenger ridership levels across the nation. It varies by region and by system,\" said Kurt Forsgren, managing director, sector lead S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p><p>\"There has been a general recovery, and that's continuing with more return-to-work mandates by employers.\"</p><p>The comments came during panel discussion produced by the Volcker Alliance and the Penn Institute for Urban Research on Tuesday.</p><p>S&amp;P is currently maintaining negative outlooks on three major transit systems, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, Bay Area Rapid Transit and the Chicago Transit Authority.</p><p>\"That means there's a one in three chance that the rate could go down for the next couple of years,\" said Forsgren.</p><p>Leslie Richards, former general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority notes a budget shortfall over $200 million.</p><p>Federal funding freezes are raising concerns in cities designated as sanctuary cities including Chicago, which is awaiting federal funding for a major airport project.</p><p>\"We've got a $12 billion expansion of O'Hare that is just getting underway that's counting on nearly $400 million of federal money that has been committed,\" said David Greising, president and CEO of the Better Government Association.</p><p>\"The one that everybody's watching very closely is the extension of the Chicago Transit Authority's Red Line.\"</p><p>Flat funding levels for transit and increased ridership levels in some markets factor into a transit equation that includes new requirements by the Trump administration.</p><p>\"The administration has frozen funding for some transit projects and just released guidance to review and potentially re-scope or cancel discretionary programs going back as far as 2021 that address climate equity, environmental justice, cycling and electric vehicles if the project sponsors have not yet signed grant agreements and obligated funds,\" said Polly Trottenberg, former DOT Deputy Secretary who served under Secretary Buttigieg.</p><p>\"This is the first time an administration has tried to cancel or re-scope projects en masse that have already been awarded funding through a competitive application process.\"</p><p>\"It adds a new level of uncertainty for a federal surface transportation program that typically operates in somewhat stable ways in five-year cycles of Congressional authorization and funding,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

ProPublica</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/have-government-employees-mentioned-climate-change-voting-or-gender-identity-the-heritage-foundation-wants-to-know\">quoted a worker as saying, 'They're taking time away from FOIA requesters that have legitimate requests. We have to search people's accounts for poop. This isn't a thing.'</url></p><p>Today, Jankowski oversees FOIA compliance for DHS as its  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dhs.gov/person/roman-jankowski\">chief FOIA officer. His agency</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foia.gov/data.html\">receives more public records requests than any other by a wide margin. And instead of gumming up FOIA administration from the outside, Jankowski now works for an administration that is attacking FOIA by firing many of the federal employees who respond to those requests, precisely what his records requests sought to facilitate.</url></p><p>As a key transparency law, the Freedom of Information Act gives the public insight into government activities, allowing Americans to hold the government to account. It's been used to reveal stories about conflicts of interest and corporate abuse that otherwise may have never seen the light of day.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/topics/revolving-door-project/\">Read more from the Revolving Door Project</url></p><p>The New York Times  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/insider/information-freedom-reporters-pruitt.html\">attributed the resignation of Trump 1.0 EPA chief Scott Pruitt to a 'steady drumbeat' of news about his misuse of government resources, underpinned by information obtained through FOIA. (Perhaps that's part of the reason Trump 2.0 has a bone to pick with FOIA this time around.)</url></p><p>During the Biden era, FOIA requests  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/USTR%20REPORT.pdf\">unveiled a cozy relationship between U.S. trade officials and Big Tech lobbyists while the former negotiated a major trade agreement, leading Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to ring the alarm on '</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/new-investigative-report-from-senator-warren-reveals-big-techs-insider-influence-on-digital-trade-rules\">corporate influence-peddling' within trade policy.</url></p><p>It's not just about corruption-threats to effective FOIA administration have tangible downstream effects. Reshma Ramachandran, assistant professor of medicine at Yale, recently  <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-sudden-dismissal-of-public-records-staff-at-health-agencies-threatens-government-accountability-254024\">wrote about the vital role that FOIA requests can play in protecting public health. Per Ramachandran, FOIA requests have 'pushed companies to</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.39024.487720.68\">take unsafe drugs off the market, led to reforms that</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/PHH.0000000000000871\">prevent unnecessary delays in communicating public health risks, and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doggett.house.gov/media/blog-post/bicameral-bipartisan-track-act-introduced-provide-transparency-taxpayer\">prompted policies that</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/09/13/covid-regeneron-white-house-price-limits/\">lower prices and improve access to taxpayer-funded health technologies.'</url></p><p>Even the president himself knows the value of FOIA requests. Bloomberg's Jason Leopold, author of the newsletter ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/foia-files\">FOIA Files,' recently used FOIA to</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-04/trump-filed-foia-request-to-national-archives-about-classified-docs\">obtain a records request (and the responsive documents) that President Trump made to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Back in 2023, Trump demanded records that his lawyers claimed would 'expose NARA's completely different treatment of President Trump from every other president.' (Leopold concluded that the request 'doesn't appear to have unearthed any smoking guns.')</url></p><p>It is hard to understand FOIA office layoffs as anything but an intentional effort to obstruct access to public records.</p><p>But to an administration that is hell-bent on defying the rule of law, public accountability is anathema. So, unsurprisingly, the DOGE-led attacks on the civil service have-in some cases specifically-decimated FOIA offices, severely weakening a key tool that helps the public understand what the federal government is doing.</p><p>At the beginning of April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/us-health-agency-mass-firings-begin-as-kennedy-orders-10-000-cut\">laid off the entire FOIA office staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He also</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hhs-firings-federal-health-agencies-foia-requests-public-records/\">cut FOIA staff significantly at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Following public outcry, RFK Jr. said he would be '</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5375065/cdc-hhs-public-records-foia\">restoring all FOIA offices' last week, though he failed to provide detail about how or if they plan to recall or replace terminated workers. Call us cynical, but it's hard to imagine that an administration whose main goal seems to be destruction of the civil service will effectively 'restore' even a small segment of that service.</url></p><p>At places  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-04/trump-filed-foia-request-to-national-archives-about-classified-docs\">like USAID, the Department of Education, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where entire agencies have been illegally gutted to the point of nonfunctionality, FOIA offices have apparently not been spared. The Office of Personnel Management has</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html\">laid off FOIA staff, and Trump fired the top Department of Justice official</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-justice-dept-fires-head-pardon-office-2025-03-07/\">overseeing FOIA administration. The Times even</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/foia-office-callout.html\">set up a tip line for federal employees to report cuts to FOIA departments.</url></p><p>It is hard to understand FOIA office layoffs as anything but an intentional effort to obstruct access to public records. Prior to the second Trump administration, FOIA offices already lacked the capacity to consistently process all of the requests they received. A March 2024 analysis of agencies' chief FOIA officer reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO)  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106535.pdf#page=58\">found that the single most cited contributor to increasing FOIA backlogs in 2023 was 'FOIA staffing losses or turnover,' with over half of responding agencies citing it as a factor. And it wasn't a trivial factor; the GAO also</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106535.pdf#page=23\">wrote that many agency officials 'identified staffing issues as among the biggest contributors to backlogs' (emphasis added).</url></p><p>HHS's own chief FOIA officer  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hhs.gov/foia/statutes-and-resources/officers-reports/2025-section-5/index.html\">noted in the agency's annual report that there was an increase in the backlog of requests in 2024 in part because of 'a loss of key staff' and 'staff turnover.' The report was released on March 10, 2025, just three weeks before Kennedy moved to gut multiple HHS FOIA offices.</url></p><p>And the attacks on public records go beyond illegal layoffs and office closures. The administration has  <url normalizedValue=\"https://americanoversight.org/doge-tells-american-oversight-its-records-are-not-subject-to-foia-contradicting-judges-recent-ruling/\">argued that DOGE-the very body that facilitated much of the FOIA office-gutting-is exempt from FOIA requests, even though Elon Musk</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856520760656797801\">claimed after the election that DOGE would operate with 'maximum transparency.' And Trump himself is threatening to wreck organizations that dare question his actions.</url></p><p>While the administration staunchly refuses to be ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html\">maximally</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html\">transparent,' groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) are trying to get answers. CREW is currently suing the Trump administration for</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/legal-action/lawsuits/crew-sues-us-doge-service-to-compel-transparency/\">refusing to comply with its FOIA requests on DOGE's activities. To prop up their argument that DOGE and Musk aren't subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the administration has</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/musk-doge-wont-release-public-records-nonprofit-says/\">claimed that Musk doesn't work for DOGE-despite Trump's</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5159062-donald-trump-elon-musk-advice/\">personal posts and a basic comprehension of daily news contradicting that idea-and that the roughly 100</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/doge-staff-attacks-federal-government/\">operatives under Musk's direction are not acting independently from the office of the president.</url></p><p>So far, CREW has been successful in their challenge-just this month, a district judge issued an opinion  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/news/press-releases/judge-grants-crew-discovery-in-doge-foia-suit/\">requiring DOGE to respond to CREW's questions to determine if DOGE is subject to FOIA, including ordering the deposition of DOGE administrator Amy Gleason. CREW is also suing to</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/legal-action/lawsuits/crew-sues-to-challenge-destruction-of-cdc-foia-office/\">stop the destruction of the CDC's FOIA office, while American Oversight is attempting to stop the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://americanoversight.org/american-oversight-sues-trump-administration-for-directing-agency-staff-to-shred-and-burn-government-records/\">destruction of</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://americanoversight.org/doge-suffers-another-setback-american-oversight-wins-court-order-forcing-preservation-of-records/\">government records and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pogo.org/post/pogo-sues-president-trump-and-doge-over-access-to-records\">other</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://democracyforward.org/work/foia-lawsuits/\">groups are suing the admin for DOGE's records. But the efforts have also drawn the ire of the president himself: Two days after the judge's order in the DOGE FOIA case, Trump</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tax-exempt-crew-environmental-groups-harvard-5e1e0ffacfa040ccdeaf4e43fb72b5fe\">threatened to (illegally, for the record) strip CREW of its tax-exempt status.</url></p><p>This administration's attack on FOIA staff and the Freedom of Information Act in general will harm the public in ways that will be difficult to directly appreciate for some time. The critical information that we will fail to learn from destroyed and otherwise inaccessible records is, by definition, unknowable. But if past experience is any indication, the gutting of FOIA offices will probably result in more corruption, more public-health crises, and at least according to some people, more civil servants emailing each other the word 'defecate.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/justice/2025-05-01-public-records-wreckers/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXPB-TPPD102301546944721789252099060010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TPPD-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FPG-0033-RWN5-X33D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1390\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

He was one-third of a three-man <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/have-government-employees-mentioned-climate-change-voting-or-gender-identity-the-heritage-foundation-wants-to-know\">fishing expedition</url></emphasis> spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation and the Daily Caller to dig up dirt on civil servants, particularly if they were the type to use phrases like \u201cclimate equity\u201d or \u201cvoting.\u201d Some of Jankowski\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/24_0925-PRIV-Chief-FOIA-Officer-Weekly-Report-January-8th%2C2024-to-September-23%2C2024.pdf#page=189\">requests</url></emphasis> were for emails sent by DHS staffers containing the word \u201cBiden\u201d alongside a range of other key words, including \u201cdrugs,\u201d \u201cdefecate,\u201d and \u201cpoop.\u201d ProPublica <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/have-government-employees-mentioned-climate-change-voting-or-gender-identity-the-heritage-foundation-wants-to-know\">quoted</url></emphasis> a worker as saying, \u201cThey\u2019re taking time away from FOIA requesters that have legitimate requests. We have to search people\u2019s accounts for poop. This isn\u2019t a thing.\u201d</p><p>Today, Jankowski oversees FOIA compliance for DHS as its <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dhs.gov/person/roman-jankowski\">chief FOIA officer</url></emphasis>. His agency <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foia.gov/data.html\">receives</url></emphasis> more public records requests than any other by a wide margin. And instead of gumming up FOIA administration from the outside, Jankowski now works for an administration that is attacking FOIA by firing many of the federal employees who respond to those requests, precisely what his records requests sought to facilitate.</p><p>As a key transparency law, the Freedom of Information Act gives the public insight into government activities, allowing Americans to hold the government to account. It\u2019s been used to reveal stories about conflicts of interest and corporate abuse that otherwise may have never seen the light of day.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/topics/revolving-door-project/\">Read more from the Revolving Door Project</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/insider/information-freedom-reporters-pruitt.html\">attributed the resignation</url></emphasis> of Trump 1.0 EPA chief Scott Pruitt to a \u201csteady drumbeat\u201d of news about his misuse of government resources, underpinned by information obtained through FOIA. (Perhaps that\u2019s part of the reason Trump 2.0 has a bone to pick with FOIA this time around.)</p><p>During the Biden era, FOIA requests <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/USTR%20REPORT.pdf\">unveiled</url></emphasis> a cozy relationship between U.S. trade officials and Big Tech lobbyists while the former negotiated a major trade agreement, leading Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to ring the alarm on \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/new-investigative-report-from-senator-warren-reveals-big-techs-insider-influence-on-digital-trade-rules\">corporate influence-peddling</url></emphasis>\u201d within trade policy.</p><p>It\u2019s not just about corruption\u2014threats to effective FOIA administration have tangible downstream effects. Reshma Ramachandran, assistant professor of medicine at Yale, recently <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-sudden-dismissal-of-public-records-staff-at-health-agencies-threatens-government-accountability-254024\">wrote</url></emphasis> about the vital role that FOIA requests can play in protecting public health. Per Ramachandran, FOIA requests have \u201cpushed companies to <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.39024.487720.68\">take unsafe drugs off the market</url></emphasis>, led to reforms that <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/PHH.0000000000000871\">prevent unnecessary delays</url></emphasis> in communicating public health risks, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://doggett.house.gov/media/blog-post/bicameral-bipartisan-track-act-introduced-provide-transparency-taxpayer\">prompted policies</url></emphasis> that <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/09/13/covid-regeneron-white-house-price-limits/\">lower prices and improve access</url></emphasis> to taxpayer-funded health technologies.\u201d</p><p>Even the president himself knows the value of FOIA requests. Bloomberg\u2019s Jason Leopold, author of the newsletter \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/foia-files\">FOIA Files</url></emphasis>,\u201d recently used FOIA to <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-04/trump-filed-foia-request-to-national-archives-about-classified-docs\">obtain</url></emphasis> a records request (and the responsive documents) that President Trump made to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Back in 2023, Trump demanded records that his lawyers claimed would \u201cexpose NARA\u2019s completely different treatment of President Trump from every other president.\u201d (Leopold concluded that the request \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to have unearthed any smoking guns.\u201d)</p><p>It is hard to understand FOIA office layoffs as anything but an intentional effort to obstruct access to public records.</p><p>But to an administration that is hell-bent on defying the rule of law, public accountability is anathema. So, unsurprisingly, the DOGE-led attacks on the civil service have\u2014in some cases specifically\u2014decimated FOIA offices, severely weakening a key tool that helps the public understand what the federal government is doing.</p><p>At the beginning of April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/us-health-agency-mass-firings-begin-as-kennedy-orders-10-000-cut\">laid off</url></emphasis> the entire FOIA office staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He also <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hhs-firings-federal-health-agencies-foia-requests-public-records/\">cut</url></emphasis> FOIA staff significantly at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Following public outcry, RFK Jr. said he would be \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5375065/cdc-hhs-public-records-foia\">restoring all FOIA offices</url></emphasis>\u201d last week, though he failed to provide detail about how or if they plan to recall or replace terminated workers. Call us cynical, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that an administration whose main goal seems to be destruction of the civil service will effectively \u201crestore\u201d even a small segment of that service.</p><p>At places <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-04/trump-filed-foia-request-to-national-archives-about-classified-docs\">like</url></emphasis> USAID, the Department of Education, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where entire agencies have been illegally gutted to the point of nonfunctionality, FOIA offices have apparently not been spared. The Office of Personnel Management has <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html\">laid off</url></emphasis> FOIA staff, and Trump fired the top Department of Justice official <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-justice-dept-fires-head-pardon-office-2025-03-07/\">overseeing</url></emphasis> FOIA administration. The<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Times</emphasis> even <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/foia-office-callout.html\">set up a tip line</url></emphasis> for federal employees to report cuts to FOIA departments.</p><p>It is hard to understand FOIA office layoffs as anything but an intentional effort to obstruct access to public records. Prior to the second Trump administration, FOIA offices already lacked the capacity to consistently process all of the requests they received. A March 2024 analysis of agencies\u2019 chief FOIA officer reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106535.pdf#page=58\">found</url></emphasis> that the single most cited contributor to increasing FOIA backlogs in 2023 was \u201cFOIA staffing losses or turnover,\u201d with over half of responding agencies citing it as a factor. And it wasn\u2019t a trivial factor; the GAO also <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106535.pdf#page=23\">wrote</url></emphasis> that many agency officials \u201cidentified staffing issues as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">among the biggest contributors</emphasis> to backlogs\u201d (emphasis added).</p><p>HHS\u2019s own chief FOIA officer <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hhs.gov/foia/statutes-and-resources/officers-reports/2025-section-5/index.html\">noted</url></emphasis> in the agency\u2019s annual report that there was an increase in the backlog of requests in 2024 in part because of \u201ca loss of key staff\u201d and \u201cstaff turnover.\u201d The report was released on March 10, 2025, just three weeks before Kennedy moved to gut multiple HHS FOIA offices.</p><p>And the attacks on public records go beyond illegal layoffs and office closures. The administration has <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://americanoversight.org/doge-tells-american-oversight-its-records-are-not-subject-to-foia-contradicting-judges-recent-ruling/\">argued</url></emphasis> that DOGE\u2014the very body that facilitated much of the FOIA office-gutting\u2014is exempt from FOIA requests, even though Elon Musk <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856520760656797801\">claimed</url></emphasis> after the election that DOGE would operate with \u201cmaximum transparency.\u201d And Trump himself is threatening to wreck organizations that dare question his actions.</p><p>While the administration staunchly refuses to be \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html\">maximally</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html\"> transparent</url></emphasis>,\u201d groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) are trying to get answers. CREW is currently suing the Trump administration for <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/legal-action/lawsuits/crew-sues-us-doge-service-to-compel-transparency/\">refusing to comply with its FOIA requests</url></emphasis> on DOGE\u2019s activities. To prop up their argument that DOGE and Musk aren\u2019t subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the administration has <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/musk-doge-wont-release-public-records-nonprofit-says/\">claimed that Musk doesn\u2019t work for DOGE</url></emphasis>\u2014despite Trump\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5159062-donald-trump-elon-musk-advice/\">personal posts</url></emphasis> and a basic comprehension of daily news contradicting that idea\u2014and that the roughly 100 <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/doge-staff-attacks-federal-government/\">operatives</url></emphasis> under Musk\u2019s direction are not acting independently from the office of the president.</p><p>So far, CREW has been successful in their challenge\u2014just this month, a district judge issued an opinion <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/news/press-releases/judge-grants-crew-discovery-in-doge-foia-suit/\">requiring DOGE to respond</url></emphasis> to CREW\u2019s questions to determine if DOGE is subject to FOIA, including ordering the deposition of DOGE administrator Amy Gleason. CREW is also suing to <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/legal-action/lawsuits/crew-sues-to-challenge-destruction-of-cdc-foia-office/\">stop the destruction</url></emphasis> of the CDC\u2019s FOIA office, while American Oversight is attempting to stop the <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://americanoversight.org/american-oversight-sues-trump-administration-for-directing-agency-staff-to-shred-and-burn-government-records/\">destruction</url></emphasis> of <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://americanoversight.org/doge-suffers-another-setback-american-oversight-wins-court-order-forcing-preservation-of-records/\">government records</url></emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pogo.org/post/pogo-sues-president-trump-and-doge-over-access-to-records\">other</url></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://democracyforward.org/work/foia-lawsuits/\">groups</url></emphasis> are suing the admin for DOGE\u2019s records. But the efforts have also drawn the ire of the president himself: Two days after the judge\u2019s order in the DOGE FOIA case, Trump <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tax-exempt-crew-environmental-groups-harvard-5e1e0ffacfa040ccdeaf4e43fb72b5fe\">threatened</url></emphasis> to (illegally, for the record) strip CREW of its tax-exempt status.</p><p>This administration\u2019s attack on FOIA staff and the Freedom of Information Act in general will harm the public in ways that will be difficult to directly appreciate for some time. The critical information that we will fail to learn from destroyed and otherwise inaccessible records is, by definition, unknowable. But if past experience is any indication, the gutting of FOIA offices will probably result in more corruption, more public-health crises, and at least according to some people, more civil servants emailing each other the word \u201cdefecate.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMPROS-httpsprospectorgjustice20250501publicrecordswreckers</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMPROS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FPG-S4C3-S1SR-30YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1380\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The American Prospect, Inc.

The change in focus comes in conjunction with the recently passed continuing resolution that addresses transit funds still flowing from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</p><p>According toanalysisby the American Public Transit Association the CR \"provides $20.9 billion for public transit in fiscal year 2025, an increase of $82 million (0.4%) from the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. This total funding represents 95% of the amount authorized in the IIJA.\"</p><p>Federal grants for transit typically require municipalities to provide matching funds that are often leveraged with public financing. The public transit sector has been struggling to recover from the pandemic which put a crimp in farebox revenues.</p><p>\"There has been some recovery in passenger ridership levels across the nation. It varies by region and by system,\" said Kurt Forsgren, managing director, sector lead S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p><p>\"There has been a general recovery, and that's continuing with more return-to-work mandates by employers.\"</p><p>The comments came during panel discussion produced by the Volcker Alliance and the Penn Institute for Urban Research on Tuesday.</p><p>S&amp;P is currently maintaining negative outlooks on three major transit systems, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, Bay Area Rapid Transit and the Chicago Transit Authority.</p><p>\"That means there's a one in three chance that the rate could go down for the next couple of years,\" said Forsgren.</p><p>Leslie Richards, former general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority notes a budget shortfall over $200 million.</p><p>Federal funding freezes are raising concerns in cities designated as sanctuary cities including Chicago, which is awaiting federal funding for a major airport project.</p><p>\"We've got a $12 billion expansion of O'Hare that is just getting underway that's counting on nearly $400 million of federal money that has been committed,\" said David Greising, president and CEO of the Better Government Association.</p><p>\"The one that everybody's watching very closely is the extension of the Chicago Transit Authority's Red Line.\"</p><p>Flat funding levels for transit and increased ridership levels in some markets factor into a transit equation that includes new requirements by the Trump administration.</p><p>\"The administration has frozen funding for some transit projects and just released guidance to review and potentially re-scope or cancel discretionary programs going back as far as 2021 that address climate equity, environmental justice, cycling and electric vehicles if the project sponsors have not yet signed grant agreements and obligated funds,\" said Polly Trottenberg, former DOT Deputy Secretary who served under Secretary Buttigieg.</p><p>\"This is the first time an administration has tried to cancel or re-scope projects en masse that have already been awarded funding through a competitive application process.\"</p><p>\"It adds a new level of uncertainty for a federal surface transportation program that typically operates in somewhat stable ways in five-year cycles of Congressional authorization and funding,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In addition to being the setting for classic myths, labyrinths are also a place where, with each thoughtful step, one can wander and process topics weighing heavily on the mind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UConn Department of Sociology Professor-in-Residence Phoebe Godfrey, Department of Geography, Sustainability, Community and Urban Studies Professor Carol Atkinson-Palombo, and students recently installed a temporary labyrinth on campus to raise awareness for the possibility of a permanent remembrance labyrinth on the Storrs campus. The temporary chalk labyrinth can be found in between the Austin Building and Beach Hall until the next rain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Godfrey is inspired to advocate for a future labyrinth as a place on campus where people can gather, and temporary labyrinths are a great way to share the idea and purpose of the project. \"My classes are all linked to helping students connect more deeply with their bodies, and the Earth as part of their and planetary well-being, and labyrinths are a great way to do this, says Godfrey. Many other schools have built them for similar reasons, including a small one at Eastern Connecticut State University.</p><p>After the success of the buddy bench project, Godfrey connected with UConn's Director of Site Planning and University Landscape Architect Sean Vasington with the idea.</p><p>\"For decades prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and since, health care providers have emphasized the importance of natural and built environments and their influence on our overall health and wellbeing, recommending nature-based programs as one way to help alleviate stress, Vasington says. There is also a strong connection between the quality of the conditions and features of a campus landscape and the mental health of students, including their ability to perform to their full potential academically. UConn is fortunate to have beautiful, open grounds and forests with ample walking paths and communal sitting areas; however it can also benefit from more quiet, reflective spaces within the campus core that connect us to nature. The proposed garden and labyrinth will do just that.</p><p>Godfrey also attended a conference and met with educators at the University of Massachusetts who are working toward building a permanent installation on their campus. The UMass project has been underway for almost 10 years, and was bolstered by a study that suggested that labyrinth walking can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and increase overall satisfaction.</p><p>As with the current labyrinth installation, in Spring 2024 a temporary labyrinth was constructed between the Austin Building and Beach Hall for Earth Day. The installation included a journal for participants to share their thoughts or reflections, and the response was greater than anticipated.</p><p>Godfrey says around 25 people who visited the labyrinth last year wrote in the journal about their positive experiences interacting with the labyrinth.</p><p>\"The diverse and yet collectively positive impact of labyrinths on university students has been documented,\" says Godfrey. \"Positive impacts include mental health and well-being, connecting walkers to a sense of place, sacredness and an ancient practice, and offering opportunities for lessons in contemplation and self-care. These claims were and continue to be supported by our student testimonies.</p><p>Ella Barnett '24 (CLAS) helped with the construction of the labyrinth last spring and came back this year as an alum to help and document this year's labyrinth through photography.</p><p>\"It has been beautiful to watch the labyrinth come to life for the second year in a row. I am grateful that it is able to create a space where individuals have an excuse to connect on the simplest terms, being a human with thought on Earth, says Barnett.</p><p>Eduen Smith '25 (CLAS) also helped construct this spring's labyrinth.</p><p>\"This pop-up labyrinth is linked to a pop-up class from last fall based on the book All We Can Save.' The signs you see at the labyrinth were made by the students in class. They showcase some excerpts from various pieces in the book,\" says Smith. For me, this labyrinth is an example of how our students should be supported. A labyrinth is a simple creation that can impact folx's mental health in profoundly positive ways. It'd also be a great permanent addition to our campus and even help beautify it!\"</p><p>Though the spring installation was created with spray paint, other types of temporary labyrinths can be projected by light, constructed with yarn, or made of canvas or any other material the creative possibilities are endless.</p><p>The potential project was granted space behind Arjona and engineered a few years ago, but to make it happen, Godfrey says, new momentum must be generated by recognizing the value of such ancient practice for our students now and into the future.</p><p>\"The next challenge is to raise funding to complete the design and installation. Based on the success of the previous temporary installation, we hope this Spring installation will continue to build awareness and support for our permanent version,\" says Godfrey.</p><p>When the weather is nice, people gather around Mirror Lake or Swan Lake, and landmarks like the former beloved Swing Tree and the buddy benches serve as areas where people can sit and enjoy the scenery. The labyrinth project's collaborators hope the plan goes forward so the labyrinth can be another place on campus where students can hang out and enjoy the outdoors. In the meantime, to alleviate the end-of-semester stress, spend some time decompressing while you explore the latest temporary labyrinth installation.</p><p>The importance of decompressing and living in the moment is illustrated by a quote from a student who left a reflection of their time in the labyrinth in the journal:</p><p>\"My intention entering the labyrinth was to let go of this sense of hopelessness that has taken over me recently. As I took a stone, I prepared my body to take a breath and begin the walk. As I walked through the labyrinth, I imagined each hopeless thought as a stone that was weighing me down that dropped from my shoulders with every step I took. Finally, as I reached the center of the labyrinth, I placed the stone in the middle, symbolizing my own 'pilgrimage for hope'. I felt connected to the Earth.\"</p><p>As members of UConn's Collaboratory for JUST Innovation and Climate Equity, or JUSTICE, Atkinson-Palombo, Godfrey, and collaborators hope the labyrinth project also serves to highlight the Collaboratory's missions of community building and inter-disciplinary approaches to climate education. JUSTICE brings together faculty and experts from diverse disciplines spanning STEM, social sciences, and the humanities to collaborate on innovative, integrative, and justice-oriented projects and educational opportunities to address the climate crisis.</p><p>In the Fall semester, Atkinson-Palombo and Godfrey collaborated with Kathy Fischer, associate director of the UConn Women's Center, on developing and teaching a course on ecofeminism. The course interfaces with this year's UConn Reads selection, \"All We Can Save,\" edited by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Katharine Wilkinson. Johnson visited UConn at the end of March to celebrate Women's History Month.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127111086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN7-DPN3-RVJ2-538C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from the World Resources Institute by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Incorrect indicators and starting years for emission cumulation can lead to confusion regarding the concepts of climate equity and climate responsibility.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from World Resources Institute: \"This article examines the variations in the results obtained by using different indicators and starting years to calculate climate equity and climate responsibilities among country parties and country groups of the UNFCCC. The article utilizes historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from 193 countries spanning the period 1850 to 2021. The data is aggregated from various sources including EDGAR, Climate Watch, and Global Carbon Budget (GCB). The article calculates cumulative GHG emissions and cumulative GHG emissions per capita, with starting years 1850, 1970, and 1990. By highlighting differences in various indicators, the article aims to provide a better understanding of climate responsibilities, climate beneficiaries, and climate equity. The results demonstrate that cumulative emissions and cumulative emissions per capita are scientific indicators that reveal a country's level of climate responsibility and climate equity.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Negotiators can achieve consensus more easily in the complex system if they have a comprehensive and scientific understanding of climate equity. It is suggested that country groups under the UNFCCC use scientific indicators and methodologies to reveal climate responsibilities and climate equity.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: The Start Matters: A Comparative Analysis of Climate Equity Among UNFCCC Country Parties and Country Groups.

Still, the Harris-Walz vision for an 'Opportunity Economy' maps neatly onto many of the objectives, strategies and policies local governments hold with respect to combating climate change and redressing gaps in racial equity. This post explores the intersections between the Harris-Walz proposals - particularly for housing - and many cities' climate and equity goals, highlighting existing federal policies that cities can lean into and new enabling policies local governments could consider to make the most of the Opportunity Economy. While I write this post in the context of the Harris-Walz proposals, many of the same actions and enabling policies can better position cities to facilitate climate just housing, jobs and local business regardless of who next sits in the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Plan to Build 3 Million Homes</p><p>Housing has been a core animating tenet of the Harris-Walz campaign, especially the topline proposal to build <url normalizedValue=\"https://nhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Harris-Walz-economic-policy-press-release.pdf\">three million new housing units over four years. The Opportunity Economy plan proposes an expansion of the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html#:~:text=Created%20by%20the%20Tax%20Reform,targeted%20to%20lower%2Dincome%20households.\">Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) to 'significantly expand affordable rental supply by more than 1.2 million new affordable homes,' as well as a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to build or rehabilitate owner-occupied homes. Both of those credits would be allocated to states to further apportion to projects (the tax credits themselves are taken by the taxpayer - a developer or homeowner), so local governments will need to work with their states to obtain credits for new housing developments. As with any new or expanded tax credit, Congressional action would be required. The Opportunity Economy plan also proposes a $40 billion fund that would 'provide state and local governments, and private developers and homebuilders, funds to invest in innovative strategies to expand the housing supply,' including reductions in regulatory burden, innovative construction techniques, and 'self-sustaining financing mechanisms to scale new housing construction.' If this fund is enabled by Congress, local governments could have significant flexibility to facilitate housing construction, as the plan states: 'This will be a result-driven innovation fund with one core requirement: state and local governments must show that they will deliver results in building rental properties and that homes are affordable.' These supply-side interventions are proposed alongside up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, likely through tax credits.</url></p><p>The proposals regarding environmentally-friendly construction are less specific, but the Opportunity Economy plan states that 'Harris will continue working to facilitate mass transit-oriented development and energy efficient homes to lower costs.' Since cities play a critical role in facilitating the construction of new homes, they may have latitude to define what this looks like, either at the local level or through federal advocacy. Certain strategies adopted at the local level can help ensure that new homes are built to maximize energy efficiency, electrification, and renewable energy; are resilient to the impacts of extreme weather; and offer residents easy access to non-vehicular modes of travel. Moreover, cities can often play a key role in improving housing affordability in both newly-built and existing units.</p><p>Local Enabling Policies for New, Affordable, Green Housing</p><p>A mix of local, state and federal policy tools will shape how new housing units are built, and cities should take stock now to ensure that proper enabling policies are in place to accommodate new housing and facilitate the greenest and healthiest construction possible. Zoning codes and other land use requirements and plans are good places to start; cities can rezone or remove barriers from existing zoning codes to allow for more housing density, more affordable units, proximity to public and active transportation modes, and ample green space to enhance quality of life and climate resilience. Simple tweaks to zoning rules include the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/18/texas-cities-parking-rules-housing-climate/\">removal of minimum parking requirements (to save developers from spending on parking that the market doesn't demand and to reduce impermeable pavements that exacerbate stormwater issues); allowing for </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6508034&amp;GUID=48E56A92-1C00-47EB-B965-EE5A8E242DE9&amp;FullText=1\">accessory dwelling units or otherwise </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html\">upzoning single family areas to two- or three-family zones; and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2023/10/04/code-changes-aim-to-spark-conversions-to-electric-appliances/\">modifying property line setback requirements that inhibit the installation of exterior insulation, heat pumps, or EV chargers. Other approaches can involve </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.transit.dot.gov/TOD\">transit-oriented development, a named priority in the Opportunity Economy plan; </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://inclusionaryhousing.org/designing-a-policy/land-dedication-incentives/density-bonus/\">height or density bonuses in exchange for </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Office-of-Sustainability-and-Environment/AIRE/Buildings/Green-Building-Incentive-Policy\">green design and/or </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chicago.gov/dam/city/depts/dcd/general/housing/DensityBonusfactswebersion.pdf\">housing affordability; or </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/city-of-yes/city-of-yes-overview.page\">thorough overhauls of a zoning code or land use master plan to prioritize green and affordable housing development. For projects that go through land use review (i.e., that are not as of right), a city might negotiate green construction, stormwater management, green space set-asides, and affordable units into special permits. The goal is to attract housing development in the community through appropriate enabling zoning reforms while ensuring new homes are affordable, resilient to the impacts of climate change, and near to transit, green space, and other amenities.</url></p><p>For local governments with authority, upgrades to local building codes can also help enable the construction of green new residential buildings. Strong building codes are critical to ensuring new homes, which are intended to last for decades, are built to the latest energy standards. In addition to enhanced energy performance requirements, changes to local building codes might include electric-, solar- or EV-readiness; <url normalizedValue=\"https://ctnewsjunkie.com/2024/09/10/massachusetts-cities-are-quickly-embracing-new-emission-slashing-building-code-option/\">all-electric incentives; and structural requirements to </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/6701/resilient-building-codes-toolkit/\">make buildings more resilient to climate impacts. Of course, many local governments lack meaningful local building code authority and would need to work with their states, if the state similarly prioritizes green home construction.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/documents/benchmarking_building_performance_standards_section2.pdf\">Building performance standards and other requirements for existing buildings can help ensure that homes are operated efficiently and with low greenhouse gas emissions once they are constructed. While these measures are largely intended to change enabling conditions at the local level, it is possible that they'll also tie neatly into federal programs meant to spur new housing. In other words, grants, tax credits, and other federal incentives could incentivize or be conditioned on construction to a zero-energy or other advanced code standard.</url></p><p>Finally, cities may wish to undertake efforts to counteract unintended consequences like increases in rent and home prices that push out longtime residents in a process of 'green' gentrification. While the hope is that enough homes are built to counteract the scarcity that can lead to displacement, cost increases can strain budgets in low-income households and force some residents to move out altogether. The proposed Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit is meant to address this concern in part by funding improvements to owner-occupied homes, allowing those owners to build equity and stay in their neighborhoods. For rental homes, local governments will need to work within their state-delegated authority to protect against evictions. Cities could also consider <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/safety-inspections/rent-buy-sell-property/rent-stabilization\">rent stabilization, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://housing2.lacity.org/residents/just-cause-for-eviction-ordinance-jco\">just cause eviction laws, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www8.honolulu.gov/mayor/join-us-rental-and-utility-relief-enrollment-event-in-makiki-for-new-applicants/\">financial assistance to renters, and programs to </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/preserving-affordable-housing-what-works\">preserve existing affordable housing, depending on their state law authority. Some local governments have little authority to enact renter protections, but they may have more latitude to develop zoning or other reforms that prioritize affordability. Combatting rent increases and resident displacement will be a highly place-specific endeavor, but should be considered alongside broad housing reforms from the federal government.</url></p><p>Overlay with Existing Federal Programs</p><p>Regardless of which elements of the Harris-Walz Opportunity Economy make it through Congress or are implementable by executive order, they will complement an existing ecosystem of federal programs seeded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and other recent federal laws. In other words, even if new initiatives do not themselves prioritize energy efficiency, electrification, or renewable energy, they will almost certainly be stackable with grants, rebates, tax credits and lending products that do. By helping stakeholders navigate both landscapes - housing and IRA - cities can promote construction for new housing that is affordable, electric, and energy efficient and retrofits for existing homes to lessen climate impacts, indoor air pollution, and energy bills.</p><p>Some local governments have received grants from federal agencies for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-240-million-new-and-innovative-building-codes\">advanced building codes and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/cprg-selected-applications-sector-buildings\">other building decarbonization projects, as have some </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-325-million-environmental-and-climate\">community-based organizations. Many cities are also still drawing funds from the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/scep/energy-efficiency-and-conservation-block-grant-program\">Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program, monies that can bolster efforts to attract new and renovated green housing within a community - </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/scep/articles/energy-efficiency-and-conservation-block-grant-eligible-activities-and-program\">to tighten residential construction codes and building performance standards, perform residential building energy audits, and develop energy efficiency programs. Cities may wish to assess how efforts funded by federal grants can help position them well for new or upgraded housing. For example, a federal grant might help update energy or emissions performance standards for multifamily properties, develop a market for building retrofit and maintenance workers through upgrades to municipal buildings, or offer funding for direct improvements to residential properties.</url></p><p>The IRA also established two rebate programs available to households for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/scep/home-efficiency-rebates\">investments in energy efficiency and the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/scep/home-electrification-and-appliance-rebates\">purchase of electric appliances. The efficiency rebates offer up to $8,000 per household or housing unit for projects modeled to achieve 15 percent or greater energy savings, with the highest rebate amount reserved for improvements to low-income housing (whether by a homeowner or a residential building owner). The electrification rebates offer low and moderate income households up to $14,000 for the installation of heat pumps, induction stoves, and other electric appliances, as well as for electric panel and wiring upgrades and for weatherization. Each of these rebate programs are or will be run through the states, and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/save/rebates\">only a handful are currently up and running. Rebate programs will continue to come online, and they will be critical to greening many cities' existing housing stock. Local governments will not directly draw on these rebates, but their residents and residential landlords can use them to improve housing quality, indoor air quality, and energy performance within a city.</url></p><p>Certain tax incentives are also available for the construction or renovation of housing that meets energy performance or green building metrics. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/section-45l-tax-credits-zero-energy-ready-homes\">Section 45L tax credit offers housing developers up to $2,500 for new and substantially renovated homes achieving </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energystar.gov/newhomes\">Energy Star certification and up to $5,000 for those that meet the Department of Energy's </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/zero-energy-ready-home-program\">Zero Energy Ready Home standard . The 45L credit is available for manufactured, single-family, and multi-family homes. A tax deduction under </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2024/09/19/a-missed-opportunity-to-decarbonize-municipal-nonprofit-buildings-section-179d-tax-deduction/\">Section 179D of the tax code is also available for whole-building energy efficiency retrofits at multi-family residential buildings of four or more stories. The deduction can cover qualifying appliances and improvements installed as part of a 25 to 50 percent reduction in annual building energy costs as compared to the ASHRAE Reference Standard 90.1 or in energy use intensity as compared to the building's baseline, up to $5.00 per square foot. These tax incentives can overlay not only any newly applicable tax credits and other programs adopted under the Opportunity Economy plan, but also existing housing tax credits like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Other existing tax credits include one for </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits#homeowners\">individual households to defray costs for energy efficiency improvements, heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters and the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/federal-solar-tax-credits-businesses#_edn1%22\">business and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics\">residential investment tax credits for rooftop solar and storage. While local governments will not generally not use any of these incentives directly, they can be directed to developers and residents to support green home construction and retrofits.</url></p><p>In addition to rebates and tax incentives, the IRA's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund\">Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) provided $20 billion in capitalization and start-up assistance for a national network of green finance institutions. The </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-billion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and\">eight direct grantees under the GGRF program are still developing their programs and loan product offerings, but there are some early hints as to how they can support new and retrofitted green homes. One grantee, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://powerforwardcommunities.org/\">Power Forward Communities, will offer '</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1014573/x/61a57e9fd0/power-forward-communities-frequently-asked-questions.pdf?cv=1712224912764\">online tools, consumer education, and a network for contractors to streamline household decarbonization, weatherization, and other remediation efforts [along] with new low-interest financing products and community grants' (exact offerings will vary by geography). Under another GGRF program, the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/clean-communities-investment-accelerator\">Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, the EPA chose five awardees that will use their grants to capitalize the balance sheets of </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdfifund.gov/\">Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), credit unions, and other community lenders in cities across the country. Details remain sparse at this time, but community lenders can use that capital to offer loan products and services that advance housing decarbonization such as green mortgages, retrofit loans with payback terms that mirror energy savings over time, and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/scep/slsc/property-assessed-clean-energy-programs\">property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing. Unless they own or are developing housing, cities may not use these particular offerings themselves, but an understanding of the landscape can help steer the capital needed to build and retrofit clean, healthy housing in the community.</url></p><p>Complementary Elements of the Opportunity Economy: Small Businesses and Jobs</p><p>This post focuses on the Harris-Walz plans for housing, but the Opportunity Economy also outlines significant policy proposals meant to spur job creation and entrepreneurship. Each of these can help enhance local capacity to build, retrofit, and maintain homes that are efficient, electric, renewable-powered and resilient to climate impacts.</p><p>The entrepreneurship proposals in particular could help build out a green homes workforce, with many service providers run locally by residents who might otherwise be shut out of business ownership. One strategy would allow new businesses to deduct $50,000 in start-up business expenses (up from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/195\">the current $5,000 tax deduction), and to delay taking that deduction until a future tax year when they might have a profit. The Opportunity Economy plan also proposes allocating one-third of federal contracting dollars to small businesses, with a particular focus on 'rural and other underserved small businesses,' allowing entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. It also suggests a 'small business expansion fund' that would work with CDFIs to offer low-cost loans to growing small businesses, as well as the expansion of the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/small-business-programs/state-small-business-credit-initiative-ssbci\">State Small Business Credit Initiative, which helps spur financing and venture capital investments.</url></p><p>Cities might consider how to offer complementary supports to new businesses that can build green homes, perform energy and electrification retrofits, install and services electric appliances, solar panels, and energy storage, and more. If the Opportunity Economy plan is implemented as written, it will likely incentivize movement in this direction, as it promises to 'leverag[e] federal funding' to 'encourage states and local governments to reduce burdensome regulations for small businesses, [including] expedited review of building, public way, and health permit applications.' The Opportunity Economy plan also proposes funding 'a network of new and existing federal, state, local, and private business incubators, and small business innovation hubs' providing technical assistance; connections to capital, customers, and contracts; and funding. It's possible that cities could themselves establish and run one of these incubators or hubs, or that they could create the conditions for another entity to do so within the community. Where appropriate, local governments can work to get new businesses enrolled in minority and women owned-business enterprise programs to better position them for local, state, and federal contracts. The Opportunity Economy plan also looks to create new jobs through a new 'America Forward' tax credit. Details on this credit are presently sparse, but the proposal includes a focus on jobs in 'clean energy manufacturing and innovation,' and for investments in energy communities, a term defined under the IRA as areas in which unemployment is higher than average or in which coal mines or coal-fired power plants have closed in recent decades. While many details remain to be ironed out, cities will create the enabling conditions to attract new manufacturing facilities, office campuses, and other job centers.</p><p>Federal Advocacy</p><p>In a scenario where Congress is able to enact reconciliation or appropriations legislation that advances the Opportunity Economy plan, local governments motivated to advocate on climate should, with their various associations, consider how to connect climate efforts to the Harris-Walz housing proposals. Tax incentives are a common reconciliation tool (they comprise the largest forecasted spend in the IRA), and, as discussed above, the Harris-Walz plan outlines several of them. Cities might advocate for these new housing tax incentives to be conditioned on the claimant weatherizing the home, completing an energy audit, or meeting some more advanced environmental standard. Beyond this, cities might also advocate for expansion of existing tax programs. For example, the 45L tax credit could be expanded to offer more money for Energy Star and DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes, and some groups have started advocating for an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facilitiesdive.com/news/energy-efficiency-tax-credits-could-support-commercial-real-estate-sector/728198/#:~:text=The%20EE%2DITC%20provides%20a,apprenticeship%20requirements%20aren&amp;apos;t%20met.\">energy efficiency investment tax credit that would provide an effective rebate for residential building improvements. All new and expanded tax credits would ideally be made eligible for elective pay so that nonprofit (and if applicable public) landlords and housing developers could benefit. Outside of tax credits, local governments can advocate for extended or expanded grant programs, particularly EECBG, which has been re-upped several times in the past and which is available for a range of uses.</url></p><p>Moving Forward</p><p>It's likely that we won't know the results of the presidential election until late next week or beyond. If the Harris-Walz ticket is successful, the transition team's efforts to equip the incoming administration and advance the Opportunity Economy plan will accelerate sharply. There are many ways cities can align their efforts, including assessing whether their policies enable an influx of new, green housing and how new businesses and jobs might take root within the community; continuing to implement existing federal policy; and preparing to advocate for local climate priorities in federal housing legislation. This work will be worthwhile regardless of electoral outcomes - while a Trump administration will have different priorities than a Harris administration, a local government's work to establish the right enabling conditions to attract new, affordable, green housing can have that effect (albeit a lesser one) even without federal support. Cities stand to move their priorities forward by laying the groundwork for an increase in climate-friendly and affordable housing, whether or not their work is reinforced by a strong federal partner in the coming presidential administration.</p><p>Amy Turner is the Director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-SCCC1000816153134024782025211300074</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D9X-PXH1-F03R-N137-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567518</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3345\"/><timeReceived>3:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Administrator Zeldin is calling for termination of the financial agent agreement, and for the immediate return of the entire fund balance to the United States Treasury to ensure EPA oversight. Administrator Zeldin also announced that he will be referring this matter to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and Congress, and the agency will work with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p><p>\"Roughly twenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight,\" said Administrator Zeldin.</p><p>\"One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse,\" continued Administrator Zeldin. \"We will review every penny that has gone out the door. The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\"</p><p>Two months ago, a video circulated on social media featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about \"tossing gold bars off the titanic,\" intentionally rushing to get billions of tax dollars recklessly out of the agency before Inauguration Day. During Administrator Zeldin's confirmation hearing, he committed to ensuring he would work hard to research and account for every dollar spent at EPA, not only during his tenure, but also from the last administration.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-billions-dollars-worth-gold-bars-have-been-located\">https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-billions-dollars-worth-gold-bars-have-been-located</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9056558 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9056558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F52-R823-RVPW-V1VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"385\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 15, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Naperville Public Utilities Advisory Board recommended last month that the city approve the extension.</p><p>But the matter was not included on the May 6 City Councilmeeting agenda, and LaCloche confirmed on Monday that the City Council did not plan to take up the contract extension Tuesday.</p><p>The IMEA is a 32-member unit of local government composed of municipal electric systems from across Illinois. Twenty-seven of those members have already agreed to contract renewals, according to theAmerican Public Power Association.</p><p>\"If IMEA lost Naperville as a participant, it would be negative for IMEA's credit profile,\" said Gayle Podurgiel, vice president-senior analyst at Moody's Ratings, which affirmed the IMEA's A1 revenue bond ratings and stable outlookin January.</p><p>\"Naperville is IMEA's largest member, representing about 34% of energy usage in fiscal 2024, and the city of Naperville's Aaa GO rating is a supportive factor for IMEA's A1 credit rating,\" she added.</p><p>Podurgiel noted that the IMEA's outstanding debt will fully amortize by February 2035, so changes to its membership beyond 2035 don't affect current ratings.</p><p>St. Charles, the IMEA's second-largest member for power use, has not yet signed a contract extension, nor have Winnetka, Cairo or Fairfield, according to a May 1memo to the Naperville city managerfrom Naperville Electric Utility Director Brian Groth.</p><p>Groth said at the April 23 and 24 IMEA board meetings, the nonprofit's staff recommended the board extend the open offer period for the members that have yet to sign extensions. But some members who had already signed contract extensions called for terminating the open offer period or implementing a progressive premium structure for any member that fails to sign an extension during the period.</p><p>Ultimately, \"many board members asked IMEA staff to begin preparing a resolution for the board to vote on at its June 2025 board meeting to extend the existing contract offer until the IMEA August 21, 2025, board meeting,\" Groth wrote.</p><p>\"Whether a member city can miss the deadline and later participate beyond 2035 will have to be a future decision of the IMEA board,\" said Staci Wilson, vice president of government affairs and member services for IMEA.</p><p>A grassroots advocacy group,Clean Energy Alliance of Naperville, has mobilized citizens against the 30-year contract renewal that IMEA is seeking from all its members, including Naperville.</p><p>According to the group, the IMEA generates nearly 80% of its power through coal - 49% of it from Prairie State, and 29% from a coal-fired plant in Trimble County, Kentucky. The alliance did not respond to a request for comment by press time.</p><p>Prairie State emitted 12.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, according to theEnvironmental Law and Policy Center, a Chicago-based environmental legal advocacy group.</p><p>The plant'sstartup was rocky, with cost overruns that drove up the cost of energy for utility customers.</p><p>Since taking office, the Trump administration has issued several executive orders favoring coal-fired generation, including anApril 8 orderdeclaring coal \"essential to our national and economic security.\"</p><p>The order designates coal a mineral, which among other things means it's included in an order directing federal agencies to expedite the issuance of permits for minerals projects.</p><p>The administration has also excluded battery storage, solar and wind power fromits definition of \"energy\"and relaxed the mercury and air toxic pollution standards, which will exempt coal plants from equipment maintenance and upgrade requirements, according to theNatural Resources Defense Council.</p><p>\"What we're finding is that, for many expensive projects\" there's a wait-and-see approach, regardless of whether we're talking about fossil fuel projects or renewable projects,\" said Pamela Goodwin, co-chair of the environmental practice at Saul Ewing, a Philadelphia-based law firm with 18 offices across the U.S.</p><p>The uncertainty around federal policy is creating a legal patchwork, with local governments, utilities and developers struggling to balance state priorities with the expressed objectives of the Trump administration.</p><p>\"People are being very cautious in trying to determine what the implications are of the federal government's priorities, and how those compare and contrast to the various states in which one might be planning to develop a project,\" Goodwin said.</p><p>She said some of the new regulations coming out of the White House will allow coal facilities to continue to operate longer than they might otherwise have done.</p><p>\"What that means is that for the coal industry, we're not seeing any new coal power plants being built, and I don't anticipate that we will,\" she said. \"Investors aren't looking to reinvent their wheel with coal. The question is, can we extend the life of existing coal facilities? Many of them had already been targeted for deactivation.</p><p>\"It depends where they are in the life cycle as to whether an operator or a developer would have an interest in continuing to keep the facility going,\" she added. \"Many of them have already been scheduled for transition - for example, to gas.\"</p><p>Moody's in Januarynoted \"the significant coal exposure that IMEA has\" and the fact that it drew only 10% of its energy from renewable power in fiscal 2024.</p><p>However, Moody's pointed to IMEA's favorable take-and-pay member contracts that include a five-year termination notice, and an accelerated debt amortization profile that hastens debt repayment.</p><p>Fitch Ratingsassigns a AA-minus ratingto the planned Series 2025A issue. On April 29 it affirmed the same rating on the IMEA's $644 million of power supply revenue bonds, Series 2009C, 2010A and 2015A. The outlook is stable.</p><p>Fitch cited strong revenue defensibility due to the take-and-pay contracts, the IMEA's independent legal authority to raise rates and its largest members' strong credit quality.</p><p>The rating agency said it factored into the rating Illinois' Climate Equity and Jobs Act, which aims to significantly curb carbon emissions by 2038 and targets net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>\"Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation,\" Fitch said.</p><p>The rating agency did consider the credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles in rating the IMEA's debt. But the potential loss of Naperville would not impact the rating because the 2035 expiration of the city's contract coincides with the maturity of IMEA's outstanding debt, said Jeff Wark, a Fitch director for U.S. public finance and public power.</p><p>The refunding issuance will match the original maturities of the bonds to be refunded, Fitch said.</p><p>Wark declined to comment on the implications for coal-reliant issuers like IMEA of potential changes to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency power plant standards that require sharp reductions by 2032 in carbon emissions from coal-fired plants.</p><p>\"It's difficult to predict what changes may, or may not, come from the new administration with respect to future EPA guidelines on carbon emissions,\" he said.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Ratings affirmed its A long-term rating and underlying rating on the IMEA's revenue bonds in October 2023. The outlook is stable.</p><p>\"We do think that Naperville is one of the stronger members of IMEA, so if Naperville were to leave membership, that would likely be a credit negative from our perspective,\" S&amp;P Associate Director Tim Meernik said. \"One of the things that we'll be looking at is, Naperville is responsible for about one third of the IMEA's energy sales, so how does IMEA respond\" with its power supply portfolio?</p><p>\"Basically, it complicates their power supply planning,\" he said. The IMEA would need to rebalance its contracts if one of its largest members leaves.</p><p>\"It's a matter of matching supply and demand,\" said S&amp;P Director Jeff Panger. \"With uncertainty related to Naperville and others\" it limits the choices that the joint action agency has in being able to address their future power supply plans.</p><p>\"This is true for all joint action agencies,\" he added. \"We look to see that the debt maturities are in line with the member contracts. If you don't have people to buy your power, and you have debt coming due, that's a problem for credit. So we want to see that there's a match between power supply and demand.\"</p><p>Panger said the law that governs the emissions of Prairie State will be Illinois' CEJA, until something else is passed. \"We rate to what the law is, not the back-and-forth on this,\" he said of the debate over environmental regulations and Trump's executive orders.</p><p>\"We realize that there's a lot of fluidity right now, and we continue to monitor the changes,\" Meernik added. \"We haven't seen anything definitive to change our view that over the long term, IMEA remains exposed\" to financial and operational challenges from its reliance on coal.</p><p>Saul Ewing's Goodwin said most of the changes at the federal level have been through executive orders, and those are not really fully implemented. The question the energy industry is asking, she said, is what can get financed?</p><p>\"I suppose the right existing and not terribly old coal-fired power plant might be a candidate for interim financing to do some upgrade work and things of that nature,\" she said.</p><p>She noted that nuclear energy is generating a lot of buzz today, but those projects have long timelines. And she predicted that even with the Trump administration's orders, coal usage will decrease by about 5% in 2025, and by another 20% in total between 2025 and 2029.</p><p>\"What kind of energy operations are going to get the confidence and the backing of the major investors? I think most of that is going to go to natural gas,\" Goodwin added.</p><p>IMEA Board of Directors Chairman Cory Sheehy did not respond to requests for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BONDBY-00000196a61ddaa1a3f6b7bd57ab000136303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BONDBY,bondbuyer_new2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRX-DF73-RV1P-J2R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303185</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bond Buyer</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 397</volume><issueNumber>No. 36303</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/imea-faces-contract-challenges-over-coal-generation\">https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/imea-faces-contract-challenges-over-coal-generation</url><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 8, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000197</classCode><className>BOND MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000198</classCode><className>BONDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp;

The Naperville Public Utilities Advisory Board recommended last month that the city approve the extension.</p><p>But the matter was not included on the May 6 City Councilmeeting agenda, and LaCloche confirmed on Monday that the City Council did not plan to take up the contract extension Tuesday.</p><p>The IMEA is a 32-member unit of local government composed of municipal electric systems from across Illinois. Twenty-seven of those members have already agreed to contract renewals, according to theAmerican Public Power Association.</p><p>\"If IMEA lost Naperville as a participant, it would be negative for IMEA's credit profile,\" said Gayle Podurgiel, vice president-senior analyst at Moody's Ratings, which affirmed the IMEA's A1 revenue bond ratings and stable outlookin January.</p><p>\"Naperville is IMEA's largest member, representing about 34% of energy usage in fiscal 2024, and the city of Naperville's Aaa GO rating is a supportive factor for IMEA's A1 credit rating,\" she added.</p><p>Podurgiel noted that the IMEA's outstanding debt will fully amortize by February 2035, so changes to its membership beyond 2035 don't affect current ratings.</p><p>St. Charles, the IMEA's second-largest member for power use, has not yet signed a contract extension, nor have Winnetka, Cairo or Fairfield, according to a May 1memo to the Naperville city managerfrom Naperville Electric Utility Director Brian Groth.</p><p>Groth said at the April 23 and 24 IMEA board meetings, the nonprofit's staff recommended the board extend the open offer period for the members that have yet to sign extensions. But some members who had already signed contract extensions called for terminating the open offer period or implementing a progressive premium structure for any member that fails to sign an extension during the period.</p><p>Ultimately, \"many board members asked IMEA staff to begin preparing a resolution for the board to vote on at its June 2025 board meeting to extend the existing contract offer until the IMEA August 21, 2025, board meeting,\" Groth wrote.</p><p>\"Whether a member city can miss the deadline and later participate beyond 2035 will have to be a future decision of the IMEA board,\" said Staci Wilson, vice president of government affairs and member services for IMEA.</p><p>A grassroots advocacy group,Clean Energy Alliance of Naperville, has mobilized citizens against the 30-year contract renewal that IMEA is seeking from all its members, including Naperville.</p><p>According to the group, the IMEA generates nearly 80% of its power through coal - 49% of it from Prairie State, and 29% from a coal-fired plant in Trimble County, Kentucky. The alliance did not respond to a request for comment by press time.</p><p>Prairie State emitted 12.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, according to theEnvironmental Law and Policy Center, a Chicago-based environmental legal advocacy group.</p><p>The plant'sstartup was rocky, with cost overruns that drove up the cost of energy for utility customers.</p><p>Since taking office, the Trump administration has issued several executive orders favoring coal-fired generation, including anApril 8 orderdeclaring coal \"essential to our national and economic security.\"</p><p>The order designates coal a mineral, which among other things means it's included in an order directing federal agencies to expedite the issuance of permits for minerals projects.</p><p>The administration has also excluded battery storage, solar and wind power fromits definition of \"energy\"and relaxed the mercury and air toxic pollution standards, which will exempt coal plants from equipment maintenance and upgrade requirements, according to theNatural Resources Defense Council.</p><p>\"What we're finding is that, for many expensive projects\" there's a wait-and-see approach, regardless of whether we're talking about fossil fuel projects or renewable projects,\" said Pamela Goodwin, co-chair of the environmental practice at Saul Ewing, a Philadelphia-based law firm with 18 offices across the U.S.</p><p>The uncertainty around federal policy is creating a legal patchwork, with local governments, utilities and developers struggling to balance state priorities with the expressed objectives of the Trump administration.</p><p>\"People are being very cautious in trying to determine what the implications are of the federal government's priorities, and how those compare and contrast to the various states in which one might be planning to develop a project,\" Goodwin said.</p><p>She said some of the new regulations coming out of the White House will allow coal facilities to continue to operate longer than they might otherwise have done.</p><p>\"What that means is that for the coal industry, we're not seeing any new coal power plants being built, and I don't anticipate that we will,\" she said. \"Investors aren't looking to reinvent their wheel with coal. The question is, can we extend the life of existing coal facilities? Many of them had already been targeted for deactivation.</p><p>\"It depends where they are in the life cycle as to whether an operator or a developer would have an interest in continuing to keep the facility going,\" she added. \"Many of them have already been scheduled for transition - for example, to gas.\"</p><p>Moody's in Januarynoted \"the significant coal exposure that IMEA has\" and the fact that it drew only 10% of its energy from renewable power in fiscal 2024.</p><p>However, Moody's pointed to IMEA's favorable take-and-pay member contracts that include a five-year termination notice, and an accelerated debt amortization profile that hastens debt repayment.</p><p>Fitch Ratingsassigns a AA-minus ratingto the planned Series 2025A issue. On April 29 it affirmed the same rating on the IMEA's $644 million of power supply revenue bonds, Series 2009C, 2010A and 2015A. The outlook is stable.</p><p>Fitch cited strong revenue defensibility due to the take-and-pay contracts, the IMEA's independent legal authority to raise rates and its largest members' strong credit quality.</p><p>The rating agency said it factored into the rating Illinois' Climate Equity and Jobs Act, which aims to significantly curb carbon emissions by 2038 and targets net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>\"Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation,\" Fitch said.</p><p>The rating agency did consider the credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles in rating the IMEA's debt. But the potential loss of Naperville would not impact the rating because the 2035 expiration of the city's contract coincides with the maturity of IMEA's outstanding debt, said Jeff Wark, a Fitch director for U.S. public finance and public power.</p><p>The refunding issuance will match the original maturities of the bonds to be refunded, Fitch said.</p><p>Wark declined to comment on the implications for coal-reliant issuers like IMEA of potential changes to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency power plant standards that require sharp reductions by 2032 in carbon emissions from coal-fired plants.</p><p>\"It's difficult to predict what changes may, or may not, come from the new administration with respect to future EPA guidelines on carbon emissions,\" he said.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Ratings affirmed its A long-term rating and underlying rating on the IMEA's revenue bonds in October 2023. The outlook is stable.</p><p>\"We do think that Naperville is one of the stronger members of IMEA, so if Naperville were to leave membership, that would likely be a credit negative from our perspective,\" S&amp;P Associate Director Tim Meernik said. \"One of the things that we'll be looking at is, Naperville is responsible for about one third of the IMEA's energy sales, so how does IMEA respond\" with its power supply portfolio?</p><p>\"Basically, it complicates their power supply planning,\" he said. The IMEA would need to rebalance its contracts if one of its largest members leaves.</p><p>\"It's a matter of matching supply and demand,\" said S&amp;P Director Jeff Panger. \"With uncertainty related to Naperville and others\" it limits the choices that the joint action agency has in being able to address their future power supply plans.</p><p>\"This is true for all joint action agencies,\" he added. \"We look to see that the debt maturities are in line with the member contracts. If you don't have people to buy your power, and you have debt coming due, that's a problem for credit. So we want to see that there's a match between power supply and demand.\"</p><p>Panger said the law that governs the emissions of Prairie State will be Illinois' CEJA, until something else is passed. \"We rate to what the law is, not the back-and-forth on this,\" he said of the debate over environmental regulations and Trump's executive orders.</p><p>\"We realize that there's a lot of fluidity right now, and we continue to monitor the changes,\" Meernik added. \"We haven't seen anything definitive to change our view that over the long term, IMEA remains exposed\" to financial and operational challenges from its reliance on coal.</p><p>Saul Ewing's Goodwin said most of the changes at the federal level have been through executive orders, and those are not really fully implemented. The question the energy industry is asking, she said, is what can get financed?</p><p>\"I suppose the right existing and not terribly old coal-fired power plant might be a candidate for interim financing to do some upgrade work and things of that nature,\" she said.</p><p>She noted that nuclear energy is generating a lot of buzz today, but those projects have long timelines.

Instead, the House bill would support industrial agriculture practices that have no proven benefits to the climate, such as increasing price supports for industrial commodity crops.</p><p>While the chairman's proposal does include a few positive provisions--such as support for resolving the land ownership issues that especially impact Black, Indigenous and other farmers of color - these do not offset the bill's many problems. It fails to offer meaningful protection for the workers who keep the country's food and farm system running, or to consider USDA Equity Commission recommendations to address discrimination at the agency and ensure farming is accessible to all.</p><p>In addition, the bill would restrict how Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may be updated, limiting science-based changes to the Thrifty Food Plan and therefore preventing benefits from being adjusted to reflect the cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific or dietary guidelines.</p><p>Representative Thompson's proposal flies in the face of clear public support for programs that make farmers more resilient, protect food and farm workers, and help people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. The chairman recently called for a 'tripartisan' farm bill--highlighting his motivation to cater to corporate agribusiness as the third party--and this proposal reflects that. New UCS research found that agribusinesses, industry groups and others have spent more than half a billion dollars over the last five years lobbying on issues that include the next food and farm bill and donated $3.4 million dollars to the campaign coffers of three key food and farm bill architects, including Thompson.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at UCS:</p><p>\"The House food and farm bill would eliminate critical guardrails that ensure Inflation Reduction Act conservation investments make farmers part of the climate solution. Farmers are increasingly impacted by severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding. Any final food and farm bill must include support for programs that help farmers adapt to a changing climate while also reducing agricultural emissions that are driving the climate crisis. Climate-focused conservation funding is essential to help farmers make their farms more resilient and must remain designated for this purpose.</p><p>\"The bill is out of line with what the public wants and our food system needs. People across the country strongly support programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. They also support protecting the workers who keep our country fed and want to ensure that small-scale, diverse and young farmers have equitable access to land, credit, and other vital resources. The House bill fails in these respects.</p><p>\"The food and farm bill provides an opportunity to build a more resilient, sustainable, just and equitable food and farm system, for all of us. As it stands, this bill is unacceptable. We urge the House Agriculture Committee to reject this legislation. Congress can and must do better.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/house-farm-bill-proposal-undermines-climate-equity\">https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/house-farm-bill-proposal-undermines-climate-equity</url></p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8633117 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8633117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C29-2VX1-JC11-14FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><timeReceived>11:47 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 18, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Hurricanes Helene and Milton, striking just days before the workshop, caused $300 billion in damages across seven states and claimed more than 250 lives. The devastation underscored an urgent need for improved disaster modeling, from engineering and infrastructure to supply chain resilience and social support networks.</p><p>\"Better modeling means better preparedness,\" said Dr. Paolo Bocchini, Director of the Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience. \"The rapid intensification of both storms is a worrisome signal, one of the many signals calling attention to this problem. We need to unite the next generation of researchers in engineering, natural hazard science, climate science, and the social science of disasters to understand today better so we can prepare for tomorrow.\"</p><p>The Center addresses the impacts of various catastrophic events, including wildfires, pandemics, floods, and earthquakes. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Center seeks to modernize catastrophe modeling through an interdisciplinary approach that integrates historical data with cutting-edge analytics.</p><p>Lehigh's Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience is unique in offering the nation's only graduate-level program dedicated to training experts in catastrophe modeling. Its collaborative framework involves academia, government agencies, and private sector stakeholders, aiming to empower communities with the tools and knowledge to mitigate disaster risks effectively.</p><p>\"Our work brings together engineering, climatology, earth sciences, and sociology to connect the dots between the causes and outcomes of tomorrow's catastrophes,\" Bocchini explained. \"The questions we've received in recent weeks highlight both fear and an opportunity for solutions.\"</p><p>The workshop, along with the Center's broader initiatives, focuses on integrating multi-scale, multi-hazard, and multi-physics modeling to help communities better prepare for climatological and biological disasters.</p><p>ResearchWorkshop on Climate, Equity, and Resilience in Catastrophe Modeling</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202411252135042747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DH5-8S91-JC3D-Y2NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 25, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>LEHIGH UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>center-for-catastrophe-modeling-advances-disaster-preparedness-solutions</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Of note is Executive Order 14219, which requires reviewing all regulations subject to an agency's jurisdiction for 'consistency with law and administration policy' and identifying 'regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of the underlying statutory authority or prohibition.' Accordingly, EPA is conducting a review of its rules, including promulgated by [EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention] to implement [the Toxic Substances Control Act]. OCSPP has determined that the 2024 Rule at issue in this petition for review should be reconsidered through further rulemaking. Accordingly, EPA, by and through OCSPP, believes that remand of this action for further reconsideration is appropriate and necessary to effective implementation of its TSCA program.\" -- Nancy Beck, EPA's newly appointed deputy chemicals chief, in a statement supporting remand of a TSCA-connected suit while the agency reconsiders Biden EPA rules for evaluating and regulating chemicals.</p><p>With funding freeze lifted, EPA orders A-to-Z review of grants and awards: \"[EPA officials] shall immediately initiate and conduct an internal review of all relevant grant programs, grant awards, grants that have not yet been awarded and obligated to specific individuals or entities (e.g., notices of funding opportunities), and issued grants. This includes a review of payments on all grant programs and awards where agency personnel suspect that the grant is unlawful or contrary to agency policy priorities, or suspect that the grant program implementation or payment might be fraudulent, abusive, duplicative, or implemented in a way that failed to safeguard agency dollars.\" -- The EPA order follows a court order temporarily lifting the administration's broad funding freeze, and, separately, the agency issued a requirement that all future spending elements greater than $50,000 would require Department of Government Efficiency approval.</p><p>GAO advises that CRA doesn't apply to Biden California waivers: \". . .Our view is that our prior analysis and [2023] conclusion . . . that the Advanced Clean Car Program Waiver Notice was not a rule for [the Congressional Review Act] because it was an order under [the Administrative Procedure Act] would apply to the three notices at issue here. We provide this information to assist Congress as it considers how to treat these Notices of Decision and the application of CRA procedures.\" -- The Government Accountability Office, in a March 6 letter responding to questions from Senate Democrats, says the CRA and its rescission authorities do not apply to the Biden administration preemption waivers for California vehicle emissions programs, an opinion similar to one it previously delivered in 2023 to Senate Republicans.</p><p>EPA GHG strategy may downplay worldwide benefits of U.S. cuts: \"I believe the climate is changing. . . . [But] EPA must always carefully analyze all matters before it to make sure they are firmly grounded in statutory authority, are sound policy, and are based on a robust evidentiary record . . . cannot speak to generally what the specific impacts would be from fossil fuel, but carbon dioxide in combination with other greenhouse gases can result in heat being trapped in the atmosphere. . . .We have significantly decreased both our GHG and traditional air pollution emissions, especially over the past 20 years, while other countries such as China have significantly increased [theirs]. . . . If we shut off all GHG emissions in this country tomorrow, that would not have any real impact with the increase we have seen from other countries.\" -- EPA's nominee to become air chief, Aaron Szabo, at his confirmation hearing on assorted climate change issues as the agency considers scrapping the \"endangerment finding\" that underpins agency actions limiting climate change.</p><p>Zeldin: ending 'self-dealing and wasteful spending' grants: \"The days of 'throwing gold bars off the Titanic' are over. The well documented incidents of misconduct, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud raise significant concerns and pose unacceptable risk. I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending. EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars dedicated to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of 'climate equity.'\" -- EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, announcing the end of the agency's multi-billion-dollar Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EPADLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EPADLY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB1-Y4X3-SJM2-30GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Briefing</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 13, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgxNkZFOTFCNTc0NEJGRkI4NjFFMkI4QjNGOTIwQkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkMwQ0ZDQjRBQjk2NEE3OUI5QTQ5MThFMUE0N0Q4ODU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVBRkUwQTA0NDY3NDI3MkEwODI3RTY3MEZCOEI3REQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUFFOUVFN0QyOEY2NDM0QjlDNTBFRTFERkFFMTA1Njk</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjYyRTk3QUVFRjk4NDVGMkI0REI0NDA4NTUzRDY5NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk0RkJCOUQ5NEFCNDE2N0EzRUE0QzU2RUFBOEEzRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Business &amp;

Austin Transit Partnership, which oversees the project, released a Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Jan. 10, reviewing how the project would interact with the urban and natural environment. The 9.8-mile light rail is expected to improve mobility and decrease travel time in high-traffic corridors such as Guadalupe and Lavaca streets, South Congress Avenue and East Riverside Drive, according to the report.</p><p>The light rail is a key part of the city's localized response to climate change and supports the 2040 Austin Climate Equity Plan, which is directed at mitigating future environmental risks while acknowledging past harm.\u00a0</p><p>Environmental engineering senior Suveda Sannidhi said it is important to consider the short-term and long-term impacts of infrastructure projects within local communities.\u00a0</p><p>\"We live in a society that is so car-dominated,\" Sannidhi said. \"Any transition to public transportation or a shared rail system is beneficial to our progress that we're making, but in that process, we do still have to consider the communities that are being served.\"</p><p>Transit access and equity, which the commissioners analyzed heavily in the report, was of particular concern for communities in East Austin who were \"harmed by past discriminatory practices.\"\u00a0</p><p>Commissioner Richard Brimer said a historic example was the 1928 City Plan, or the 1928 Master Plan, which forced minority communities to move to the east side of Austin. The divide solidified after the city constructed Interstate 35 adjacent to East Avenue in 1962.\u00a0</p><p>With increased connectivity to destinations including UT, downtown and Lady Bird Lake, the partnership intends to make public transit an \"attractive alternative\" to driving. Planners estimate the light rail could support around 29,000 trips each weekday.\u00a0</p><p>Across the United States, transportation accounts for 28% of all greenhouse gases emitted in the country, more than any other category, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Pollutants released into the air from gasoline-powered vehicles can negatively impact health, according to the EPA. The light rail would remove approximately 1,061 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, according to partnership estimates.\u00a0</p><p>Austin Energy will supply the power for the light rail trains, according to the report. While Austin Energy still maintains some energy generation sources that produce greenhouse gas emissions, the utility plans to move to all carbon-free sources by 2035.\u00a0</p><p>\"The potential emission reductions will greatly outweigh any long-term operational (greenhouse gas) emissions since the system will be using renewable, carbon-free sources in the long term,\" said C. Tyler Dick, an assistant professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering with expertise in transportation engineering, in an email.</p><p>Dick said the numbers are difficult to put into context, as the light rail project would reduce daily vehicle miles traveled in Austin by less than 0.1%. Transportation-related emissions, greenhouse gases and other pollutants in Austin could be expected to decrease by a similar 0.1%, he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"The light rail project will not decrease truck traffic through Austin, and it is heavy trucks that produce a disproportionate share of emission per vehicle-mile traveled,\" Dick said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6101900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F9D-Y0N3-RV9X-71XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Texan: University of Texas - Austin</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 7, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000834W</classCode><className>BEST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BEST (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Austin</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>TX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Business &amp;

Authored by Natalia Renta with research support from Meron Lemmi, and edited by Patrick Woodall, Lisa Donner, and Alex Martin, the report details how a burgeoning anti-ESG (environmental, social, governance) campaign--backed by fossil fuel and corporate interests--aims to dismantle pensions' ability to safeguard $5.3 trillion in assets for 12 million retirees and 14.9 million workers. It offers states a battle plan to counter these attacks and secure retirement funds vital to local economies.</p><p>The report frames public pensions as economic linchpins, distributing $334 billion annually and supporting 3.7 million jobs, $710 billion in output, and $86 billion in taxes. Yet, it warns of a federal onslaught expected under a new Trump administration and Republican Congress, echoing Project 2025's deregulatory blueprint and prior House bills like H.R. 5339. These moves threaten to reverse Biden-era rules allowing pensions to weigh environmental and social factors, replacing them with restrictive 2020 Trump-era limits. Anti-ESG efforts, already enacted in 17 states via 19 laws, cast doubt on considering climate risks--projected to devalue real estate by $121-$237 billion--or social factors like labor rights, despite evidence linking them to financial stability. The report cites Florida's pecuniary-only law and Montana's ESG ban as examples sowing legal confusion for fiduciaries.</p><p>State action is the antidote, AFREF argues. With pensions governed by state law, legislatures and officials can affirm their right to assess ESG risks, mirroring Biden's 2022 DOL rule, through statutes or attorney general opinions. The report highlights opportunities to reclaim pensions' shareholder voice--silenced by federal and state curbs on proxy voting--urging funds to define voting criteria on climate, equity, and labor issues. It also tackles financial deregulation risks, like weakened SEC climate disclosures, proposing state-mandated reporting akin to California's laws. In private markets, where pensions hold a third of private equity capital, states can demand transparency from advisers, drawing on derailed SEC rules for quarterly fee reports and audits.</p><p>The anti-ESG push also targets asset managers like BlackRock, managing vast pension index funds. The report notes their 22% S&amp;P 500 stake often backs short-term corporate gambles over long-term stability--exacerbated by state divestments like Florida's $2 billion BlackRock pullout. Pensions can counter this by managing funds in-house or reclaiming voting rights, while leveraging client clout to steer managers toward sustainability. States like Illinois and New Mexico exemplify DEI integration, with policies boosting diverse fund managers to enhance returns and equity.</p><p>AFREF's roadmap isn't just defense--it's a call to wield pensions' $5.3 trillion as a force for workers and communities. Facing a federal rollback of safeguards, states must act decisively, codifying ESG and DEI principles to protect retirement security and economic vitality. With $400 billion added to GDP yearly, the stakes are clear: pensions must resist being pawns in a corporate-driven agenda and instead champion a just, sustainable future.</p><p>* * # * *</p><p>Primary source of information: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roadmap-to-Protect-Public-Pensions-1.pdf\">https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roadmap-to-Protect-Public-Pensions-1.pdf</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Casa</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Millions of workers are subjected to the dangers of extreme heat that increase their risk of heat-related illnesses and fatalities. Due to personal, social, and workplace vulnerabilities, workers are at even greater risk, particularly women, people who are Black or Brown, those who facing low-income challenges, and those employed by small businesses. With no mandated federal heat stress standard, there is no federal mechanism to ensure the adoption of appropriate heat stress prevention strategies and emergency procedures to protect vulnerable workers.</p><p>Now is an opportune time to introduce a federal program to champion climate equity and justice in the workplace by assisting employers' implementation of evidence-based heat stress management strategies and heat illness emergency procedures, particularly targeting underserved working populations who labor in the heat. This program should be supported by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), along with university and nonprofit partners, and funded through a private or public partnership. This effort will act on the principles of employer social responsibility, best practice recognition, increased resource allocation to vulnerable working groups, third-party auditing, and a non-retaliation reporting mechanism. This policy action, across multiple stakeholders, will proactively address the challenges posed by extreme heat and work toward creating safer, more equitable working environments for all.</p><p>Challenge and Opportunity</p><p>The average global surface temperature in 2023 was 2.12F above the 20th century average, resulting in Earth's warmest year on record. Extreme temperatures will continue to rise as the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves increase due to climate change. Climate change is a major public health priority that places workers who perform physical labor in the heat at higher risk, due to frequent prolonged, heavy physical exertion, layers of personal protective clothing, and exposure to environmental heat stress. This combination of factors exacerbates the level of heat stress placed on the body, leading to heat-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. While the Biden Administration has initiated federal action to establish a mandated heat standard, the bureaucratic process is slow, averaging around eight years. Congress is also working on addressing this issue through the consideration of a bill for the adoption of an emergency temporary standard. Although it offers a quicker solution, it has a limited life span of approximately six months. Moreover, in anticipation of mandating a federal heat stress standard, there is limited infrastructure to support the adoption of evidence-based heat stress management strategies to protect workers in high-temperature environments. The current enforcement solution, OSHA's National Emphasis Program on outdoor and indoor heat hazards, has several limitations, include such as a vague definition of noncompliant following heat hazard inspection, and uses assessment tools such as Heat Index, which is not considered \"best practice.\"</p><p>To address these limitations, key stakeholders from academic settings, large research institutes, and nonprofit organizations have developed evidence-based best practices to protect vulnerable workers from extreme heat. Unfortunately, there is no system in place to determine how well companies are prepared for extreme heat. The urgency of adopting evidence-based heat stress management strategies across industries cannot be overstated, as heat-related injuries and fatalities are entirely preventable with the implementation of appropriate prevention strategies and emergency procedures.</p><p>There is a critical opportunity to champion climate equity and justice to safeguard laborers from the dangers of extreme heat. Laborers from vulnerable demographics who engage in physical work in the heat are disproportionately affected and are often not protected under evidence-based heat stress management practices by their employers. Workers with personal (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, disease status) and social (e.g., employment type, income status) vulnerabilities are exploited by working in hot environments with limited heat stress prevention strategies available to them. This form of labor exploitation during periods of high heat exposure leaves millions of U.S. workers more vulnerable to preventable heat-related injuries and fatalities.</p><p>Small businesses and other companies with limited resources are also less equipped to protect their workforce or have the means to ensure their employees are working in safe environments in the heat. To fortify workplace resilience against extreme heat and climate change, it is imperative to equitably distribute resources for enforcing evidence-based heat policies in workplaces. Organizations with employees exposed to high temperatures must be held accountable for the effective implementation of these policies. Additionally, vulnerable workers frequently refrain from reporting unsafe conditions due to the fear of employer retaliation. Advocacy efforts become even more challenging as language barriers, food insecurity, and poverty exacerbate already dire working conditions.</p><p>The present moment presents an opportune time to introduce a program supported by occupational health and safety federal agencies. As evidence-based best practices have been developed to protect workers from extreme heat, there is no system in place to protect vulnerable working populations, allocate resources, and keep companies accountable by assessing their current heat stress management practices. OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are key stakeholder organizations to initiate a federal response to address the lack of adoption of heat stress management policies. However, these entities often prioritize multiple projects simultaneously, are understaffed, and benefit from partnerships with universities and nonprofits. Therefore, a cooperative approach with governing like OSHA and universities/nonprofit organizations is the appropriate strategy to create a program that promotes the enforcement of evidence-based heat protection strategies (i.e., education, hydration, heat acclimatization, environmental monitoring, physiological monitoring) at the organizational level. This approach also provides under-resourced businesses with access to basic heat protection equipment and establishes a mechanism for employees to report unsafe working conditions without fear of retaliation. This program draws inspiration from the success of the Fair Food Program, a Corporate Social Responsibility model that promotes accountability among growers, buyers, and retailers.</p><p>This comprehensive program will support all organizations that employ workers who perform physical work in the heat, such as construction, utilities, agriculture, oil, and gas. This program will facilitate employer accountability, social responsibility, increased resource allocation, third-party auditing, and a non-retaliation reporting system.</p><p>Plan of Action</p><p>The development and implementation of this federal program, the Occupational Heat Resiliency Program (OHRP), will require a public-private partnership between OSHA, universities, and nonprofit partners. This partnership model draws inspiration from the successful collaborative partnerships between OSHA and other partners to protect the workforce against other occupational hazards. The OHRP will promote the adoption of evidence-based heat stress management practices by targeting employers with workplaces that experience high heat exposure and/or have a large population of laborers working in the heat who are classified as vulnerable workers. The establishment of OHRP will require funding through cooperative agreements, such as the OSHA Strategic Partnership Program (OSPP). To achieve the program's objectives, both OSHA and its partners will commit their knowledge and resources to support the program.</p><p>The program will rely on the following principles to achieve this objective:</p><p>Employer accountability and best practice recognition:</p><p>Employers engaging with the proposed federal program will formalize their commitment to safeguarding workers from extreme heat through evidence-based practices derived from original research from research institutes and academic organizations. These original research sources have informed governing body recommendations from institutes such as NIOSH.</p><p>These commitments can be publicized, creating transparency and ensuring that products are manufactured by adequately protected workers.</p><p>The program aims to promote the adoption of evidence-based heat practices that enhance safety, health, and productivity for the U.S. workforce.</p><p>Recognition of best practices will facilitate widespread adoption, empowering employers, safety professionals, and workers to implement strategies and emergency procedures that effectively mitigate the risk of heat-related illnesses and injuries.</p><p>Climate equity through increased resource allocation:</p><p>Recognizing the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, the program will allocate resources to workplaces with high percentages (&gt;50%) of at-risk workers. This includes small businesses and workplaces with a high percentage of women, people of Color, and low-income workers. Workplace needs will be performed through existing efforts related to other occupational hazards or community projects and by targeting industries associated with increased employment of vulnerable workers.</p><p>Support may include assistance in creating heat stress management educational materials and emergency action plans/procedures, implementing written heat stress management plans, and providing essential resources such as hydration, shade, and cooling products.</p><p>Safer work environments through third-party auditing and a non-retaliation reporting system:</p><p>Third-party audits, led by university or non-profit partners, will determine feasible evidence-based practices and resource allocations.</p><p>Audits will employ a tier system (I, II, II) to show the level of protection that the workplace has implemented based on the presented recommendations. To ensure compliance, a non-retaliation reporting system will allow workers to report incidences where their work environment was unsafe due to extreme heat.</p><p>A non-retaliation reporting system will be implemented to empower workers to report unsafe conditions due to extreme heat, ensuring employer compliance and accountability. This information within the report will not be shared with employers directly, but rather through the third-party auditing entity.</p><p>The program will be led by teams composed of OSHA representatives and university/nonprofit partners that will meet virtually regularly to ensure the goals of each principle are being met and to address any partnership issues that may arise.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The escalating challenges to the U.S. workforce posed by extreme heat demand proactive measures, necessitating collaboration among key government entities like OSHA alongside universities and nonprofit organizations. Currently, there is a glaring absence of mechanisms to safeguard workers who engage in physical work in the heat, particularly those from vulnerable demographics.</p><p>To tackle this issue head-on, the establishment of OHRP funded through a private or public partnership is imperative. This initiative would champion climate equity in the workplace by expediting the adoption of evidence-based heat stress management strategies and emergency procedures. The program's framework includes commitments from employers, recognition of best practices, increased resource allocation to vulnerable working groups, third-party auditing, and a non-retaliation mechanism. OHRP will have an immediate impact at both the federal and state level. Without the implementation of such a program, a significant portion of the U.S. workforce remains at risk of entirely preventable heat-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126472736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BPD-8G21-JCBF-S00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 1, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The involved parties agreed in a Wednesday court filing to a hearing in early April to discuss the plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunctions and to file those motions by Friday.</p><p>\"Today's decision is a strong step in the right direction,\" Climate United CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement. \"In the coming weeks, we will continue working towards a long-term solution that will allow us to invest in projects that deliver energy savings, create jobs, and boost American manufacturing in communities across the country.\"</p><p>Climate United alleges thatCiti'sactions are in violation of account control agreements between the organization and the bank.</p><p>Citi, which had been designated as the bank to hold the grant recipients' funds, froze the accounts associated with the funding in February to comply with a request by the FBI. Later, the EPA and the Department of Treasury ordered the bank to stop disbursing payments.</p><p>The bank said in its opposition to the plaintiffs' motion last week that it was upholding contractual obligations to the government, including fiduciary duty of loyalty, which it said superseded agreements between the bank and grant recipients.</p><p>Citisaid the FBI had requested last month that the bank freeze the accounts of the climate groups, which also included Habitat for Humanity, New Jersey Green Bank and United Way Worldwide. In its letter toCiti, the bureau cited \"credible information\" regarding \"possible criminal violations,\" such as conspiracy to defraud the United States and wire fraud.</p><p>Citideclined to comment Wednesday on the judge's decision.</p><p>The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which Congress approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, was designed to dole out $20 billion to nonprofits. The money was meant to finance climate-focused initiatives in under-resourced sectors and areas, like solar panel installations in low-income communities.</p><p>Chutkan wrote in her Tuesday decision that the EPA hasn't provided \"credible evidence\" to support terminating the grants.</p><p>\"At the very least, there are serious due process concerns and questions of whether EPA Defendants' actions were 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law,'\" she said in the opinion.</p><p>Zeldin, a long-time Trump ally now leading the EPA, said last week that he was shutting down the program, in line with the administration's initiatives to cut government programs across agencies.</p><p>The EPA said that under President Joe Biden, the agency had \"parked tens of billions of taxpayer dollars at an outside financial institution in a manner that deliberately reduced the ability of EPA to conduct proper oversight.\" Zeldin added in prepared remarks that the program was being shut down due to \"misconduct, conflicts of interest and potential fraud.\"</p><p>\"I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending,\" Zeldin said. \"EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars dedicated to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of 'climate equity.'\"</p><p>Lena Moffitt, executive director at climate-focused trade group Evergreen Action, said in a statement that the judge's latest decision was an \"important initial victory.\" She added that businesses and communities where the grants had been allocated are counting on the money being released.</p><p>\"Today, a federal judge stated what has been clear from the beginning: Zeldin's EPA has failed to provide any real evidence to back up its conspiratorial accusations,\" Moffitt said. \"Congress passed a law mandating the distribution of these investments to deliver cost savings and expand access to cheaper, cleaner energy, and that's exactly where they were going before Lee Zeldin got involved.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The City is seeking applicants with a diversity of backgrounds and experiences, representing the demographics of our communities to strengthen the work of our teams. Many boards, commissions and advisory committees play roles in the Citys decision-making process. They advise and make recommendations on public policy that affects City services and programs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Being on a committee with the city is such a great way to really impact the world around you and not just experience it, but actually be part of it and learn more about it, about projects and actually play a role in making the city better, said Aaron Shaffer, member of the Bicycle Advisory Committee. Sometimes it's as easy as just asking project staff at a meeting if they can look into X or Y to make the project a little better.</p><p>It makes our city better, it eases understanding and it improves outcomes, said Max Singer, member of the Bicycle Advisory Committee. It really is a phenomenal opportunity to work together and be a resource for your city and your community and the causes or issues that you hold dear.</p><p>We serve as kind of a nice bridge between what's happening out on the streets and what's happening in City Hall, said Leisa Meeuwen-Ristuben, a member of the Pedestrian Advisory Committee Even if you're brand new to the committee, there's always somebody that's willing to talk you through things. You don't even need to know the technical terms in order to say, hey, I want to make sure I can walk from place to place.</p><p>More than 500 volunteers currently serve on the Citys more than 40 boards and commissions. Many describe the experience of serving as strengthening their personal growth, their connection with community and contributing to their professional development.</p><p>It has been an incredibly rewarding experience, both the personal development that I've experienced from my learning of the city and processes but also as an opportunity to serve my community better, said Singer. Working together with the committee, you build that expertise to both help the city in their projects and help you in being engaged in your community.</p><p>Boards and Commissions members have brought forward recommendations that have resulted in new protections and investments in the community. A few examples include renter and wage protections, bicycle safety infrastructure, the Climate Equity Plan and ongoing work to update the Minneapolis Civil Rights Ordinance. Whether youre young or old, a recent transplant or lifelong resident, a small business owner or CEO, all are welcome to volunteer to make Minneapolis an even better place to call home.</p><p>It really is a rewarding feeling to know that a project came to you from the beginning, from 0% design, just a concept and then you were able to give your input and then you see it 2, 3, 4, years later complete and are actually able to ride your bike on something and see a little design element that you suggested staff look at, Shaffer</p><p>said.</p><p>\"Learning about and becoming part of the Food Council has been the highlight of my year! said Cory Wintersteen, member of the Homegrown Minneapolis Food Council. I was so happy to find a group of fun, like minded people to talk food, gardening, and community engagement with! I look forward to it every month and by the end of the meeting I always leave feeling jazzed up and excited for the next one!\"</p><p>Applications for boards and commissions will be accepted March 1st through March 31st. Applications to serve on the Community Commission on Police Oversight are still open and will close on March 16th.</p><p>Translation and interpreting are available so all residents can participate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126996266</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F7H-6D03-S328-H43P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 28, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Bicycles</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzI1NzcxRjQ3QTQxNEVBOTg5RDFFRkYyRTM3QzdENkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUI2RkNERjc3QTRCNEEyRkI5QkQwRTRFMzFBQkUxMjA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DL5W</classCode><className>BICYCLE SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001948</classCode><className>LABOR &amp; EMPLOYMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DKUD</classCode><className>BICYCLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000601</classCode><className>EMPLOYEE TRAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000440</classCode><className>CYCLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000302</classCode><className>CIVIL RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DL5W</classCode><className>BICYCLE SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DKUD</classCode><className>BICYCLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GX614</classCode><className>MINNEAPOLIS, MN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

San Diego City Councilwoman Vivian Moreno was the only other candidate with at least 10% of the vote, placing third with 13%.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An updated vote count is expected to be released Thursday evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If a candidate receives a majority of the vote, he or she would win outright, avoiding a runoff election.</p><p>Aguirre issued a statement Tuesday night celebrating the results, in which she said they sent \"a clear message -- voters want a supervisor who fights on the side of working people who are struggling, gets results on the sewage crisis, and pushes for the more affordable San Diego County we need.\"</p><p>Along with thanking voters and her fellow candidates, Aguirre made note of McCann, her apparent opponent in the July 1 runoff.</p><p>\"Now, the stakes couldn't be higher. This runoff is a clear choice between Democratic values that put working people first, and a Trump Republican agenda that would be a complete disaster for all of San Diego County. We deserve leaders who fight for economic security for everyone, no matter how much money you make or what neighborhood you live in.\"</p><p>McCann released a statement on Tuesday evening that read, \"I am thankful for the hundreds of volunteers who have worked on my campaign and the thousands of voters that cast their vote for me. They know I will bring common sense back to San Diego County by supporting law enforcement to keep our streets safe, getting homeless off the streets, working to get real solutions on the Tijuana sewage issue and opposing the mileage tax.\"</p><p>Seven people, including four elected officials, entered the race to replace former San Diego County Supervisor Nora Vargas after she suddenly announced in late December that she would not serve her second term despite winning reelection in November.</p><p>Along with McCann, Aguirre, and Moreno, the candidates are Chula Vista Deputy Mayor Carolina Chavez; energy consultant Elizabeth Efird; business owner and former Imperial County Supervisor Louis Fuentes; and marketing firm associate Lincoln Pickard.</p><p>McCann, a Navy veteran and Chula Vista native first elected as that city's mayor in 2022, said on his website that Chula Vista's wildfire response has \"demonstrated his ability to protect residents in times of crisis.\"</p><p>McCann's platform includes increased funding for law enforcement, and \"fighting to lower the cost of living by cutting government waste, opposing unnecessary tax hikes, and blocking burdensome policies like the mileage tax and (San Diego Association of Governments) tax.\"</p><p>McCann said that if elected, he will \"fight to expand health care access, job training programs, and essential services for veterans, ensuring they receive the support they have earned.\"</p><p>In response to the border sewage problem, McCann said he has \"been actively working with local, state and federal officials to secure funding for infrastructure improvements, hold responsible parties accountable and push for long-term solutions to stop the flow of toxic waste into our waters.\"</p><p>Aguirre told City News Service she is \"running to bring change to county government, to fight on the side of working people and start getting results we all need -- fixing the sewage crisis, lowering energy rates and fighting crime in every community.\"</p><p>Born in San Francisco, Aguirre has called Southern California home since 2001 and has been Imperial Beach's mayor since December 2022. She has been outspoken on the U.S.-Mexico border sewage pollution problem, which has closed beaches and caused serious health issues for some residents.</p><p>Aguirre said she'll \"get the county off the sidelines\" by funding infrastructure, demanding Superfund designation from the Environmental Protection Agency and \"treating this as the public health emergency it is.\"</p><p>Aguirre said that if elected, she'll push \"for a full audit of county homelessness spending, prioritize real treatment and shelter options, and stop the cycle of failed programs that leave people languishing on the streets.\"</p><p>On her campaign website, Moreno -- a San Diego native and City Council member since 2018 -- states that she \"has dedicated her career to improving the region's most underserved communities through experience, volunteer work and public service.\"</p><p>\"Our county government is broken, so I'm running to fix it ... Together, we can build a county government that works for us. Together, we can continue to build a better South Bay,\" Moreno said in a campaign video. \"Failed leadership has left our region unaffordable, unsafe and polluted, where essential services remain inaccessible to families who work hard and strive for a better life.\"</p><p>Her campaign website touts her City Council accomplishments, including paving dirt roads, establishing the Climate Equity Fund, using existing city and council facilities for shelters, opening Benson Place, an 82-unit supportive housing complex, and distributing emergency rental assistance to 18,000 families during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Chavez, who describes herself as a \"lifelong resident of the Cali-Baja region,\" has served on the Chula Vista City Council since December 2022. She said she will \"champion job creation, support small businesses and expand workforce development,\" according to her campaign website.</p><p>Chavez added that if elected, she will \"ensure that law enforcement has the resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe while fostering partnerships that prioritize safety and trust.\"</p><p>The candidate said officials need to address homelessness \"with both compassion and urgency,\" by expanding access to mental health care, substance abuse treatment, emergency shelter and wraparound services \"while working with our cities and nonprofit organizations to create housing options and job opportunities.\"</p><p>Chavez's platform also focuses on \"the urgent public health crisis of transboundary pollution in the Tijuana River Valley by advocating for targeted funding and sustainable solutions that directly protect our environment and public health.\"</p><p>Fuentes, president of Air Conditioning Guys, grew up in Calexico and has lived in Chula Vista since 2014. He previously served as a Calexico City Council member and mayor, and on the Imperial County Board of Supervisors.</p><p>Fuentes states on his campaign website that he will fight to ensure that South Bay border communities get funding they deserve for public safety, road repairs, small business development and affordable housing.</p><p>Fuentes told City News Service that his top issues are economic growth, community health, public safety and education and arts. Stable employment and youth job opportunities create \"a better quality of life,\" Fuentes said.</p><p>When dealing with homelessness, Fuentes said he would focus on \"helping organizations that are doing good work, so they can demonstrate some success stories.\"</p><p>Regarding the trans-border pollution problem, Fuentes said \"there can be a diplomatic solution\" to the issue, rather than having it become a political or legal battle.</p><p>Efird told KPBS she \"supports implementing stronger protections for renters and focusing more funding on public health measures to support neighborhoods affected by the crossborder sewage crisis,\" and supports the county's stronger sanctuary policies for immigrants in the country without legal permission.</p><p>A longtime county resident, Pickard is an associate at Mannatech, a dietary supplements and personal care company. He has run for the Assembly five times since 2016 and for a San Diego City Council seat in 2014.</p><p>Pickard's campaign platform includes stopping the mileage tax, eliminating the toll on state Route 125, supporting offshore drilling to lower gasoline prices and requiring voter identification.</p><p>\"While we love legal immigration, we need to control who enters our country the same way we screen people entering our private clubs, our homes and our companies,\" Pickard's website states.</p><p>\"We need to stop the drugs that are killing and destroying so many of our young people.\"</p><p>Pickard also advocates for the Trump administration to assist in resolving the border sewage problem, ending the Federal Reserve, lowering taxes and reasonable regulations \"which will increase profits for businesses and help create more jobs for our people.\"</p><p>With a population of 650,000, District 1 contains three cities, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and National City, along with 15 neighborhoods in San Diego, including East Village, Mountain View and San Ysidro, and six unincorporated communities, including Bonita, East Otay Mesa and portion of Spring Valley.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-SDSUPERVISORELEXMCCANNAGUIRREAPPEARHEADEDFORJULY1RUNOFFFORDISTRICT1SUPERVISORSEAT</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHS-DM43-S5N8-S471-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1482\"/><timeReceived>11:28 PM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 City News Service, Inc.

The two documents, called notices of funding opportunity, were taken down Thursday as the administration moves to end government climate programs and diversity efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency published them shortly before President Donald Trump took office to explain its goals and priorities for two of the nation's main disaster grant programs. The Biden administration and Congress had vastly increased funding in recent years for both programs, which pay for mitigation projects to harden infrastructure or structures against future disasters. </p><p>President Joe Biden heralded the increased funding as part of his effort to address climate change. One of the removed documents, which was obtained by POLITICO's E&amp;E News, warned about \"the growing hazards associated with climate change\" and urged \"mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation.\" The notice also prioritized using federal funding to promote \"the goal of equity\" by helping environmental justice communities - areas with vulnerable populations and high exposure to climate impacts. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said removing funding notices while state and local governments were developing applications \"is another irresponsible action of this administration.\" By publishing the notices on Jan. 6, FEMA enabled state and local governments to begin applying for the grants before the April 18 deadline. \"I am concerned that the administration will continue its unlawful actions on grants and is planning to hold $1.35 billion in mitigation grants political hostage,\" Thompson said in a statement to E&amp;E News. FEMA did not respond to requests for comment. One former senior FEMA official said it appears that the Trump administration intends to fund both programs because they are still listed on the federal grants website but without the funding notices. The notices also were pulled from FEMA's website. \"They're scratching some language having to do with climate, equity and innovation,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution. FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program was to provide $750 million in grants this year for a range of projects such as elevating flood-prone homes and building wind shelters. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program was to provide $600 million in grants this year for local flood protection. \"My hope is that it's just streamlining the language to eliminate the language that this administration doesn't like. Hopefully it'll lead to enough flexibility where states that want to help their most high-risk communities can do that,\" the former FEMA official said. The two programs have given states roughly $8 billion since 2016, an E&amp;E News analysis shows. Created through legislation Trump signed in 2018, the BRIC program under the Biden administration emphasized addressing climate change and helping environmental justice communities. The documents were removed on the same day that FEMA's acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, posted a video on X announcing a full review of all FEMA grants and funding to nongovernmental organizations. \"Our goal is to prioritize survivors and communities impacted by the hardest hit disasters. We are doing this because we want to be responsible with our dollars and deliver them to those in need,\" Hamilton said in the 38-second video. Four FEMA officials including its chief financial officer were fired last week for processing a previously approved $59 million payment to reimburse New York City for sheltering undocumented migrants.

We test whether a lockbox intervention paired with micro-saving nudges could alleviate the unaffordability of clean fuels. In a year-long stepped-wedge randomized control trial in Tanzania (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 511), we find that compared to savings nudges only, a lockbox and savings nudges increased annual refills of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by 1.4 (0.054 per 2 weeks ([95% confidence interval: 0.043, 0.066], <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001)) and minimally decreased firewood use but had no effect on lags between LPG refills or the frequency of LPG and charcoal use. We find that easing liquidity constraints is insufficient for exclusive LPG use when LPG is the financial responsibility of only women, who ration LPG purchases to meet other household needs and social expectations. The financial and gendered realities of low-income consumers demand clean energy policies beyond easing liquidity constraints or targeted subsidies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clean cooking fuels can be unaffordable. A year-long randomized control trial in Tanzania finds that a lockbox intervention along with behavioural nudging to encourage savings modestly increased liquefied petroleum gas use but did not lead to exclusive adoption, and that gendered financial constraints explain these results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis>About 2.4 billion people rely on smoky solid fuels, resulting in ambient and household air pollution (HAP), to which over eight million annual untimely deaths are attributed1. Near-exclusive use of \u2018clean\u2019 stoves and fuels, as categorized by the World Health Organization, is needed to avert negative health outcomes2. Affordability remains one of the largest barriers to the consistent use of clean cookstoves and fuels3,4. The challenge for energy policy is thus to provide affordable clean stoves and fuels that minimize users reverting to biomass (the \u2018refill gap\u2019)5 or using multiple stoves in parallel (stove \u2018stacking\u2019)6.</p><p>Clean cooking has two cost components: the upfront stove cost and the ongoing fuel and maintenance costs4,6, 7, 8, 9\u201310. The fuel cost consists of everyday sums or occasional lump sums. Traditional fuels (wood, agricultural waste) are often purchased or collected day to day, whereas cleaner fuels such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) are purchased on a monthly (or longer) basis. Many individuals without clean fuels have neither regular cash flows nor financial tools11,12, making it difficult to save even modest sums. Further, individuals under the stress of chronic poverty often \u2018tunnel\u2019 or focus exclusively on immediate priorities, struggle to make forward-looking choices and must exert constant vigilance to not spend the small amounts that they could (and often must) save13,14.</p><p>The clean cooking literature has focused more on the upfront cost of clean stoves15, 16\u201317 than on financing the recurring fuel costs or reducing the refill gap. Micro-saving programmes could potentially accommodate low-income users\u2019 spending and saving patterns for either upfront or recurring costs. Numerous randomized control trials (RCTs) have investigated banked savings programmes18, 19\u201320, organized savings groups21, 22\u201323 and portable devices such as lockboxes23, 24\u201325, with varying levels of commitment. Lockboxes have been proven to help increase savings overall26 as well specifically for healthcare23 and education24,25. We hypothesized that tools to encourage small savings could help to increase (on time) clean fuel refills.</p><p>The behavioural economics literature has developed a range of interventions to encourage socially desirable habits, including nudges, boosts, gamification, priming, framing and so on27,28. Nudge theory29 is based on structuring choices to guide individuals towards better decisions without restricting their freedom or requiring notable changes to existing practices. Savings nudges in the literature make strategic use of such small interventions30,31 to protect against procrastination or valuing current consumption over future needs. Another suggested solution to the savings challenge is setting up dedicated saving accounts (earmarked for specific purchases) for low-income individuals. These accounts do not alleviate scarcity itself but could remind participants of their savings goals32, lower the mental burden of remembering to save and give individuals a sense of control even under constrained circumstances.</p><p>Combining these literatures, we designed an intervention that incorporates a dedicated account (drawing on behavioural economics) as a financial tool for small savings (drawing on clean cooking research) and acknowledges that nudging or encouragement (also from behavioural economics) may be necessary to facilitate a pro-saving behaviour change. We provided individuals a locked deposit box (\u2018lockbox\u2019), earmarked for LPG cylinders, which served as an informal financial device and a physical reminder to save, but without formal commitment or enforcement. Our theory of change was that if individuals saved in the lockbox, this would increase their on-hand liquidity (having eased their liquidity constraints) to spend on LPG refills. We present here the results on changes on LPG purchases on account of any change in savings. We also present new ethnographic evidence to explain our experimental results, grounded in understanding intra-household gender dynamics and the portfolio of household needs as key determinants of purchasing and using clean fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experimental design</emphasis></p><p>We designed a year-long stepped-wedge RCT in which participants (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 511) across Shirati, a rural town in Mara Region, Tanzania, started in control and then crossed over in waves into the intervention/treatment group. At the baseline, no one used LPG. Each participant received two free 6-kg LPG cylinder/burner sets, along with information from their community technology worker (CTW). All future refills of the LPG cylinder were the participant\u2019s responsibility (~US$10). Participants were randomly assigned to roll over into the treatment (that is, receiving the lockbox) (Fig. 1). The CTWs followed up every 2 weeks to encourage clean fuel use and nudge participants to save, for both treatment and control. That is, the control group also received encouragement nudges. At these visits, the CTWs also conducted surveys. From those surveys, LPG purchase receipts and triangulation with photos, we constructed our pre-specified primary outcomes: purchased refills, the days between running out of LPG and purchasing the next cylinder (\u2018the refill gap\u2019), categories of LPG use (exclusive, habitual, occasional and none) and biomass (firewood/charcoal) usage33. Savings outcomes are reported in another paper (A.G.-W., manuscript in preparation). Following the full trial, we conducted a 6-month period of qualitative work that included observations, focus groups, budgetary games and 90 semi-structured interviews (Methods).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Schematic of study design.</emphasis></p><p>This illustration depicts how individuals transitioned into the treatment of a locked deposit box. We enrolled 511 participants at baseline (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0) and then randomly assigned each to transition into treatment after weeks 16 through 32. The first ~46 participants received the intervention (blue) at week 18, then ~46 more participants at week 20 and so forth until all 511 respondents received the treatment. Once in treatment, participants remained thus until the end of the study. The randomized rollout was intended to create balanced comparison groups between the control (white) and the treatment (blue). Photo of lockbox and key taken by A.G.-W. Lockboxes were hand crafted by a local artist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sample characteristics</emphasis></p><p>We spoke with the mostly female main cooks (94%) with an average weekly expenditure of US$56.7 (standard deviation (s.d.) 34.4) after adjusting for purchasing power parity (PPP) (Table 1). Women earned small amounts of income from selling products from their farms, selling small fish, braiding hair and so on. LPG use in the region was very low ( ~ 2% in 2018)34. Confirming previous anthropological literature from sub-Saharan Africa35, 36\u201337, spouses kept finances completely separate: \u201cThere are very few couples who save their money together\u201d (Respondent 4, Focus Group 1). Women were responsible for daily household expenses (for example, food, soap, charcoal and children\u2019s needs), while men were responsible for larger purchases (building the house, furniture, television and so on). Couples could come together for certain purchases, but this was not the norm. Spouses rarely disclosed their financial status to each other. Thus, our main respondents reported only their own available weekly expenditures. At the baseline, 56% of respondents reported being able to save anything at all.Table 1</p><p>Socio-demographic characteristics of our sampled respondents, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 511</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Female respondent (main cook), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">480 (94%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Female-headed households, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">145 (29%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Age, mean [range]</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">41 [18,88]</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Luo tribe, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">446 (88%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of individuals living together, mean [range]</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6 [1,20]</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Children &lt;12, mean [range]</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2 [0,15]</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of individuals eating together, mean [range]</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6 [1,16]</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Occupation of main cook</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Farmer, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">411 (81%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Business, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">51 (10%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Nurse, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5 (1%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Cares for the home, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24 (5%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Other occupation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15 (3%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Education of main cook</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?No formal education, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">18 (4%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Primary school, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">450 (88%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Secondary school, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">39 (8%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?University, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1 (0%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Expenditure and saving</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Respondent?s weekly expenditure, mean (s.d.)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US$17.2 (10.4)a</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Respondent?s weekly expenditure PPP, mean (s.d.)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US$56.7 (34.4)b</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Ability to save at all, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">286 (56%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Female saves alone, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> (%), endlinec</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">433 (89%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Attrition</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Maximum missingness within a single visit</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>aAn average exchange rate of US$1 = 2,325.96 Tanzanian shillings was used in January 2022.</p><p>bWe use a PPP of 3.30 for 2022.</p><p>cThis value was from the final visit where 489 respondents were contacted that week, and 18 did not answer this question as they were struggling to save.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Treatment effects on clean fuel and biomass usage</emphasis></p><p>We assess treatment impact on refills by constructing a user\u2019s rate of refilling while in control versus treatment (total refills in control or treatment divided by cumulative time in control or treatment). For all other outcomes, we analyse immediate and cumulative impacts of offering participants a lockbox. The immediate impact of treatment is the outcome for the following 2-week time period, whereas the cumulative impact of treatment is the average impact of each additional time period in treatment. For all outcomes, we report the average treatment effect (ATE), that is, the difference in the mean outcomes between treatment and control groups (Methods) and conduct subgroup analysis for first (low), second and third (mid) and fourth quartile (high) expenditure strata (Supplementary Fig. 4).</p><p>Regarding savings, we find that uptake of the lockbox was very high ( ~ 96% by the final visit) and that treatment immediately caused an additional 13% (95% confidence interval (CI): (10.7%, 15.4%, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) of participants to save within the next 2 weeks, compared to control (A.G.-W., manuscript in preparation).

They were stacking with other fuels and seemed to time running out of LPG for when they had money to refill (Supplementary Fig. 1). Respondents\u2019 rationing behaviour avoided any measured LPG \u2018refill gap\u2019. During follow-up interviews, some women acknowledged rationing LPG use to avoid absolutely running out: \u201cI decided to reduce my gas use so that it should take at least one month to run out\u2026 if I decide to use it only, it will not even take one month [to run out] \u2026so I decide to use it to make only tea and reheat the food\u201d (Respondent 2, Focus Group 1). Many individuals reported stacking, reducing their LPG use to occasional (such as reheating food) to control when they would run out; others simply never refilled (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Categories of LPG use during study.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>, We tracked categories of LPG use across low (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), mid (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) and high (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) per capita expenditure strata during treatment (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) and control (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) periods. Most respondents were using a combination of LPG and firewood and/or charcoal (that is, stacking stoves). We stop the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> axis at 26 weeks in treatment or control to keep observations around 50 individuals for each time point.</p><p>Most respondents claimed to need only one cylinder, holding the second as reserve for when the first cylinder ran out: \u201cWhile using one cylinder I save for another one\u201d (Respondent 387). This was also a form of rationing: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s hard to get money to refill them both at once\u201d (Respondent 178). Using only one cylinder was also a way to maintain savings for other items: \u201cI was just saving and not only for gas\u2026I have not refilled the second one because for now we have a lot of funerals\u201d (Respondent 54). Money for refills was especially tight as LPG purchases were solely in the women\u2019s expenditure domain; their \u2018share\u2019 of the household expenses was being saved towards LPG (and food-related expenses overall). Men rarely assisted with LPG refills: \u201cIn all cooking matters women are the one responsible\u2026 as a woman you will struggle to make sure you refill the cylinder and cook, so when he comes home, he only eats\u201d (Respondent 4).</p><p>Regarding self-reported LPG use categories, we find, while controlling for weeks into the experiment, neither an immediate nor cumulative impact. Descriptively, the percentage of participants reporting no LPG use rose with number of weeks in control across all income strata. The percentage reporting no LPG use was, on average, higher in treatment than in control but did not increase measurably with weeks in treatment (Table 2, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). The stability of LPG use categories reinforces our result that users were rationing their LPG.</p><p>Each additional 2-week period in treatment decreased average firewood use by \u22120.038 kg (95% CI: (\u22120.078, 0.002) (extrapolates to ~1 kg a day by the end of the year), particularly for participants with mid-level expenditure (Supplementary Table 3). Stacking was stable throughout control and treatment, consistent with our treatment effects, which found minimal effect on biomass usage (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While stacking fuels, respondents across expenditure strata were spending well over the 5% threshold (using only the women\u2019s reported expenditures as denominators) set by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) as the affordability bar for cooking fuel38. Low expenditure participants spent the largest percentage (Supplementary Fig. 3). The post-treatment fuel expenditure ratio is largely consistent with that reported at baseline; polluting fuels thus account for substantial costs, often similar to clean fuels per unit of energy generated (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our interviews and focus groups explained these results through two recurring themes: LPG was but one priority among many, and the nature of cooking fuel purchases is highly gendered.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Easing liquidity is insufficient given a portfolio of needs</emphasis></p><p>The treatment was an effective nudge for respondents to save, thus easing their liquidity constraints (A.G.-W., manuscript in preparation). They dipped into those savings for refills, essential items as well as emergencies: \u201cI am the one buying each and everything in this house [so] the money that I was supposed to buy gas with I use to buy food\u201d (Respondent 67). Or \u201cthe child was sick, so we used the [lockbox] money\u201d (Respondent 400). Most women we interviewed claimed to be saving for LPG but ultimately saved whatever they could, whenever they could (Fig. 4).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualitative results.</emphasis></p><p>Our qualitative results reveal that the unaffordability of LPG (white) is underpinned by (1) a portfolio of (competing and urgent) needs that prevent easing liquidity constraints from fully addressing the financial challenge (orange) and (2) the gendered expectations of household budgets that place LPG in the woman\u2019s domain (brown). TSH, Tanzanian shillings.</p><p>The lockbox increased participants\u02bc recognition of the need to save for LPG: \u201cit is good to save because it\u2019s hard to get all 24,000 shillings at once\u201d (Respondent 202). And they did in fact save. This awareness could have contributed to the stabilizing LPG use and continued rationing: \u201cI can even see how much I am left with to reach the total amount\u201d (Respondent 273). The lockbox visualized for participants the fraction of the hefty LPG refill cost that they had on hand: \u201cif I use gas daily it will run out quickly before I get enough money to refill\u201d (Respondent 13). Participants used the lockbox to time when the cylinder would run out to when they had enough saved (Fig. 4).</p><p>When the gas ran out, they would look in the lockbox to see if there was enough to refill. If there was enough, or almost enough, they tended to refill. If there was any extra, they would buy other things, they would not leave the residual towards a future refill. If there was not enough, they waited to refill, turning to the second cylinder and reducing their LPG use: \u201cin the lockbox we were just saving so that when the cylinder runs out, we go and refill and if there is some amount of money left after refilling, we just use the money to buy other items in the house\u201d (Respondent 500). Having enough money on hand in their lockboxes (that is, easing liquidity constraints) was a necessary but by no means sufficient condition to increase LPG use given the portfolio of needs.</p><p>The literature suggests many reasons for continued stove stacking8,39, but the slight reduction in firewood and no change in charcoal that we find is largely underpinned by low and fluctuating incomes. The instability of their financial situations made saving particularly hard: \u201cI am now saving if I get money, it\u2019s not every week\u2026 because I depend on the business of oranges and as you know it\u2019s seasonal\u201d (Respondent 272). Distance to refill, often cited as a separate barrier, contributed to the affordability challenge in that transport typically added another dollar to the refill cost). The widespread prevalence of rationing (using LPG when in a hurry, reducing LPG to never run out, refusing to use LPG for beans because beans have a long cooking time and so on) points to unaffordability being a dominant reason for persistent stacking. For instance: \u201cI don\u2019t want to run out\u201d [when cooking beans] (Respondent 101). To our probe: \u201cSo is it something about the beans?,\u201d the response was: \u201cNo, it\u2019s about the money\u201d. Participants expressed a strong preference for LPG: \u201cif gas was free, I\u2019d refill everyday\u2026even if there was still available firewood and charcoal\u201d (Respondent 13).</p><p>The literature already documents the unaffordability of clean cooking fuels40, 41\u201342. Our results support that literature but show that alleviating liquidity constraints alone is insufficient to mitigate unaffordability, in contrast to previously posed hypotheses4. We show that even when there are savings increases, LPG is not always prioritized amid myriad household needs. With saved money, many items become more affordable, not LPG alone. There have not been any randomized trials of pay-as-you-go LPG43, but our results suggest similar competing needs would arise. We also find that fluctuating business opportunities make for fluctuating savings: \u201c[my savings] depends on how much I sell, because sometimes I sell 500 or 1000 or 3000 TSH\u201d (Respondent 179). Small irregular cash flows make it easier to purchase fuel in small irregular quantities. In reality, even if LPG is not substantially more expensive than charcoal per unit of energy, it is more \u2018unaffordable\u02bc because it is a lumpy purchase. We conclude that LPG is unaffordable not as a stand-alone commodity but in the context of other unmet needs and uncertain income streams.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The gendered nature of clean fuel purchases</emphasis></p><p>We initially targeted main cooks as representing their households. However, we found that not just the physical but the financial burden of cooking falls on the woman. A survey enumerator explained: \u201cWomen have always been the ones to collect firewood or purchase charcoal, so even though it is now purchasing gas, it is still her responsibility\u201d. Using their own earnings, a stipend from their husbands or both, women alone were responsible for cooking fuel purchases. We highlight here the under-appreciated separation of financial responsibility for fuels rather than the intra-household power asymmetry highlighted in other work44,45. In this part of Africa, LPG is not a \u2018household\u02bc expense, so the total income in \u2018a household\u02bc is not necessarily a predictor of LPG\u2019s affordability.</p><p>Our results suggest that successful efforts to increase clean fuel use demand a gendered understanding of household responsibilities. We need to understand what women are asked to give up to purchase clean fuels consistently. Where household finances are entirely in women\u2019s hands, they are the ones who must choose between LPG and clothes for their children. Some researchers have implied that non-habitual use of clean fuels or continued stacking means that the users do not truly value the benefits of clean stoves9,46,47, but we find that women do value and purchase LPG with higher savings. While they do not refill LPG at the frequencies needed to see health benefits (exclusive use)2, we argue that this reflects long-standing practices of women paying for household needs with their own health when they cannot pay with cash. Feminist scholarship, echoing the work of Sen48, has argued that an individual\u2019s overt preferences do not reflect individual welfare where the preferences themselves have had to adapt to constrained circumstances49. We, therefore, cannot conflate LPG non-use with low valuations for clean energy; rather, we must re-conceptualize this choice as reflecting low valuations of women\u2019s health. This re-conceptualization strongly supports the need for the energy and health sectors to account for the full costs of their interventions and for the individual who is expected to pay these costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion and conclusions</emphasis></p><p>Our study demonstrates that an effective \u2018nudge\u2018 to (modestly) increase LPG consumption and keep individuals from running out completely of LPG is possible at the level of individual cooks. Although we only find an increase in ~1.4 refills (8.4 kgs) over the year and no change in LPG use categories, prominent LPG policies have been even less successful. India\u2019s policies for individuals below-the-poverty line (for example, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana), which covered the upfront cost of the stove, led to an annual refill increase of 0.68 kg of LPG50. Experimental evidence indicates that LPG demand is very sensitive to price51, even with pay-as-you-go models52. Our intervention increased LPG consumption, but not exclusive use, the level needed for potential health benefits2. Even with eased liquidity constraints, therefore, and intention to save for clean cooking fuels, financial and gendered realities forced our participants to continue to stack LPG and solid-fuel stoves. Our findings have research and policy implications well beyond rural Tanzania, as intra-household budgeting separation and multiple household needs are common in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Our results are a call to reconsider a key metric used to measure clean fuel affordability: the conventional affordability ratio40. The conventional affordability ratio is typically constructed as the ratio of fuel costs to the household monthly expenditure40. However, we have shown that fuel affordability may be primarily a function of the woman\u2019s, not the household\u2019s budget, and relevant on weekly or even daily timescales, given our respondents\u2019 earning patterns. \u2018Household\u02bc monthly affordability measures may not accurately estimate a low-income user\u2019s ability to purchase clean fuel. Further, our work reveals that this measure on its own, without the context of other needs, will not be a useful predictor of LPG use. Residual income approaches to affordability that consider essential items (rent, food and so on) and gender-specific affordability metrics4 would provide a more realistic picture of clean fuel affordability.</p><p>Our findings call for energy policy to consider that increasing incomes/saving, subsidizing LPG and/or providing purchasing options with relaxed liquidity constraints (for example, smaller quantities4, pay-as-you-go technologies52) are necessary but probably not sufficient to ensure habitual or exclusive LPG use and abandonment of polluting fuels. Simply alleviating liquidity constraints or providing cheaper LPG will not be enough if there are too many other needs and only a portion of household income available for them. To foster exclusive clean fuel use, we may need to pursue direct fuel provisions, such as vouchers for the entire cylinder (unlike the partial cylinder voucher explored in Peru53) or direct, targeted delivery (such as nutritional programming54 or drinking water through pipes or tanker trucks55), that can ensure a public health-consistent level of use. Energy research and policy must understand how fuel purchases are embedded in gendered, that is, separate but not necessarily asymmetric, intra-household dynamics and within a portfolio of urgent unmet needs to increase clean fuel use.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study setting</emphasis></p><p>We conducted this work in Shirati, Rorya District, Mara Region, Tanzania. Shirati is a rural town of ~50,000 on the edge of Lake Victoria near the Kenyan border. Shirati has a tropical climate with light rains from October to December and heavy rains from March to June.</p><p>According to the 2022 census, when our study was completed, the average number of \u2018persons who spent the census night\u02bc56 (pg. 77) living together in the Mara region was five individuals. In Mara, 42.3% of households were female headed, but over half of adults were married (56%)57. According to Tanzania\u2019s 2018 Household Budget survey, most individuals in Mara were 47 years old, had completed primary school (62%); many used a rechargeable lamp (35.3%) or solar lamps (26.6%) as their main source of lighting34. Average monthly household consumption was ~US$207 in 2017/2018. Female heads of households were self-employed (including farming, petty trade and so on), 14% were unemployed, never worked or did not know and 17.5% were unpaid household workers. Only 11.6% of households in the region had at least one member (typically not a woman) with a bank account. We note that these characteristics are for the region and of all individuals not only main cooks (our sample). In Mara, most used firewood (72.9%) or charcoal (23.5%) for cooking, although LPG was available.</p><p>In Shirati, firewood and charcoal could be collected and purchased in every village, and charcoal making was a common small business. For LPG users, 6- or 12-kg cylinders could be exchanged at retail points in the village with the main market, Obwere. To refill, participants had to either walk with the heavy cylinder or pay the extra cost of a motorcycle or three-wheeled delivery cart ( ~ US$1). We intentionally targeted a rural setting as rural communities are disproportionately understudied and are often targeted for improved but not (truly) clean stoves.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sampling and randomization</emphasis></p><p>We randomized both how participants were selected to participate and the order in which selected participants were assigned to the intervention. We relied on a combination of ward-level shapefiles, Google Maps, interviews with village leaders, local knowledge and Python to randomly place ~511 points across Shirati and then invited the main cook from the closest homestead to participate. After baseline data collection, the first author determined treatment distribution order using a random number generator in R.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Participants</emphasis></p><p>Main cooks were approached by our local team to participate. We intentionally targeted main cooks as the most pertinent individual involved in cooking for the household. Further, we needed to train main cooks on LPG use and safety. After a few days to consider our request, we returned to obtain written informed consent. The only eligibility criterion for our selected participants (Supplementary Fig. 1) was that they did not already use LPG for cooking. This was not a limiting criterion as LPG use in the Mara region was 1.4% as of 2018 and similarly low in the study area58. We decided to target non-LPG users to isolate the phenomenon of continued consumption (as opposed to conflating continued use with the upfront cost of the stove that existing LPG users would have paid for already). At baseline in 2021, our respondents reported an average monthly expenditure of US$182 (or US$462.28 at PPP). Most individuals engaged in subsistence agriculture, raising goats or cattle or pursuing small business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Procedures</emphasis></p><p>After establishing eligibility, explaining the study and obtaining consent, we conducted a baseline survey. This baseline collected demographic, socio-economic and energy information. Within 2 weeks, we delivered two 6-kg LPG cylinder/burner sets and trained the main cook on how to safely use the sets. We interviewed LPG suppliers in Shirati when we piloted the study, and they reported that LPG supply was not a concern. However, this was before the trial. During the study, no participant ever reported failing to purchase a cylinder due to a supply shortage.</p><p>The every-other-week follow-up surveys obtained information on the user\u2019s cylinder purchases, the lag time between cylinder refills and their cooking fuel use. During these visits, we also confirmed that both LPG cylinders were still in the home even if empty. A few households asked to give one away to their relative or friend because they were rationing LPG and only needed one cylinder/burner set. We asked that they keep both at least until the end of the trial. We had survey enumerators take photos of all cylinders (and all stoves for that matter) at each visit and report the number of cylinders within the home and those being used. Establishing rapport was of the utmost importance to our research and field team. The local women we hired to work in their own communities assured participants that the cylinders were theirs to keep and just asked that they keep both until the end of the year-long study. Finally, we conducted an endline survey that mirrored the baseline. Each visit lasted about 30 min; our work was made possible by the labour of the women working for and participating in the study.</p><p>Supervisors of the local team delivered a locked deposit box with a key that respondents could choose to keep or give to their local outreach worker, whom we titled Community Technology Workers (CTWs). The CTWs encouraged the use of the lockbox to save for LPG refills. We did not, however, seek to commit participants to saving only for LPG. Most respondents chose to keep the key with the CTW (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The first author worked on the ground with the local team throughout the entire study and held weekly meetings where logistics or any safety/adverse events could be addressed (although none arose).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outcome construction</emphasis></p><p>Pre-specified primary outcomes were purchased refills, the days between running out of LPG and purchasing the next cylinder (\u2018the refill gap\u02bc), categories of LPG use (exclusive, habitual, occasional and none) and biomass (firewood/charcoal) usage33. We counted purchased refills for each participant over their times in control and treatment, respectively. Respondents self reported the day that one or both cylinders ran out and the date on which they refilled one or both cylinders. This allowed us to calculate the refill gap. We categorized each participant at each visit into one of four LPG categories based on their responses to numerous questions, indicating whether they were exclusively, habitually or occasionally using LPG or had failed to refill for an extended period. We prescribed how these categories would be defined in Appendix 6 of our pre-analysis plan (PAP). For example, if a user was categorized as an Exclusive LPG User if the number of meals prepared and the number of meals prepared with gas were equal, the user reported only using LPG, the user reported no firewood or charcoal use in the past 7 days and yesterday and neither the firewood nor charcoal stove is warm. Respondents reported their firewood or charcoal consumption in typically purchased quantities; we translated these into kilograms after weighing numerous bundles/bucket sizes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sample calculation</emphasis></p><p>We overpowered the sample size to provide higher than 80% power to detect a 10% difference in intervention versus control for the rarest outcome we tracked within the entire study, exclusive LPG use, as detailed in our PAP33. We pursued individual randomization at the level of the main cook (our independent unit of analysis) after finding similar coverage and standard errors across our simulations of individual and cluster/community randomization. These simulations were conducted including and ignoring spillover effects and with different levels of contamination and intra-cluster correlation coefficients (PAP Appendix 4). We timed the \u2018steps\u02bc in the step-wedge design to start at week 18 until 30 to balance the number of control and treatment observations. Every participant contributed on average 25 observations (of 26 possible). We had 6,605 control and 6,221 treatment observations. We define attrition as an individual whom we were not able to contact again or who asked to not be involved in the study anymore. We define missingness as a participant whom we were unable to contact during a 2-week period, whether that be because they were travelling or had conflicting schedules, but we were able to survey again; they continued in the study.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistical analysis</emphasis></p><p>We describe the mean and percentage, range or standard deviation of baseline demographic and socio-economic characteristics of participants. We conducted a balance test on key covariates with weights for how many time periods each household contributed to control and treatment respectively to ensure balance across control and treatment observations (Supplementary Table 1).</p><p>We assess treatment impact on refills by constructing a user\u2019s rate of refilling while in control versus treatment (total refills in control or treatment divided by cumulative time in control or treatment). For all other outcomes, we analyse immediate and cumulative impacts of offering participants a saving lockbox. For all, we investigated the immediate treatment impact, which refers to the outcome for the first 2-week time period after entering into treatment. For all, we estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) using logistic regression, which indicates the difference in the mean outcomes between treatment and control groups.</p><p>In an intent-to-treat analysis, we modelled immediate impact of treatment on binary and continuous outcomes using logistic and linear regressions, respectively. We model the rate of refilling over the time periods in control vs treatment using Poisson regression. For binary outcomes, we report robust inference through the bootstrap method, clustered at the level of the participant. For continuous outcomes, we report robust inference, clustered at the level of the participant.</p><p>We also estimated the cumulative treatment impact by finding average impact of each additional 2-week time period in treatment. The initial impact may change over time, as users may adapt to better saving habits or drop off.</p><p>To do so, we model the outcomes against the cumulative time in treatment (9 to 18 2-week periods) with a logistic or linear regression (if binary/continuous) and predict the average. For binary outcomes, we then model this average with a linear regression against all possible time in treatment. That is, we find the additional treatment effect for one more period of being treated. We report robust inference through the bootstrap method, clustered at the level of the participant.</p><p>We control for time since the study began to isolate the effect of treatment from the effect of time as cooking fuel needs can change seasonally and participants over time may dig themselves into a financial LPG hole before even reaching treatment status. This was not pre-specified, so we also include the analysis without controlling for time since the study began in Supplementary Information.</p><p>Although not pre-specified, as a secondary investigation, we repeated all analyses for sub-groups of per capita expenditure: the first quartile (low), the second and third quartiles (mid) and the fourth quartile (high).</p><p>As additional sensitivity analysis for the analysis not controlling for time, we repeat the intent-to-treat immediate impact analyses that does not control for time using double-robust, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). This estimation technique is based on both the calculation of the propensity score and the parametric model specified; if either is correct, the model is robust to bias. We partly modelled this analysis off of cluster RCT evaluated HIV treatment in Uganda (although we pursue individual randomization)59. Although not necessary in an RCT as treatment was randomized, we pursued this approach as sensitivity analysis as it does not rely on any parametric assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data and allow for the adjustment of covariates to increase efficiency without requiring any additional modelling assumptions60,61.</p><p>We conducted a complete case analysis as overall missingness was &lt;5% of observations (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). We had ~1% (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 7) attrition (for example, participants left the study) and missing observations (that is, field team could not contact the participant that specific week) never exceeded 6% for a single time period (Supplementary Fig. 7). No analysis was conducted until after the end of data collection. All analyses were conducted in STATA 16.1 and R studio 4.2.1. Data were collected with SurveyCTO 2.71.4. The study protocol was approved by the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020-02-13013) and by Tanzania\u2019s COSTECH (permit number 2021-465-NA-2021-112 (renewed as 2022-886-NA-2021-112). The study PAP is available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8465\">https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8465</url>. Full replication files for this study are available online, as is the deidentified data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualitative methods</emphasis></p><p>Following the full trial, we conducted a 6-month period of qualitative work that included observations, focus groups, budgetary games and 90 semi-structured interviews. We collected quantitative and qualitative data sequentially62 to understand the reasons behind the respondents\u2019 reported saving and cooking fuel consumption practices. We conducted all qualitative work after the experiment had ended so as to not interfere with the experiment. Further, to align with best practice62, no analysis was conducted until after the end of data collection. Therefore, to structure the interviews to understand the results, we conducted all qualitative work after the end of the quantitative data collection. We used our qualitative results to help interpret the quantitative survey results. Although the trial had ended before the interviews started, participants were allowed to keep both cylinders and their lockboxes. Therefore, the present tense used by interviewees is indicative of the continued use of both the lockbox and LPG.</p><p>After data collection from the survey instrument documenting LPG use and saving patterns ended in March 2023, we randomly selected interview respondents across the RCT participants, stratified by expenditure groups (low, medium and high) and LPG categories (exclusive, habitual, occasional and no LPG use) (Supplementary Table 1). We slightly overweighted smaller categories and conducted interviews in June\u2013July of 2023 and then again in January 2024. The first author and our main research assistant conducted interviews in Swahili; however, if the participant only spoke Luo, the research assistant led the interview. We conducted a total of 90 interviews by which time we had reached qualitative saturation, wherein new interviews were not revealing new insights.</p><p>We conducted four focus groups in May\u2013June 2023 and January 2024 to better understand how respondents spent and saved within their household units across key expenditure categories. Each group consisted of five or six women from a representative sample across villages and expenditure groups. We conducted two more focus groups to present and ground truth our findings (July 2023) with a random selection of participants and with our survey enumerators, who helped us to better understand household responses (January 2024).</p><p>We asked all participants for verbal consent to audio record and also hand-wrote notes during focus groups and interviews. The interviews were transcribed and translated in the weeks following their completion. We performed initial and intermediate coding from interview notes and advanced coding for all transcripts in Dedoose 9.0.107, a qualitative data analysis software. Within this platform, we coded and kept track of frequency of codes to ensure that key themes were representative and comprehensive of all ~90 interviews and focus groups. We discussed emergent themes, category identification and final codes/themes throughout the fieldwork and while analysing the results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitations</emphasis></p><p>Our work may be vulnerable to self-selection bias. We believe this to be minimal as participants did not self select into our programme but rather were chosen randomly from a spatial random sampling approach. Further, only ~5% (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 24) approached individuals did not agree to participate.</p><p>As with all participant-reported data (survey or interview), our results are vulnerable to recall and social desirability bias. We protected against recall and social desirability bias by asking about the previous day\u2019s cooking activities, recent practices saving and purchasing patterns, building rapport and trust with our participants, and triangulating among receipts, photos of all stoves in use and any biomass stoves, survey answers and interview responses.</p><p>Our work was also vulnerable to the risk of contagion where control participants could hear of the treatment and obtain their own lockbox. We modelled this contagion in our PAP to inform our decision to not cluster our intervention; there was minimal impact on our ability to detect an effect (Methods, Sample calculation and our PAP).</p><p>To make our interviews and focus groups as representative as possible, we randomly sampled across LPG categories and expenditure groups from our trial. In the focus groups, we ensured that individuals were representative of the different LPG categories and expenditure categories. We do not, however, present these as experimental results but rather as context and explanation to understand our experimental results. We waited until the experiment was over to interview respondents on their savings habits so as to not change their behaviour mid-experiment and affect our internal validity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inclusion and ethics</emphasis></p><p>The research has included local researchers throughout the research process. The first author built a relationship with the author based at the University of Dar es Salaam in 2016 before she started any research in Tanzania. The local implementation team was included in designing and implementing the study from before the pre-pilot work to ensure it was locally relevant. Study participants from an earlier feasibility pilot for the concept of community technology workers even became enumerators for the larger study, wanting to shape the new study based on their experience. The study protocol was approved by the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020-02-13013) and by Tanzania\u2019s COSTECH (permit number 2021-465-NA-2021-112 (renewed as 2022-886-NA-2021-112). The study posed minimal risk to participants. We have taken local and regional research into account in our citations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Graduate Research Fellowship Program (A.G.-W.), the Global Distribution Fund (A.G.-W.), University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Center for African Studies\u2019 Rocca Dissertation Grants (A.G.-W.), the James and Katherine Lau Climate Equity Fellowship (A.G.-W. and D.M.K.), the Foreign Language and Areas Studies Fellowship (A.G.-W.).

Eisgruber wrote in the report. He also expressed appreciation for campus community members who have \"joined together to provide access, seek scholarly innovation and embrace diversity and inclusion as vital ingredients of the Princeton experience.\"</p><p>The 2023-24 report summarizes the University's ongoing and new efforts in the areas of climate, equity and inclusion, such as the Rose Castle Society, where students from different backgrounds, faith traditions and political orientations learn how people can come together across differences; academic experience, such as the Princeton Alliance for Collaborative Research and Innovation's research projects between Princeton faculty and collaborators at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and access and outreach, such as the establishment of the Program for Community College Engagement to coordinate Princeton partnerships with community colleges in New Jersey.</p><p>Also included in the report are demographic and climate data about students, staff, faculty, postdoctoral scholars and academic professionals. As in past years, the report is only a snapshot of the University's many programs and activities, all of which are open to all members of our community.</p><p>New to the report this year are snapshots that focus on the University's work and progress around four topic areas: how Princeton has enhanced the accessibility of its physical and digital spaces for students, faculty, staff and visitors; the strengthening of University relationships with Native American and Indigenous communities through academic initiatives, external partnerships, historical recognitions and other activities; the expansion of programs for transfer and military-affiliated students enrolled at Princeton and at community colleges in New Jersey; and the continued support for campus community members across faith-based backgrounds to express their spiritual, cultural and secular beliefs.</p><p>Looking to the year ahead, the University will continue to cultivate a sense of belonging for students, faculty and staff through educational, access and outreach programs and events, according to Vice Provost for Institutional Equity and Diversity Michele Minter and Associate Provost for Institutional Diversity and Inclusion Shawn Maxam.</p><p>\"The University will continue to invest in resources to pursue our mission of excellence while fostering a vibrant campus community for Princetonians of all backgrounds,\" Minter and Maxam wrote in the conclusion of the report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126946763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1B-1Y33-S3KR-51NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 30, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.</p><p>The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-green-bank-clean-energy-community-grants-5cf584e68d9061223b86eed3225744e8\">cited it as one of his major accomplishments.</url></p><p>Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><p>Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.</p><p>\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"</p><p>The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/james-okeefe\">hidden cameras</url> to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.</p><p>Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons.

Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.</p><p>The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-green-bank-clean-energy-community-grants-5cf584e68d9061223b86eed3225744e8\">cited it as one of his major accomplishments.</url></p><p>Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><p>Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.</p><p>\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"</p><p>The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/james-okeefe\">hidden cameras</url> to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.</p><p>Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.</p><p>\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d</p><p>The money has already been <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-billions-clean-green-energy-community-grants-8f6c76cb41783a5e838ac4f7f7cce086\">awarded to eight nonprofits,</url> including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund.

Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.</p><p>The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-green-bank-clean-energy-community-grants-5cf584e68d9061223b86eed3225744e8\">cited it as one of his major accomplishments.</url></p><p>Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><p>Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.</p><p>\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"</p><p>The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/james-okeefe\">hidden cameras</url> to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.</p><p>Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.</p><p>\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d</p><p>The money has already been <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-billions-clean-green-energy-community-grants-8f6c76cb41783a5e838ac4f7f7cce086\">awarded to eight nonprofits,</url> including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund.

Zeldin said this amid ongoing scrutiny of the Biden administration's financial dealings, particularly concerning a $20 billion spending initiative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI would really say it's this entire scheme of what to do with the $20 billion where the money is fronted to eight entities. By the way, Free Beacon just came out with a story about an hour ago where $2 billion went to Stacey Abrams' group, even though that group only received $100 in 2023. Yeah, in 2024 they got $2 billion,\u201d Zeldin said when asked what was the most egregious thing he found in the EPA that the Biden administration left behind.</p><p>Zeldin said this was done as a rushed effort by the Biden administration to disburse massive sums in the days leading up to the presidential transition.</p><p>\u201cThese eight entities are all pastor entities to sub-grantees. Many of those sub-grantees are also pastor entities. And the way this whole thing was designed, both the financial agent agreement between Treasury and the bank, the account control agreement with EPA, the bank, and the primary recipients, these were all built to tie EPA's hands behind their back and to ensure less accountability and less oversight,\u201d Zeldin added. \u201cIt was a race against time prior to Inauguration Day to get out $20 billion that the Biden EPA said, as they were caught on camera, throwing gold bars off the Titanic.\u201d</p><p>Zeldin's criticisms didn't stop at fiscal mismanagement. He said that there was a shift in the EPA's mission under his leadership, contrasting it with what he perceives as the previous administration's focus on channeling billions toward-ideologically driven groups under the guise of environmental justice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/12/radical-left-wing-activist-org-sunsetting-grant-program-biden-epa-wanted-to-fund-to-tune-of-50-million/\">(RELATED: Radical Left-Wing Activist Org Sunsetting Grant Program Biden EPA Wanted To Fund To Tune Of $50 Million)</url></emphasis></p><p>\u201cDuring the last four years, you saw this push towards spending tens of billions of dollars to left-wing ideological groups. That's in the name of environmental justice. Well, if you want to help a community that's been left behind, if you're going to spend a dollar, spend it on remediating that environmental issue in the first place rather than giving it to some left-wing activist group,\u201d Zeldin said.</p><p>\u201cI canceled a $50 million grant to the Climate Justice Alliance. They say climate justice is through a free Palestine. As far as the Trump EPA, we are prioritizing first and foremost this core mission of making sure that we have clean air, land, and water.\u201d</p><p>Last week, Zeldin <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/13/trump-epa-moves-to-claw-back-bidens-20-billion-green-slush-fund/\">announced</url> his team's efforts to regain control of funds from Biden's EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program that provided financial support to green organizations investing in technology projects, with several recipients <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/04/biden-epa-billions-grants-green-groups-democrat-ties/\">tied</url> to the Democratic Party. Additionally, the Biden administration allocated $1.6 billion in taxpayer funds to 105 entities, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/12/13/biden-epa-environmental-justice-grants-left-wing-activists/\">left-wing activist</url> groups, through the EPA.</p><p>\u201cOne of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse,\u201d Zeldin said in his Wednesday <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778\">statement</url> posted to X. \u201cWe will review every penny that has gone out the door.

This report, \u201cAchieving Equitable, Climate-Resilient Water and Sanitation for Frontline Communities,\u201d defines specific attributes of equitable, climate-resilient water and sanitation that are key to advancing solutions to the climate crisis.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis report emphasizes tailoring approaches to fit the unique social, economic, and cultural contexts of communities, providing actionable strategies for diverse audiences, including community organizations, utilities, and decision makers at all levels,\u201d said Dr. Shannon McNeeley, lead author and Water and Climate Equity Lead at the Pacific Institute.\u00a0</p><p>Climate change is accelerating climate disasters and extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes, that disrupt and sometimes destroy water and sanitation access, especially for the most overburdened and underresourced communities. The report includes real-world examples of how frontline communities strengthen the climate resilience of water and wastewater systems by building or improving infrastructure, applying innovative technology, implementing nature-based solutions, delivering more equitable management and planning, accessing funding and financing, using local knowledges and information, and building capacity. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis report underscores the transformative power of community-driven approaches for achieving equitable, climate-resilient water and sanitation,\u201d said Kimberly Lemme, Executive Director of DigDeep Labs. \u201cFrom solar-powered water systems on the Navajo Nation to municipal water connections in Appalachia, projects like these demonstrate how tailored approaches restore access to essential services and dignity, health, and resilience for frontline communities facing mounting climate challenges.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The report identifies eight categories of attributes and strategies for achieving equitable, climate-resilient water and sanitation systems. These areas highlight systemic gaps and provide actionable pathways for advancing water equity:\u00a0</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>  Built Infrastructure: Many US water systems are outdated, and millions of people still lack running water or plumbing in their homes.

The organization has served thousands of families across the country through its award-winning and community-led field projects: the Navajo Water Project (Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah), the Appalachia Water Project (West Virginia and Kentucky), and the Colonias Water Project (Texas). DigDeep is a leading force in U.S. water access research, workforce development, and policy advocacy, underscoring its commitment to addressing the sector\u2019s lack of comprehensive data. Notable national reports, including \u201cClosing the Water Access Gap in the United States: A National Action Plan\u201d and \u201cDraining: The Economic Impact of America\u2019s Hidden Water Crisis,\u201d unveiled the harsh reality that over 2 million people in the US live without a toilet or tap at home, which costs the American economy a staggering $8.6 billion annually.

Founded in 2015, the mission of the CWSC is to advance water security and cultivate cooperation by building a unified body of laws, policies, practices, and standards that ensure the availability of water for current and future generations, and a peaceful, stable, and vibrant global society. Ultimately, the CWSC works to ensure that law and practice guarantee water security and universal access to water and sanitation because without good law those people who have access will lose it, and those who don\u2019t, won\u2019t ever get it.

Instead, the House bill would support industrial agriculture practices that have no proven benefits to the climate, such as increasing price supports for industrial commodity crops.</p><p>While the chairman's proposal does include a few positive provisionssuch as support for resolving the land ownership issues that especially impact Black, Indigenous and other farmers of color these do not offset the bill's many problems. It fails to offer meaningful protection for the workers who keep the country's food and farm system running, or to consider USDA Equity Commission recommendations to address discrimination at the agency and ensure farming is accessible to all.</p><p>In addition, the bill would restrict how Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may be updated, limiting science-based changes to the Thrifty Food Plan and therefore preventing benefits from being adjusted to reflect the cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific or dietary guidelines.</p><p>Representative Thompson's proposal flies in the face of clear public support for programs that make farmers more resilient, protect food and farm workers, and help people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. The chairman recently called for a 'tripartisan' farm billhighlighting his motivation to cater to corporate agribusiness as the third partyand this proposal reflects that. New UCS research found that agribusinesses, industry groups and others have spent more than half a billion dollars over the last five years lobbying on issues that include the next food and farm bill and donated $3.4 million dollars to the campaign coffers of three key food and farm bill architects, including Thompson.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at UCS:</p><p>\"The House food and farm bill would eliminate critical guardrails that ensure Inflation Reduction Act conservation investments make farmers part of the climate solution. Farmers are increasingly impacted by severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding. Any final food and farm bill must include support for programs that help farmers adapt to a changing climate while also reducing agricultural emissions that are driving the climate crisis. Climate-focused conservation funding is essential to help farmers make their farms more resilient and must remain designated for this purpose.</p><p>\"The bill is out of line with what the public wants and our food system needs. People across the country strongly support programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. They also support protecting the workers who keep our country fed and want to ensure that small-scale, diverse and young farmers have equitable access to land, credit, and other vital resources. The House bill fails in these respects.</p><p>\"The food and farm bill provides an opportunity to build a more resilient, sustainable, just and equitable food and farm system, for all of us. As it stands, this bill is unacceptable. We urge the House Agriculture Committee to reject this legislation. Congress can and must do better.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126553064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C29-CWF1-JCBF-S0N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 17, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Administrator has wasted no time identifying and eliminating waste and abuse from the agency, taking steps to unleash American energy, overseeing a record-breaking cleanup effort following the California wildfires, ending the Biden-era EV mandate, lowering consumer prices on appliances by rolling back Biden-era regulations and more. He also highlighted President Trump's leadership and vision for a stronger, more prosperous union in the President's Joint Address to Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read what Administrator Zeldin had to say in his exclusive op-ed for the National Review:</p><p>\"The golden age of American success is upon us. In just one month, the Trump administration has achieved more than most presidents accomplish in four years. It's about promises made, promises kept.</p><p>\"I was sworn in as the 17th administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency just one month ago, and we have already taken great strides to power the great American comeback. We are working tirelessly to ensure clean air, land, and water for every American, while simultaneously driving economic growth by unleashing energy dominance, pursuing permitting reform, making the United States the AI capital of the world, and bringing back American auto jobs.</p><p>\"Under President Trump's leadership, the EPA will strive to accomplish all this while fulfilling our commitment to the rule of law, advancing cooperative federalism, and being good stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.</p><p>\"In my first days, I crisscrossed the country while overseeing an unprecedented emergency response, slashed wasteful spending, and championed American energy independence -- all while restoring accountability within the agency.</p><p>\"Working with DOGE, we cancelled $171 million in wasteful DEI and environmental-justice grants and contracts, and another $1 million in media subscriptions; $50 million of this now-cancelled funding went to the Climate Justice Alliance, which believes that 'climate justice travels through a Free Palestine.' The days of shoveling millions of dollars to far-left radical organizations in the name of climate equity are over.</p><p>\"Further, my team uncovered extensive troubling developments with $20 billion in \"gold bars\" that the Biden EPA 'tossed off the Titanic.' These taxpayer funds were parked at an outside financial institution to rush out the door and circumvent proper oversight; $20 billion was given to just eight pass-through nongovernmental entities in an effort riddled with self-dealing, conflicts of interest, and an extreme lack of qualifications. The Department of Justice has been working hard to assist us so that we can remain accountable to American taxpayers.</p><p>\"In just a few short weeks, we have taken significant measures to spearhead America's return to energy dominance. We approved West Virginia's application for primacy over Class VI wells, giving the state primary authority to protect groundwater and bolstering energy dominance. I was honored to join President Trump's National Energy Dominance Council, and have taken action to lower appliance costs for everyday Americans by overhauling the Biden-era WaterSense program. I will work alongside my cross-agency counterparts to slash energy costs for families struggling to heat their homes, fill their gas tanks, and afford groceries, while reducing American dependence on foreign adversaries.</p><p>\"We also ended Covid-era remote work and proudly renamed our Gulf of America division.</p><p>\"I have also taken action regarding California's outsized heavy hand on national vehicle regulations, transmitting the Biden administration's California waiver rules to Congress -- a step that the Biden administration deliberately avoided. This had prevented members of Congress from deciding on the Biden administration's allowing California to create a separate, stricter regime of regulations that provided a different model for states to follow. Congress can now decide the fate of these waivers through the Congressional Review Act. This move protects consumer choice and vehicle affordability.</p><p>\"At President Trump's direction, the EPA executed the largest wildfire hazardous waste cleanup in agency history and finished in just 28 days -- beating the 30-day timeline set for us.</p><p>\"I am committed to understanding firsthand the environmental challenges that communities face rather than managing from behind a desk in Washington. I was honored to join Vice President JD Vance in East Palestine, Ohio, on the two-year anniversary of the tragic train derailment. I also traveled to survey wildfire damage in Los Angeles and met with affected residents. I checked in on hurricane recovery efforts in Western North Carolina and toured improved water infrastructure in Flint, Michigan.</p><p>\"In just 30 days, we have revived both the EPA's environmental mission and its commitment to American prosperity. By prioritizing results over ideology, fiscal responsibility over wasteful spending, and cooperation over confrontation, we are demonstrating that environmental protection and economic growth are complementary.</p><p>\"President Trump will deliver his joint address to Congress today. In it, he will outline his inspiring path forward for our nation. It's about promises made, promises kept as we enter the golden age of American success to achieve a stronger, more prosperous union. This is just the beginning. I look forward to four more years of winning as the EPA does its part to power the Great American Comeback.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-administrator-zeldin-golden-age-american-success-upon-us\">https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-administrator-zeldin-golden-age-american-success-upon-us</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9095059 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9095059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F8J-2X73-RWY2-M2JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><timeReceived>7:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 6, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At least three of the eight organizations that were</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/04/biden-epa-billions-grants-green-groups-democrat-ties/\">selected as awardees are loaded with Democrat Party insiders.</url></p><p>'One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse,' Zeldin said in his Wednesday  <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778\">statement posted to X. 'We will review every penny that has gone out the door. The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.'</url></p><p>Among the awardees  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/national-clean-investment-fund\">selected by the Biden EPA are Climate United, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities, three groups that are taking home almost $14 billion combined to establish financing operations for a wide variety of green technology and energy projects under the GGRF's National Clean Investment Fund. Each of these groups feature combinations of former Obama and Biden administration employees and officials from labor unions and left-wing environmental activist groups on their boards.</url></p><p>Project Veritas, a right-wing activist group, published secretly-recorded footage of a Biden EPA appointee discussing how the agency was 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic' in the final days of the Biden administration and before the Trump administration arrived to curb excessive federal spending. Zeldin referenced the footage in his statement announcing the agency's intent to recover the $20 billion.</p><p>However, the Biden EPA parked the $20 billion at Citibank before the Trump administration's arrival, ostensibly in an attempt to make it more difficult for incoming Trump EPA personnel to access the funds. Zeldin made clear in his remarks that Citibank is not suspected of any sort of wrongdoing with its involvement, but the Trump EPA wants to terminate the underlying agreement with the bank that the Biden EPA signed.</p><p>'Roughly twenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight,' Zeldin said in his statement.</p><p>Zeldin added that he will be referring the matter to the EPA Office of the Inspector General and that his agency will also work with the Department of Justice.</p><p>'Protect the Public's Trust, along with the Daily Caller News Foundation, has been among those sounding the alarm on this greendoggle for over two years now. Many of us recognized the issues and potential for abuse that were likely to manifest themselves due to the manner in which the Biden administration structured the program. Many of the recipient organizations were tied to the Biden administration and its political allies,' Michael Chamberlain, executive director of Protect the Public's Trust, a government watchdog group, told the DCNF. 'In fact, one of the recipients of billions from the GGRF had a board member who was likely involved in creating the program while serving in the Biden White House. What a surprise that EPA awarded funds to this group It appears as though our concerns with this program were more than justified.'</p><p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Dr. Goldman has deep expertise at the nexus of science and policy on topics including federal scientific integrity, climate science and emissions reductions, air pollution exposure and health effects, and environmental justice and science in federal decision making.</p><p>\"Dr. Goldman stood out amongst an extremely talented pool of candidates with her extraordinary vision, government and NGO policy experience, unparalleled science advocacy, and her deep commitment to environmental justice,\" said Dr. Anne Kapuscinski, chair of UCS's board of directors. \"She has wide-ranging expertise that will help UCS advance its mission of using rigorous science to build a healthy, safe and just future.\"</p><p>In recent years, Dr. Goldman served in the White House as the assistant director for environmental science, engineering, policy, and justice in the Climate and Environment division of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where she focused on climate equity, air quality, Indigenous Knowledge, environmental justice, and scientific integrity. She also served as the climate change research and technology director at the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she worked to decarbonize the transportation sector and build community resilience to climate change.</p><p>During the first Trump administration, Dr. Goldman was research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at UCS, where her team documented more than 200 attacks on science from the administration, and where she built a reputation as a thought leader on science and federal policymaking.</p><p>\"Every administration has politicized science in ways that hurt regular people, but my experience tells me this will be a whole new ball game,\" said Dr. Goldman. \"I'm energized for this fight. Together we must uphold the progress we've made to fight climate change and find opportunities at the state and regional level to continue the clean energy revolution that is underway.\"</p><p>A prolific writer, speaker and advocate, Dr. Goldman has testified before the U.S. Congress, served as an expert on the Public Health Rulemaking of the California Department of Conservation's Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), chaired the Air and Climate Public Advisory Committee for the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and served on the UNESCO/AAAS Consultation Group on the U.S. science ecosystem.</p><p>She holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in environmental engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.S. in atmospheric science from Cornell University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126922847</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DX4-GK33-S2VF-B0GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 16, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
