We will be laser-focussed on delivery - creating jobs, enhancing links between our academics, innovators and scientists, and protecting the environment, nature and our people.</p><p>Kenya is a gateway to the East African market with over 300 million people with combined GDP of over USD 400 billion (Kshs.52 trillion). UK-Kenya trade is valued at \\xA31.8 billion (Kshs.218 billion). UK companies are among the largest employers in Kenya. This new partnership will deliver \\xA31 billion (Kshs.177 billion) for the UK economy in export finance, engineering jobs and defence manufacturing jobs in Northampton and County Durham.</p><p>The Partnership will see Lloyd's of London enter the Nairobi insurance market as a gateway to the East Africa Market valued up to \\xA30.5 billion (Kshs.88billion).</p><p>Over the next five years, Kenya and the UK will deliver on high value investment deals of mutual benefit to both economies.</p><p>This includes Nairobi Railway City, a flagship project, which exemplifies what is possible when ambition meets partnership. Railway City is worth up to \\xA3150 million (Kshs.26billion) with the potential for 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in Kenya. Procurement for construction of the first phase of the project has now launched with opportunities ranging from commercial real estate and hospitality to tech innovation and student housing.</p><p>Both countries have agreed to explore a new Digital Trading Agreement and to aim to double trade by 2030 in areas like financial services, digital and technology, and defence and security.</p><p>The Kenya and UK governments will further their global leadership on climate and nature through the Partnership, mobilising at least \\xA3200 million (Kshs.35billion) for Kenyan climate adaptation, keeping the 1.5 C temperature goal in reach and unlocking green energy transitions and nature-based solutions.</p><p>Under science and technology, the Strategic Partnership will harness the potential of science, research, innovation and technology partnerships, including on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies, to drive inclusive growth, job creation and sustainable development.</p><p>Finally, this new strategic partnership will strengthen our joint response to regional terrorism, illicit finance, cyber attacks and organised crime, keeping our people safe.</p><p>Through the UK-Kenya Security Compact, which we signed today, both countries will prioritise efforts to reduce irregular migration, and support regional stability. The renewed Compact is designed to address both traditional and emerging security threats. Priorities include tackling risks from digital spaces and new technologies, reducing irregular migration, and countering illicit finance. The partnership will continue to build on its strong foundation, ensuring that previous achievements are sustained and that new challenges are met with a coordinated, forward-looking approach.</p><p>This high ambition Strategic Partnership will enable us to go far, together, for a more prosperous and secure future for both our great nations.</p><p>Media enquiries</p><p>Email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk\">newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk</email></p><p>Telephone 020 7008 3100</p><p>Email the FCDO Newsdesk (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first instance, and we will respond as soon as possible.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G65-KF23-RRYH-50C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 7, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0007EFP</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (UK)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0008RPR</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (GAMBIA)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6311 LIFE INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp;

Both operations are backed by a guarantee from the European Commission and will help finalise a structural project for drinking water supply in Greater Tunis, the most densely populated region of the country which is faced with growing demand for water.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project includes the construction of a new treatment plant in Bejaoua, laying of water pipelines, installation of pumping stations and construction of reservoirs to serve the entire Greater Tunis region, including future development zones such as Tunis Financial Harbour.</p><p>Faced with a projected 50% increase in demand by 2040, this investment meets a strategic need to strengthen water security in Greater Tunis. It will make a real contribution to providing a reliable and sustainable service in a region with high population growth, against the backdrop of increased pressure on water resources. The additional funding is co-financed equally with Agence fran\\xE7aise de d\\xE9veloppement (AFD) under the Mutual Reliance Initiative (MRI), a cooperation mechanism between European lenders.</p><p>In addition, the EIB is launching a new strategic partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for the benefit of the Office national de l'assainissement (ONAS), the public body responsible for managing sanitation services in Tunisia.</p><p>This partnership aims to promote nature-based solutions (NBS) in order to address water and climate change-related challenges. The study conducted in this framework will focus on the possibility of applying nature-based solutions in cities with fewer than 3 000 inhabitants. Its findings will provide the basis for an event in Tunis on 19 May, aimed at identifying a pilot project to be developed with the support of international partners. This study is in line with the EIB's commitment to strengthening its dialogue with local civil society on projects with major environmental impact.</p><p>EIB Vice-President Ioannis Tsakiris said: Through these two partnerships with the Tunisian government, Sonede and ONAS, the EIB is supporting concrete, innovative solutions focused on people's needs. By ensuring reliable access to drinking water and strengthening wastewater treatment systems via nature-based solutions, our aim is to support the country's resilience to climate challenges. This support fully reflects our commitment to sustainable and equitable development, aligned with the priorities of the strategic partnership between the European Union and Tunisia.</p><p>EU Ambassador to Tunisia Giuseppe Perrone said: The European Union and the EIB are supporting the Tunisian authorities in their efforts to ensure access to the drinking water and sanitation services needed by the people of Tunisia. These new activities are part of Team Europe's 'Water' initiative, which has already mobilised 1.7 billion - or TND 5.7 billion - to ensure access to drinking water and sanitation services in Tunisia, thanks to the combined contributions of the European Union, its Member States and financial institutions such as the EIB.</p><p>A technical assistance contribution of 5 million financed by the European Union and implemented in partnership with the EIB will also help the Ministry of Economy and Planning to prepare a new generation of investment projects in the public sector. This assistance will aim to improve the quality, sustainability and resilience of future projects in key sectors for Tunisia's long-term development. This perfectly illustrates the commitment of the European Union and the EIB to work closely with the Ministry of Economy and Planning on the implementation of priority investment projects for Tunisia.</p><p>These efforts are part of the global approach of EIB World, the EIB Group's arm dedicated to financing outside the European Union, in keeping with the priorities of the strategic partnership between the European Union and Tunisia and the objectives of Agenda 2030. They are also fully consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the European Union and Tunisia, which aims to strengthen wide-ranging, sustainable cooperation built around common priorities such as access to water, climate resilience and balanced territorial development.</p><p>Background information</p><p>About the European Investment Bank (EIB)</p><p>In Tunisia, the EIB finances projects with high economic and social impact in strategic sectors such as education, urban development, transport and energy.</p><p>EIB Global is the EIB Group's specialised arm devoted to increasing the impact of international partnerships and development finance. Within Team Europe, it fosters strong, focused partnerships alongside fellow development finance institutions and civil society. EIB Global brings the EIB Group closer to people, companies and institutions through its offices around the world.</p><p>About the European Union</p><p>The European Union is an economic and political union of 27 European countries. It is based on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of people belonging to minorities.

The nine-metre-tall spider sculpture stands in an exposed stretch of ground outside the Guggenheim Museum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elsewhere, the city offers plenty of shelter for its residents and visitors during this late June heatwave. Plane trees make a cool tunnel of the Gran V\\xEDa, where screens announce the time and temperature; 25\\xB0C at 9pm stops me in my tracks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are 131 'climate shelters' - air-conditioned buildings and green spaces where people can keep cool - publicised this year by an outreach team holding white parasols in addition to the usual channels. Temporary fountains have been set up in the busiest areas of the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm here to find out what goes on behind the scenes to make Bilbao and the Biscay province of the Basque Country an innovator in climate adaptation; a place that does things a little differently from the rest of Spain and Europe.</p><p>From static to dynamic urban planning</p><p>Tecnalia, the largest applied research centre in Spain, resides in a leafy science park above 'el bocho' (the hole) as Bilbao is known, because of its position in the dip of the mountains.</p><p>Within this sleek R&amp;D hub, the Energy, Climate and Urban Transition unit is busy applying advanced technology to some of the knottiest nodes in climate action.</p><p>Patricia Molina oversees the City, Territory and Environment pillar within this unit. An urban planner by training, her practice has evolved with technological breakthroughs - bridging economic, social and other silos, and knitting together different scales to produce a dynamic analysis of the city.</p><p>If you can see almost life on one hand and on the other hand you can make scenarios and anticipate those scenarios and take the measures in advance, I think this is going to completely change the urban planning system, she says.</p><p>Her team can map cities in extraordinary detail. Including, for example, whether an apartment block has an elevator or air conditioning. Combined with demographic stats, it helps them to see where residents are most vulnerable during extreme heat.</p><p>Given Bilbao's vulnerability to river flooding, they have also mapped the city's sewage system and road network, including the number of vehicles and access to alternative routes if a flood strikes.</p><p>And with digital twins - virtual replicas of cities - they can test the efficacy of nature-based solutions, even down to which tree species will have the fastest growth rate under climate change.</p><p>Climate proofing, explains Efren Feliu Torres, head of the climate change adaptation programme, is a crucial concept within their modelling. It means taking into account the fact that the climate is dynamic and will alter the outcome of adaptation measures.</p><p>The intention is improving decision-making. That is the ultimate objective, he says. Tecnalia's analysis feeds into mid- to long-term planning for authorities, helping them to see where investment is most needed and impactful.</p><p>When we show the work we are doing to some municipalities in the south of Spain, they are just amazed because apparently we don't have such a huge problem with heat here, but we are already planning for it, says Molina.</p><p>A unique ecosystem of public and private partnerships</p><p>Tecnalia is roughly half-and-half supported by private and public funding - a collaborative effort fostered by the regional government.</p><p>Another embodiment of this approach is the B Accelerator Tower (BAT), a public-private centre for entrepreneurship housed in Bilbao's second-tallest building. The tallest is the Iberdrola Tower, the headquarters of the Spanish energy company, which dominates the skyline.</p><p>BAT's 200 members include corporate powerhouses like Iberdrola and Triodos Bank, the Basque region's main institutions, and dozens of start-ups. Global consulting firm PwC operates as a 'matchmaker' here, and says it has made 600 matches between entities big and small.</p><p>One such start-up is Woza Labs, which is developing deep-tech foundations to solve climate and sustainability challenges. The Bilbao-headquartered company has partnered with Iberdrola to smarten its grid management, identifying where power lines are most at risk in the short term, and where new ones should be built to maximise their resilience.</p><p>It does this by integrating disparate datasets - including geospatial intelligence and data from the energy company about its facilities and past incidents - into one predictive platform.</p><p>What we're seeing today is that companies, governments, public institutions, they are not ready for measuring climate [...] their systems are not ready to work in a more volatile environment, says CEO and co-founder Sebasti\\xE1n Priolo. With climate change causing fiercer storms, heatwaves and wildfires, that volatility needs to be input in the systems.</p><p>One of the things that wooed Woza's founders to Bilbao from London is what Priolo calls the asymmetry between digitalisation and industry. With a past rooted in heavy industry and an ongoing industrial presence, it's a seller's market for companies offering digital services.</p><p>The Bizkaian government has created a supportive environment for start-ups, he adds.</p><p>Exercising its tax autonomy, the Provincial Council of Bizkaia has incentives to encourage innovation and decarbonisation. The corporate tax deduction for investments in clean technologies has recently been increased to 35 per cent, for example.</p><p>We want to be there among the main European countries concerning innovation, Ainara Basurko Urkiri, deputy of economic promotion in the Bizkaia Government, tells Euronews Green. We need public and private partnerships, she emphasises. If we go hand-in-hand together, we will move forward faster.</p><p>Chasing greener horizons at Bilbao Port</p><p>Bilbao's changing narrative is nowhere better illustrated than at its port, Spain's fourth busiest.</p><p>This, says Andima Ormaetxe, director of operations, commercial, logistics and strategy, is the port of the Atlantic. It is a gateway for the rest of Europe and America, and its history is also that of Bilbao, which was granted city status and control of maritime traffic entering its estuary in 1300.</p><p>Iron ore had long been mined from the surrounding hills, furnishing the armouries of Spanish kings. But extraction became big business in the nineteenth century, spearheaded by British industrialists.</p><p>The meandering Nervi\\xF3n River was straightened en route to the Old Town docks (15 km upstream), which were eventually abandoned altogether as the superpuerto on the bay grew. The Guggenheim Museum was built on a derelict dock district.</p><p>Now, hemmed in by those hills, there is no more room for Bilbao Port to expand. So our generation is the generation in which we have to make the port more effective and efficient with the space that we've got, says Ormaetxe.</p><p>It's clear that decarbonisation is going to be a big opportunity, he adds. The port has invested millions in electrifying its docks; a bank of onshore wind turbines, wave farms and solar panels are part of its plan to be self-sufficient and create an Onshore Power Supply (OPS).</p><p>In the chicken and egg game of working with shipping companies - which say they cannot transition without the infrastructure - Bilbao Port is aiming to make green electricity the cheap option, and raise ambitions around Europe.</p><p>It is also collaborating with the industrial sites at its heels, affording them the space to develop green hydrogen, which is a major part of the region's plans. Precisely because Biscay was a major cog in the industrial revolution, it is now busy building a greener future - working with what it's got, to paraphrase Ormaetxe.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GDS-CFP3-RS14-V46P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1284\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 5, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp;

Launched in December 2024, the GKC capitalizes China's unique development experience, especially in ecosystem restoration, and leverages growing global knowledge including World Bank Group's expertise and global networks, bringing together stakeholders from around the world to exchange ideas, experience, and best practices, all the while promoting the creation of new knowledge.</p><p>Large-scale ecosystem restoration requires a comprehensive approach that integrates science, policy, finance and private sector and community engagement. The GKC will emphasize natural capital as the backbone for economic prosperity and planetary health, and for the provision of important ecosystem services such as hydrological flow regulation, soil retention, carbon sinks, and pollination.</p><p>As the WBG deepens its role as a Knowledge Bank, it is transforming its knowledge architecture to meet client demand for new ideas to tackle development challenges. As a global development bank with offices in 120 countries, the WBG has a unique capacity to deploy a mix of global and country knowledge to help clients tackle pressing development challenges.</p><p>The GKC will provide a knowledge exchange platform for countries facing similar development challenges, and foster impacts through experience dissemination, policy support and knowledge products at a global level.</p><p>The GKC will focus on three interconnected technical areas, together forming a comprehensive approach to ecosystem restoration.</p><p>1. Ecosystem Restoration in the Broader Development Context emphasizes the importance of promoting spatial planning and zoning tools to effectively plan and zone areas for ecosystem restoration. It also involves understanding the drivers of degradation and using integrated planning approaches to address these issues. Additionally, the role of nature-based solutions in contributing to development, climate adaptation, and resilience will be explored.</p><p>2. Developing and Sharing Technical Best Practices involves disseminating best practices in implementing ecosystem restoration at site level. These include soil conservation techniques in degraded landscapes, planning for large-scale forest planting, water-smart planting techniques, solutions for managing droughts and floods, as well as incentives and stakeholder engagement approaches to encourage participation in ecosystem restoration efforts. Attention will be given to leveraging artificial intelligence and remote sensing technologies to enhance restoration efforts.</p><p>3. Financing and Realizing Economic Benefits focuses on the role of environmental-economic data, tools and analysis that go beyond GDP in measuring economic progress, building local and national capacity in making the economic case for restoration, and advancing policies for investing in landscape management (both private and public) to create green jobs and grow economies, ensuring the efficient use of public funds for ecosystem restoration, including identifying and utilizing private sector financing solutions to support restoration projects.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2R-T2S3-RXKW-03HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 19, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000834W</classCode><className>BEST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>BEST (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

This report serves as a crucial guide for executives, business leaders, academics, students, and sustainability advocates, at a time when the world is facing compounded crises and the 2030 SDG deadline is fast approaching.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GCNT also announced the upcoming GCNT Expo 2025, scheduled for 29-31 July 2025 at True Digital Park, Bangkok. This national-level event will bring together stakeholders from all sectors to accelerate tangible progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>SDGs in 2025: The World Must Accelerate</p><p>According to the United Nations, the world is on track to achieve only 17% of the SDGs by 2030. 48% are progressing 'too slowly' and 37% show 'no progress or are regressing.' In the Asia-Pacific region, the UNESCAP report, Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report: Engaging Communities to Close the Evidence Gap 2025, emphasises the ongoing challenges including the climate crisis, economic inequality, and energy insecurity. Thailand, while ranking 1st in ASEAN and 45th globally for SDG progress, still faces critical gaps-particularly in carbon emissions reduction, equality, and human capital development.</p><p>GCNT Launches SDG Report, Announces July Expo</p><p>GCNT Unveils 4 Key SDG Mega Trends Thai Businesses Must Know</p><p>Dr. Thunyaporn Krittiyayawuth, Executive Director of GCNT, stated that the Forward Faster Now report compiles global insights, particularly from the UN Global Compact, and translates them into the Thai context. She emphasised that unless businesses accelerate their adaptation, a stable and sustainable future cannot be achieved.</p><p>As GCNT President Mr.Suphachai Chearavanont has said, 'We have less than five years to achieve SDGs 2030. We must act faster and go further.' This report is a strategic roadmap to guide Thai businesses through today's uncertainty.</p><p>The four key trends are: AI and Digital Technology as a Driving Force</p><p>AI is transforming all aspects of business-from operational efficiency to ESG performance and transparency. Responsible technology use can lead to competitive, sustainable business models.</p><p>Thriving by Mimicking Nature</p><p>Nature-Based Solutions and biomimicry are now central to reducing environmental impact, restoring ecosystems, and creating innovative, sustainable products and services that appeal to the new generation of conscious consumers.</p><p>Accelerating Sustainable Finance Innovation</p><p>Finance is a critical enabler of sustainability. Green finance, sustainability-linked bonds, climate finance, and ESG-linked instruments will be vital for unlocking new funding, enhancing competitiveness, and driving the sustainability transition.</p><p>People-Powered Development</p><p>Businesses must invest in human capital-enhancing capability, fostering responsibility-driven cultures, and empowering employees at all levels to create change from within. This is especially crucial in an era of rapid and disruptive transformation.</p><p>The report also references the Forward Faster initiative by the UN Global Compact, which urges businesses worldwide to act faster on key issues like gender equality, living wages, climate action, water stewardship, and sustainable finance. It includes case studies from GCNT members who have effectively integrated the SDGs into their core business strategies.</p><p>GCNT Rallies Members to Drive Thailand Toward SDG2030</p><p>Dr. Thunyaporn also shared that GCNT Expo 2025 will be a significant milestone for multi-sectoral collaboration. In partnership with leading corporate members, the public sector, and civil society, the event will foster action-based dialogue and cooperation.</p><p>The Expo will engage stakeholders across the value chain, including SMEs, and be open to the public-students, educators, and sustainability enthusiasts are encouraged to participate and learn how to embed sustainability in all aspects of business and life.</p><p>In addition, GCNT and its members plan to establish an SDGs Learning Center to foster continuous learning on sustainable development for employees, partners, and educational institutions. The initiative will promote capacity building among students, supply chain partners, and other stakeholders, ensuring inclusive progress towards the SDGs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG0107202500010029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5N-P7G3-RSFX-S2Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24135\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 1, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Contracts Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY0RTZFMzE0RjkwNDdFQUI5M0U5N0ZFMjYyREMyQzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Time for Payments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI0Mjg4MEQzOTcwNDZCM0E0QzY0Q0Q1NENCMEJFODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTVEQjIxRDAzMUY0NDUyM0E5Q0E1MDZBMEVBNzI1ODQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DREL</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRNL</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS - ENVIRONMENTAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D9E0</classCode><className>HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CUVU</classCode><className>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSDM</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DONF</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

The Canadian Climate and Nature Fund for Private Sector in Asia (CANPA) will support private-sector projects in Asia and the Pacific focused on climate and nature-based solutions while accelerating gender equity. Canada is providing Can$350 million for project investments and Can$10 million for technical assistance.</p><p>ADB will administer CANPA on behalf of Canada to help private sector companies lower their greenhouse emissions, transition from carbon-based operations, and improve their climate resilience. The fund will lower risks to bring viable projects to market that would be unlikely to proceed solely on a commercial basis, while empowering women and girls by supporting their engagement in a just transition. It will also finance nature-based solutions such as sustainable agriculture and aquaculture to protect, manage, and restore ecosystems.</p><p>This fund continues and deepens our decade-long partnership with Canada to help Asia and the Pacific mobilize private capital to advance the fight against climate change, said Vice-President for Market Solutions Bhargav Dasgupta. CANPA will help accelerate the region's transition to low carbon and climate-resilient growth by lowering financing risks and making projects more commercially bankable, with a specific emphasis on empowering women and girls.\"</p><p>The Asia and the Pacific region is responsible for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Strategy focuses on ensuring every penny of taxpayer money spent delivers real returns for working people, through stronger local economies, better jobs and more resilient communities.</p><p>The new flooding programme is proof of that strategy in action. Every \\xA31 spent on flood defences expected to prevent around \\xA38 in economic damage, meaning significant savings for public services, such as the NHS and schools.</p><p>The major funding pledge will bolster the government's mission of accelerating economic growth, by reducing the time and costs businesses face when recovering from floods and empowering them to invest in local areas.</p><p>Environment Secretary Steve Reed said:</p><p>Protecting citizens is the first duty of any Government.

Our priority will continue to be working with the government and local authorities to ensure as many properties are protected as possible.</p><p>The investment will also continue the government's plans to protect cities and towns from the devastating impacts of floodings, including from Oxford to Portsmouth and up to Derby and Blackpool.</p><p>In the Spending Review, the Government also confirmed that \\xA34.2 billion will be spent on the flooding programme over the next three years (2026/7 to 2028/9), which will be focused on both capital and resources such as building new defences and repairing and maintaining existing ones.</p><p>Alongside this, the Government launched a consultation on new proposals to introduce a simplified, more transparent approach to bid for government funding for flood defences. This will benefit councils that have less resource to commit to the application process and will ensure money is distributed more effectively across the country.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2H-R273-S9GR-C1FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 18, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000733</classCode><className>FLOOD CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1FR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DS5Q</classCode><className>WETLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009R7I</classCode><className>LAND RECLAMATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And therefore, pursuing the economic sustainability pillar while making sure that future generations would not be deprived of the opportunity to make use of the environmental resources of the country will also be safeguarded, he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lotilla called on the agency's officials and staff to remain united in purpose.</p><p>To our officers and staff of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, let us work together. Let us show not only our people, our country, but the whole world that we can be exemplars and we will be just like in so far as the sustainable development of the environment and natural resources of the country are concerned, he said. - PNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2H-R273-S9GR-C24S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 18, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

The Mission aligns with EU priorities, including the European Green Deal and with the EIB's role as the EU climate bank.</p><p>EIB Vice-President Ioannis Tsakiris said: Achieving climate neutrality starts at the local level. Cities and regions are on the frontline of the green transition, but they often need advice to turn their ambitions into bankable investment plans. With this agreement, the EIB, thanks to resources provide by European Commission Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, is stepping up to provide that support, helping municipalities across Greece unlock sustainable urban development through targeted advisory support, technical expertise and long-term partnership.</p><p>The EIB experts' advisory services will be tailored to the specific needs and maturity level of each municipality and delivered over a period of up to 36 months.</p><p>This initiative is part of the EIB Group's broader engagement in Greece under the Green Transition and Just Transition agenda. It also supports the objectives of the EU Mission for 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission in which the participating municipalities are involved.</p><p>EIB's role in supporting a climate-neutral Europe</p><p>As the EU's climate bank, the EIB plays a critical role in financing and advising projects under the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.

More than 20 years prior, Tropical Storm Michelle brought devastating floods, battered the coastline, and damaged over 300 homes in Annotto Bay. This time, however, the outcome was different. Thanks to strategic investments in disaster preparedness, Jamaica's defenses held stronger, protecting lives, infrastructure, and livelihoods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For years, Jamaica has been highly exposed to natural disasters, from hurricanes and floods to earthquakes and landslides. With 82 percent of the population living within five kilometers of the coast and the majority of industries and essential services concentrated in vulnerable low-lying areas, the risks have been immense. Recognizing the urgent need for resilience, the Government of Jamaica partnered with the World Bank to implement the Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project, an initiative aimed at strengthening the country's ability to withstand climate and disaster risks.</p><p>Protecting Coastal Communities from Rising Waters</p><p>In Annotto Bay, a small coastal town long plagued by erosion and storm surges, the work of the project was put to the test as Beryl's waves pounded the shore. Historically, severe storms had stripped away the beach, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to the sea's encroachment. However, with the construction of three protective groynes - barriers built to prevent erosion - and a widening of the beach by 12 meters into the ocean, the town was no longer at the mercy of the waves. The project's nature-based solutions performed as designed-while minor sand displacement occurred, the coastline remained intact.</p><p>For the residents of Port Royal Street in Kingston, past hurricanes turned a critical transportation route into a hazard zone, with the road's structural integrity continually threatened by coastal erosion. Now, as part of the project, a newly reinforced seawall was constructed along Port Royal Street to counteract coastal erosion and protect critical infrastructure. This seawall was designed to withstand extreme weather conditions, reducing the impact of storm surges and preventing further degradation of the coastline. During Beryl, the newly reinforced seawall stood firm, protecting not only the roadway but also nearby homes and businesses. Beneficiaries observed tangible improvements, such as stronger coastal defenses and better infrastructure, which enhanced their ability to withstand extreme weather events and maintain safe passage even in the aftermath of storms.</p><p>Keeping Communities Dry: Urban Drainage Upgrades</p><p>Further inland, communities that once suffered from severe flooding saw dramatic improvements. Myton Gully and Church Pen, two areas notorious for rising floodwaters, had undergone crucial upgrades-891 meters of drainage enhancements and 336 meters of bridge rehabilitation. In the past, heavy rains transformed these neighborhoods into waterlogged disaster zones, with flood levels reaching up to two meters. This time, as Hurricane Beryl's downpour tested the system, the upgraded infrastructure functioned as intended. Roads remained accessible and homes were spared from inundation.</p><p>Enhancing Emergency Response with Modern Fire Stations</p><p>The project also addressed critical gaps in emergency response. Before the project, the Jamaica Fire Brigade in Port Maria operated from smaller locations, forcing firefighters to travel long distances from Ocho Rios-resulting in response times of up to 45 minutes during major emergencies. The construction of a new fire station transformed emergency services in the area. When Beryl struck, response times had been cut to under 10 minutes, allowing first responders to quickly manage flood-related emergencies. Similar improvements were seen in Montego Bay and Yallahs, where new and rehabilitated fire stations significantly reduced response times and expanded coverage to thousands more residents. Surveys revealed high levels of satisfaction among communities, with beneficiaries citing improved response times, enhanced firefighting capacity, and stronger community outreach efforts.</p><p>Science and Policy: Strengthening Jamaica's Disaster Preparedness</p><p>Beyond physical infrastructure, the project also strengthened Jamaica's ability to assess and mitigate disaster risks through improved data collection and analysis. One of the most significant achievements was the upgrade of the national seismic monitoring system. Prior to the project, the country's earthquake detection capabilities were limited, with outdated equipment and large data gaps. The installation of new seismic stations, powered by solar energy and integrated into a national network, improved detection accuracy and informed building regulations.</p><p>Additionally, seismic microzonation studies, which analyze how different soil types, rock formations, and topography influence ground shaking during an earthquake, provided unprecedented insights into Jamaica's earthquake vulnerability. By mapping these variations in detail, the studies helped authorities understand which areas are at higher risk and require stronger building regulations or retrofitting measures. Furthermore, a Rapid Visual Screening was conducted to assess structures for earthquake vulnerabilities, allowing authorities to identify high-risk buildings in need of intervention to minimize damage and loss of life. As part of the project, 3,861 residential and commercial structures were evaluated. While over 90 percent passed the assessment, significant structural vulnerabilities were found in critical facilities such as schools and police stations. This risk information was shared with government agencies, building owners, and administrators to guide decisions on further technical assessments, retrofitting, or reconstruction. These combined efforts have been essential for integrating risk-informed planning across government agencies, infrastructure projects, and urban development initiatives.</p><p>A key component of the project was also the development of the National Risk Information Platform (NRIP), a digital portal consolidating hazard and risk data. Designed to serve as a central resource for policymakers, urban planners, and emergency responders, the NRIP's full rollout is expected in 2025. This platform will support evidence-based decision-making, ensuring that future investments in infrastructure and disaster preparedness are informed by real-time risk assessments.</p><p>A Model for Resilience</p><p>As Jamaica continues to face the increasing threats of climate change and natural disasters, the Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project stands as a model of proactive disaster risk management. The project has benefited 1.6 million people, more than 50% of the population-well beyond its initial target-and has significantly strengthened the country's ability to withstand and recover from disasters.</p><p>When Hurricane Beryl struck, the results were clear: stronger infrastructure, better emergency response, and a more resilient nation. The lessons from this initiative will continue to shape Jamaica's approach to disaster risk reduction, ensuring that communities are better protected against the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB0-W703-RVTN-S2D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1216\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

They found that some of the most widespread and damaging droughts in recorded history have hit during the last two years.</p><p>Their new report gathers information from hundreds of government, scientific and media sources to highlight the most acute drought hotspots around the world, including in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Around 35 per cent of the EU and UK fell under a form of drought warning in early June, according to the latest official data, following a record-breaking hot spring driven by climate change. Alert conditions are intensifying in large areas of Ukraine, in some parts of T\\xFCrkiye, as well as in the UK, Poland, Cyprus, Greece, and the south-eastern Balkans.</p><p>Drought is a silent killer. It creeps in, drains resources, and devastates lives in slow motion. Its scars run deep, says UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw.</p><p>It is here, escalating, and demands urgent global cooperation. When energy, food, and water all go at once, societies start to unravel. That's the new normal we need to be ready for.</p><p>Where are Europe's drought hotspots?</p><p>Spain, Morocco and T\\xFCrkiye are bearing the brunt of drought in the Mediterranean, the report confirms.</p><p>Water shortages have hit Spain's agriculture and tourism sectors hard in recent years. By September 2023, two years of drought and record heat led to a 50 per cent drop in Spain's olive crop, causing its olive oil prices to double across the country.</p><p>Meanwhile, in T\\xFCrkiye, drought has accelerated groundwater depletion, triggering sinkholes that endanger local residents and their infrastructure. It also permanently reduces aquifer storage capacity.</p><p>The Mediterranean countries represent canaries in the coal mine for all modern economies, says Dr Mark Svoboda, report co-author and NDMC director.</p><p>The struggles experienced by Spain, Morocco and T\\xFCrkiye to secure water, food, and energy under persistent drought offer a preview of water futures under unchecked global warming. No country, regardless of wealth or capacity, can afford to be complacent.</p><p>Far from being a dry spell, Dr Svoboda adds, This is a slow-moving global catastrophe, the worst I've ever seen.</p><p>Why drought is 'not just a weather event'</p><p>Given the way drought compounds poverty, hunger and energy insecurity, the most devastating hotspots are found outside of Europe, in some of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>More than 90 million people across Eastern and Southern Africa face acute hunger, according to the report, where some areas have been enduring their worst-ever recorded drought.</p><p>In Somalia, the government estimated that 43,000 people died in 2022 alone due to drought-linked hunger.</p><p>Zambia suffered one of the world's worst energy crises in April 2024 as the Zambezi River plummeted to levels that are 20 per cent of its long-term average. The country's largest hydroelectric plant, the Kariba Dam, fell to 7 per cent generation capacity, causing blackouts of up to 21 hours per day, forcing hospitals, bakeries, and factories to close.</p><p>Drought is not just a weather event - it can be a social, economic, and environmental emergency, stresses report co-author Dr Kelly Helm Smith, NDMC assistant director and drought impacts researcher.</p><p>In Eastern Africa, forced child marriages more than doubled as families sought dowries to survive. Though outlawed in Ethiopia, child marriages more than doubled in frequency in the four regions hit hardest by the drought.</p><p>Across the world in the Amazon, the drought upended life for remote Indigenous and rural communities. In some areas, the river fell to its lowest level ever recorded, leaving residents stranded - including women giving birth - and entire towns without drinking water.</p><p>It is a common theme that drought takes a disproportionate toll on women and children.</p><p>The coping mechanisms we saw during this drought grew increasingly desperate, says Guastello.</p><p>Climate change and El Nino are creating 'perfect storm'</p><p>Between 2023 to 2024, an El Ni\u0144o climate phenomenon amplified already harsh climate change impacts, the researchers explain, triggering dry conditions across major agricultural and ecological zones.</p><p>This was a perfect storm, says report co-author Dr Smith. El Ni\u0144o added fuel to the fire of climate change, compounding the effects for many vulnerable societies and ecosystems past their limits.</p><p>The report makes several recommendations to alleviate the impact of droughts, including: stronger early warning systems to save lives; nature-based solutions like watershed restoration; off-grid energy infrastructure; and gender responsive adaptation.</p><p>The nations of the world have the resources and the knowledge to prevent a lot of suffering, Dr Smith adds.

Representing India at the conference, co-hosted by France and Costa Rica, Dr. Singh called for a legally binding Global Plastics Treaty, swift ratification of the BBNJ Agreement, and introduced the 'SAHAV' digital ocean data portal, reinforcing India's leadership in global marine governance.</p><p>Speaking under the conference theme Accelerating Action and Mobilizing All Actors to Conserve and Sustainably Use the Ocean, Dr. Singh emphasized India's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. He outlined India's multi-pronged strategy to combat ocean degradation through science, innovation, and inclusive partnerships. A centerpiece of India's efforts is the Deep Ocean Mission's 'Samudrayaan' project, set to deploy the nation's first manned submersible by 2026 to explore ocean depths up to 6,000 meters, marking a significant leap in scientific capability.</p><p>Dr. Singh highlighted India's progress in tackling marine pollution through the 'Swachh Sagar, Surakshit Sagar' campaign, which has cleaned over 1,000 km of coastline and removed more than 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste since 2022. A draft marine litter policy is in place, and India is actively supporting negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty to establish a legally binding international framework. Additionally, India has expanded its Marine Protected Areas to cover 6.6% of its Exclusive Economic Zone, contributing to global biodiversity goals.</p><p>The minister showcased India's Blue Economy initiatives, driven by the Sagarmala Programme and the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). Over 600 port-led infrastructure projects worth $80 billion have been operationalized, while $2.5 billion in investments have modernized the fisheries sector, resulting in a 10% rise in fish production and the creation of over 1,000 fish farmer producer organizations since 2022. India has also restored over 10,000 hectares of mangroves and implemented shoreline management plans using nature-based solutions, integrating ocean-based climate actions into its Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>India's leadership in global ocean governance was further demonstrated through its co-leadership in 'Blue Talks' with France and Costa Rica and its participation in high-level events, such as the India-Norway side session on Marine Spatial Planning. The launch of the 'SAHAV' portal at UNOC3 enhances India's commitment to transparent, science-based ocean management.</p><p>Urging the adoption of a robust 'Nice Ocean Action Plan,' Dr. Singh called for global investment in innovation, ratification of the BBNJ Agreement, and finalization of the plastics treaty. The ocean is our shared heritage and responsibility, he declared, affirming India's readiness to collaborate with governments, private sectors, civil society, and indigenous communities for a sustainable ocean future. India's proactive stance at UNOC3 signals its transformation from a coastal nation to a global leader in shaping ocean policy.</p><p>Source: DD News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1F-YS23-RRX8-C368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 13, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDREQTU0MUMzNEMxNDFERkEwNzZCRTlFM0RBNDM2OUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM4MzJBQzBEQkMxNDVFNEI0ODI2OTVCQzE2Q0YwRTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Labor &amp;

The event was presided over by Chief Secretary (Delhi), Sh. Dharmendra and Secretary (DoWR) Ms. Debashree Mukherjee was Guest of Honour for the event. Other distinguished speakers and participants included Director General (NMCG), Sh. Rajeev Kumar Mital, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to India Ms. Marisa Gerards, Chief Executive Officer, (DJB) Sh. Kaushal Raj Sharma, Ms. Rebecca Epworth (World Bank); Laura Sustersic Project Director (GIZ), Sh. Rajiv Ranjan Mishra (Chief Advisor, Water and Environment, NIUA), Sh. Sandeep Mishra Member Secretary, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Debolina Kumdu, Director (NIUA) and Prof. C.R. Babu Prf. Emeritus University of Delhi.</p><p>The workshop marked the formal initiation of an integrated planning approach aimed at cleaning and rejuvenating the Yamuna River. The initiative brought together representatives from 14 key departments and agencies, comprising a Multi-Stakeholder Group constituted by the Department of Urban Development, Government of NCT of Delhi. The workshop aimed at fostering a shared understanding amongst different stakeholders about the URMP approach and the process to be adopted to develop the URMP for Delhi.</p><p>In his opening remarks, DG NMCG Shri Rajeev Kumar Mital highlighted the urgent need for an integrated and collaborative approach to rejuvenate River Yamuna. He emphasized that the Urban River Management Plan (URMP) must go beyond being just a document, serving instead as a dynamic planning and action tool grounded in scientific understanding, risk-based assessment, and active stakeholder participation. The framework, he added, is designed to capture the holistic essence of the river and embed river-sensitive thinking into Delhi's urban planning for long-term sustainability.</p><p>Sh. Dharmendra, Chief Secretary, Government of Delhi, in his keynote address delivered a stark message: Yamuna improves, Delhi improves. He called for urgent, visible results, and stressed on a practical and implementable plan as the essence for Yamuna rejuvenation. He underlined the river's role as the city's lifeline, urging stakeholders to embrace responsibility-from upgrading drain treatment and sewage infrastructure to rekindling Delhi's relationship with the river. He expressed need for an urgent action from all stakeholders for river sensitive urban development of Delhi. He stressed on use of URMP framework for catalysing sustainable development of city and improving the quality of life of the citizens of the National Capital.</p><p>Keynote speaker Ms. Debashree Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of Jal Shakti, mentioned that A healthy Yamuna will lead to a healthy life for the people of Delhi, stressing that water management is now central to the urban experience in the era of climate change. Ms. Mukherjee called Urban River Management Plan (URMP) to be more than just a stand-alone document and urged for a collective and sustained movement involving the government, media, partner institutions, and citizens alike, to bring the river back to life and build a resilient future for the capital.</p><p>Delivering a special address, Ms. Marisa Gerards, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to India, spotlighted the deepening India-Netherlands partnership in water management. She emphasized the significance of international collaboration in tackling urban water crises and announced the upcoming Centre of Excellence on Urban Water Resilience-a joint venture with NMCG and IIT Delhi which will play a key role in URMP preparation. Ms. Gerards also highlighted the role of creative public engagement and praised the River Cities Alliance (RCA) for galvanizing collective action around river health. She emphasized that the Dutch concept of Water as Leverage can be integrated in the URMP framework to make it more robust and practical.</p><p>Representatives of World Bank Ms. Rebecca Epworth brought out case study from Australia for Urban River Management and mentioned that it was heartening to see the elements of URMP would obviate some of the mistakes which happened in Australian urban planning and development such as stakeholders' involvement and shared responsibilities, presence of an institutional framework etc. World Bank expressed its commitment and support for URMP preparation. Representatives of IIT (Delhi) mentioned the importance of data in URMP process particularly that related to flood risk assessment and management. IIT (Delhi) will focus on Urban Flooding aspect of URMP. Professor C. R. Babu mentioned the importance of Nature Based Solutions and focus on biodiversity as a key to Yamuna rejuvenation.</p><p>The workshop presented a detailed overview of the URMP's structure and roadmap. It emerged that the plan, will be prepared jointly by NIUA and IIT Delhi and would be supported by the upcoming Centre of Excellence with Dutch collaboration. The URMP would aim to tackle pollution, improve wetland management, encroachments, and promote water reuse through coordinated, multi-agency interventions. Notably, the plan will be monitored through the new Urban River Management Index, tracking improvements across ten key domains. The project is set to culminate in actionable projects and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), funded through a blend of government, viability gap, and ULB resources.</p><p>The workshop featured interactive sessions, quizzes, and activities, underscoring the importance of public participation in river revival. It was stressed that the success of the URMP hinges on broad-based engagement and sustained, cross-sectoral cooperation. With today's workshop, Delhi signals its resolve to reclaim the Yamuna-not just as a water body, but as the heart of a resilient and vibrant city.</p><p>As the workshop concluded, the message echoed with clarity and conviction-Delhi is ready to reclaim the Yamuna, not just as a river, but as the heart of the city's identity and resilience. The Urban River Management Plan marks a transformative shift from fragmented efforts to a unified, action-driven vision for river restoration. Backed by scientific insight, global cooperation, and empowered citizen participation, this initiative promises more than environmental revival-it signals a cultural and civic awakening. The rejuvenation of the Yamuna is not a distant hope, but a bold, collective journey that has already begun.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G95-8N23-RYDT-J3CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 21, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Community Redevelopment</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUMwM0U5RjhBRkQ1NEQ5Qzk0RDk2QUJDNEU2NTVCQjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY3NUIxODI2RjU2NEY0NzgwMDQyNjFDMEQ1QUExRjM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

While the challenges ahead may be daunting, they also present opportunities to rejuvenate, reinvent and reimagine our cities. Platforms like the Mayors Forum enable cities to come together to learn from one another, and to foster greater dialogue, partnerships and collaboration, as we work towards the common goal of building a more liveable and sustainable futures for all.</p><p>4 At the conclusion of the 14th Mayors Forum of the World Cities Summit in Vienna, Mayor Michael Ludwig emphasised that cities are not just places to live but vital engines of innovation and collaboration. He pointed out that Vienna, the host city of the Mayors Forum, serves as a model for local solutions to global challenges. Ludwig also noted that sharing experiences and best practices allows participants to inspire one another and take meaningful action. He stressed the importance of continued collaboration and forming partnerships that transcend borders, stating that such cooperation is key to successfully addressing future challenges.</p><p>5 Mayors and city leaders also supported the following conclusions after the discussion sessions:</p><p>a. Overall, cities must champion the provision of affordable, sustainable, and accessible housing, municipal services, and resources for their citizens. This can be achieved by streamlining policies and regulations across stakeholders, enhance funding models, and fostering citizen participation to be responsive to the needs of their communities. It is also crucial to forge partnerships across public, private and people sectors for better collaboration and alignment for improved outcomes.</p><p>b. They should also invest in leadership development, timely updates to infrastructure, apply data-driven decision-making, and implement smart city solutions for better coordination, efficiency, and reliability of services for citizens.</p><p>c. In a time of rapidly intensifying climate change, cities can adopt comprehensive approaches to mitigate climate-related risks and incentivise the adoption of clean energy technologies to reduce carbon emissions and ensure smooth energy transition. They should also integrate resource management with green and nature-based solutions-ensuring access to affordable, clean and safe water and energy for all.</p><p>World Cities Summit 2026, Singapore, 14 - 16 June 2026</p><p>6 The next Mayors Forum will reconvene in Singapore as a key highlight of the World Cities Summit (WCS) 2026, taking place from 14 - 16 June 2026. The upcoming edition will be the 10th edition of WCS, marking a significant milestone in advancing discussions and knowledge exchange between cities', industry and academia, around liveability and sustainability issues.</p><p>7 Themed Liveable and Sustainable Cities: ACT Now!, we invite cities to consider how to Accelerate, Collaborate and Transform. This milestone 10th edition of WCS celebrates how cities are transforming through bold leadership and partnerships, to actively shape a more liveable future for all.</p><p>8 The 10th edition of WCS will also see the introduction of new partners, including Expo Real Asia Pacific and WRLDCTY. Notably, WRLDCTY signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Centre for Liveable Cities, the co-organiser of World Cities Summit earlier this year, establishing a framework for knowledge exchange and international collaboration. As part of the partnership, parties will collaborate on WCS and knowledge-sharing platforms. These partners will also provide fresh perspectives at WCS 2026, enriching conversations on sustainable innovation, and strengthening the platform for city leaders and other stakeholders to exchange transformative ideas.</p><p>9 WRLDCTY will also bring the global WRLDCTY conference to Singapore for the first time alongside World Cities Summit 2026 and the launch of a new track to promote a more holistic approach to liveability and sustainability.</p><p>10 More details on the 10th edition of the Word Cities Summit may be found on the website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg\">https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg</url>/</p><p>Annex A: List of attending cities at Mayors Forum 2025</p><p>1.

The resolution highlights the urgency of addressing challenges such as climate risks, infrastructure gaps, overcrowding and social inequalities amid fast-paced urbanization.</p><p>The solutions lie within the diversity of our region, shared United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana in her closing remarks. We have deftly navigated through past crises and emerged stronger together. Our capabilities will provide solutions to our contemporary challenges and allow us to anticipate those that have yet to emerge.</p><p>Governments committed to expanding regional and subregional partnerships to share know-how, align urban policies with the Sustainable Development Goals, and support local authorities in building livable and inclusive cities. The resolution calls for greater investment in digital innovation, low-carbon transport, nature-based solutions and climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure.</p><p>The resolution also recognizes the critical role of city leaders and community networks in shaping urban futures. It encourages local action through integrated planning, sustainable financing and climate-smart strategies that respond to unique national and local contexts.</p><p>As the region becomes increasingly urban, countries emphasized the importance of ensuring equitable access to services for all, advancing gender equality, and creating employment and entrepreneurship opportunities that leave no one behind.</p><p>A second resolution adopted at the session responds to intensifying water-related challenges driven by climate change in the region. ESCAP member States expressed concern over increasing water stress, the growing frequency and severity of water-related disasters, and the alarming retreat of mountain glaciers and thawing permafrost, which threaten both ecosystems and livelihoods. It urges countries to adopt integrated water management approaches, enhance institutional capacity, invest in resilient infrastructure, and involve youth, civil society and communities in decision-making.</p><p>Another key outcome from the session focuses on the need for targeted international support to help middle-income countries address ongoing development hurdles. The adopted text advocates moving beyond income-based metrics by incorporating vulnerability indices and underscores the value of South-South and triangular cooperation, while reiterating that these efforts must complement, not replace, North-South cooperation. Countries additionally adopted a fourth ESCAP resolution reaffirming their commitment to advancing digital inclusion and transformation in the region.</p><p>Around a thousand delegates from 43 member States, associate members and observer countries as well as various stakeholder groups and international organizations attended the session held from 21 to 25 April in Bangkok.</p><p>For further information: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unescap.org/events/commission81\">https://www.unescap.org/events/commission81</url></p><p>Multimedia Assets: <url normalizedValue=\"https://trello.com/b/v1fdCBus/cs81\">https://trello.com/b/v1fdCBus/cs81</url></p><p>(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYS-96F3-RRP4-B247-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 5, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001778</classCode><className>URBAN DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSKB</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE CITIES &amp;

The Dartmoor Headwaters Project offers farmers and landowners in the Okement, Bovey, Dean Burn, Mardle, Erme, Yealm, Colleybrook, and Blackbrook catchments support to design, fund and deliver nature-based solutions.</p><p>Pamela Woods of Dartmoor National Park said:</p><p>The effects of flooding can be devastating, causing significant damage to homes, businesses, roads and nature. By 2070 we are predicted to experience 30% more rainfall, resulting in 41% higher river flows.</p><p>The film conveys complex issues in a positive way while showing how support and funding can help people deliver nature and climate-based solutions.</p><p>It is wonderful to see the vital role moorland farmers play in mitigating the risks of flooding. We hope people enjoy and learn from 'Farming the Flood'.</p><p>Tom Dauben, flood and coastal risk management senior advisor at the Environment Agency, said:</p><p>Whilst Dartmoor's rivers and farms are the subject of this film, it highlights the really important role famers across the country can play to increase resilience of the environment and communities to the threats of the climate and biodiversity crisis.</p><p>Every field has a part to play in tackling these issues, and it's great to showcase some of the work being done locally by farmers, landowners and managers in the film.</p><p>The documentary explores the crucial role uplands can play in flood mitigation, showcasing practical solutions from reintroducing wetlands and floodplain meadows to innovative grazing techniques that restore ecosystems while maintaining productive farms.</p><p>These techniques slow water flow, reduce downstream flooding, and enhance carbon capture and storage - delivering multiple benefits for communities, wildlife and farmers themselves, including making river catchments resilient to climate change pressures such as increased flood risk and heightened risk of drought.</p><p>Harrison Wood, filmmaker, said:</p><p>The farmers featured in this film aren't waiting for top-down solutions - they're acting now.</p><p>By working with nature rather than against it, they're demonstrating how farming can be a key player in tackling environmental challenges.</p><p>Co-director Nick Viney, a landscape restoration specialist with decades of experience in nature recovery, provided expert context for these pioneering approaches throughout the film.</p><p>'Farming The Flood' highlights that many of these initiatives are accessible through government and private grants, making them available to farmers of all backgrounds and scales.</p><p>To learn more about the Headwaters Project, please visit Dartmoor Headwaters Natural Flood Management Project or contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:headwatersnfm@dartmoor.gov.uk\">headwatersnfm@dartmoor.gov.uk</email></p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G00-BV43-RT3G-Y4BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 6, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

At the United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, Agence Fran\\xE7aise de D\\xE9veloppement (AFD), European Investment Bank (EIB), Kreditanstalt f\\xFCr Wiederaufbau (KfW), Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) together with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which joins the initiative as a new member, set a financing target of 3 billion ($3.4 billion) for the years 2026 to 2030.</p><p>Launched in 2018 and extended in 2022, the Clean Oceans Initiative is the largest multilateral effort dedicated to funding projects that reduce plastic pollution at sea. In May this year - seven months ahead of schedule - the initiative met its target of 4 billion in long-term financing for public and private sector projects aimed at reducing discharge of plastics, micro-plastics, and other litter into the oceans through the improved management of solid waste, wastewater, and stormwater. Project examples include improved wastewater treatment in the People's Republic of China, Egypt, South Africa, and Sri Lanka; solid waste management in Senegal and Togo; and flood protection in Benin, Ecuador, and Morocco.</p><p>According to the United Nations, if current trends continue, the amount of plastic waste entering aquatic ecosystems could triple-from around 11 million tonnes in 2021 to 23-37 million tonnes per year by 2040. The new phase of the Clean Oceans Initiative is the international financial community's response to these challenges. COI 2.0 will maintain its focus on reducing marine litter, while increasing its impact by placing a stronger emphasis on waste prevention and supporting circular economy solutions, including projects that develop alternatives to plastic.</p><p>Some of the highest amounts of plastic enter the ocean in Asia, making it essential to join forces with local partners. ADB brings crucial regional expertise to the initiative and will be able to leverage projects in its area of action. Going forward, one of the objectives of this public development bank collaboration is to measure the impact of the enhanced initiative using scientifically robust and easy-to-apply indicators, especially in the areas of plastic pollution prevention.</p><p>Asia and the Pacific is home to the world's richest marine biodiversity but also faces some of the most urgent ocean threats. ADB is supporting its developing member countries to advance sustainable and resilient blue economies. Through the Clean Ocean Initiative, we will help integrate ocean health into key sectors and unlock greater access to scaled-up investments, said ADB Vice-President for Sectors and Themes Fatima Yasmin.</p><p>Before joining the initiative, ADB had already made a number of investments in this area. ADB's Healthy Oceans Program mobilized nearly $4 billion in cumulative ocean investments between 2019 and 2024, with an ambition to scale up further. The program helps de-risk nature-based solutions and attract private capital into sectors typically underserved by traditional finance. Approximately 45% of all ocean-related projects at ADB are focused on waste and wastewater management that reduce pollution entering marine ecosystems.</p><p>ADB is a leading multilateral development bank supporting inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific. Working with its members and partners to solve complex challenges together, ADB harnesses innovative financial tools and strategic partnerships to transform lives, build quality infrastructure, and safeguard our planet. Founded in 1966, ADB is owned by 69 members-50 from the region.</p><p>Source: The Asian Development Bank</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1F-YS23-RRX8-C375-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 13, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

India also backed the swift ratification of the BBNJ Agreement, advocated for a legally binding Global Plastics Treaty, and launched the 'SAHAV' digital ocean data portal, underscoring its growing leadership in global marine governance.</p><p>Addressing the conference, which is co-hosted by France and Costa Rica under the theme Accelerating Action and Mobilizing All Actors to Conserve and Sustainably Use the Ocean, Dr. Jitendra Singh reaffirmed India's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. He outlined how India's initiatives are aimed at reversing ocean degradation through science, innovation, and inclusive partnerships.</p><p>A key highlight was the progress on the Deep Ocean Mission's 'Samudrayaan' project, which is expected to deploy India's first manned submersible by 2026. The project aims to explore ocean depths up to 6,000 meters and is seen as a major leap in India's scientific capability.</p><p>Dr. Jitendra Singh also spoke of expanding India's Marine Protected Areas, which now cover 6.6% of the Exclusive Economic Zone, contributing to global biodiversity goals.</p><p>On marine pollution, the Minister pointed to tangible outcomes from the 'Swachh Sagar, Surakshit Sagar' campaign, which has cleaned over 1,000 km of India's coastline and removed more than 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste since 2022. The draft marine litter policy has been prepared, and India continues to support negotiations on a Global Plastics Treaty aimed at a legally binding international framework.</p><p>India's Blue Economy efforts, led by the Sagarmala Programme and the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), were also showcased. Over 600 port-led infrastructure projects worth $80 billion have been operationalized, and investments of $2.5 billion have gone into modernizing the fisheries sector. The government reported a 10% rise in fish production and the creation of over 1,000 fish farmer producer organizations since the last UN Ocean Conference in 2022.</p><p>Emphasizing climate resilience, Dr. Jitendra Singh noted the restoration of over 10,000 hectares of mangroves and the implementation of shoreline management plans using nature-based solutions. India has also integrated ocean-based climate actions into its Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>India's growing role in global ocean governance was evident through its co-leadership in 'Blue Talks' with France and Costa Rica, and its active participation in high-level events such as the India-Norway side session on Marine Spatial Planning. The launch of the 'SAHAV' portal during the conference further adds to its credentials in promoting transparent, science-based ocean management.</p><p>Calling for a robust 'Nice Ocean Action Plan', Dr. Jitendra Singh urged the international community to invest in innovation, ratify the BBNJ Agreement, and finalize the plastics treaty. The ocean is our shared heritage and responsibility, he said, expressing India's readiness to work with all stakeholders-governments, private sector, civil society, and indigenous communities-to ensure a sustainable ocean future.</p><p>The Indian delegation's participation at UNOC3 signals a clear message: India is positioning itself not just as a coastal nation but as a proactive player in shaping global ocean policy.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G18-7333-RV7B-M0DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 12, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001235</classCode><className>OCEANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5V</classCode><className>OCEAN HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQY8</classCode><className>BLUE ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQZA</classCode><className>BLUE GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

It is more important now than ever that we invest in protecting our freshwater to build a cleaner, safer and sustainable future for all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Great Lakes Watershed is a critical freshwater system that we have here in Canada. It supports industry, recreation, ecosystems, and culture. It also holds spiritual and cultural significance for Indigenous peoples and their way of life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and Minister responsible for the Canada Water Agency, announced an investment of $9.3 million in 26 freshwater projects in the Great Lakes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These projects are delivered through the Canada Water Agency's Great Lakes Freshwater Ecosystem Initiative. Each project addresses key environmental challenges affecting water quality and ecosystem health in the region. They are also key in advancing Canada's commitments under the Canada-United States Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Each of these initiatives is community-led, facilitating collaboration on freshwater science and management.</p><p>Among the funded projects, four will support freshwater restoration in Hamilton and Burlington, representing a $1.6 million investment over four years:</p><p>Royal Botanical Gardens will receive up to $150,000 to enhance habitat resilience in Cootes Paradise Marsh in the Hamilton Harbour Area of Concern through invasive species control, shoreline restoration, and ecological monitoring. Hamilton Region Conservation Authority will receive up to $228,000 to engage landowners in implementing watershed improvement initiatives that reduce nutrient and sediment runoff in the Hamilton Harbour Area of Concern. Halton Region Conservation Authority will receive up to $242,000 to develop a science-based nutrient management plan for the Grindstone Creek watershed. This includes analyzing water quality data, identifying nutrient sources, and engaging stakeholders to recommend targeted best management practices. The Regional Municipality of Halton will receive up to $995,000 to restore two kilometers of shoreline and dune ecosystems at Beachway Park in Burlington using nature-based restoration approaches. This investment will help improve water quality in the Hamilton Harbour Area of Concern and throughout the Great Lakes. Local projects like these drive measurable improvements in water quality and ecosystem health across the region. These projects are also creating lasting economic and social value by supporting sustainable fisheries, protecting drinking water sources, restoring vital habitats, and engaging local communities and landowners in stewardship efforts that strengthen both environmental resilience and regional well-being.</p><p>Through the newly established Canada Water Agency, the Government of Canada is strengthening coordination and collaboration with provinces, territories, and Indigenous peoples to address freshwater challenges and opportunities in the Great Lakes and across the country. These efforts are part of a broader commitment to building a cleaner, more secure, and more prosperous future, because when we protect our water, we protect what makes Canada strong.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>Freshwater is at the heart of our communities, and the Great Lakes are among our most precious shared resources. By investing in these community-led projects, we're taking meaningful steps to restore and protect this vital ecosystem-ensuring clean water, cultural preservation, and a stronger and more sustainable Canada for generations to come.</p><p>- The Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for the Canada Water Agency</p><p>Protecting and rehabilitating our freshwater is vital for both our environmental and human health. Our community sits on the shores of Lake Ontario. The projects supported today are vital for the viability, protection and sustainability of our freshwater resources locally. We must continue to prioritize freshwater stewardship today and for generations to come.</p><p>- The Honourable Karina Gould, Member of Parliament for Burlington</p><p>Royal Botanical Gardens is thrilled by the continued investment in the recovery of our region's two major coastal marshes within the Hamilton-Burlington communities. These wetlands are vital habitats and serve as powerful indicators of regional ecological health. The progress seen, especially in Cootes Paradise Marsh, highlights the success of the combined HHRAP partner water quality improvement investments.</p><p>- Lindsay Barr, Manager of Ecosystem Stewardship, Royal Botanical Gardens</p><p>Hamilton Conservation Authority (HCA) is grateful to receive funding from the Canada Water Agency for the Hamilton Harbour Watershed Stewardship Project. This support will enable HCA and Conservation Halton to collaborate with local residents and community groups to restore natural areas and enhance water quality across the watersheds of Hamilton Harbour. Caring for private lands through our stewardship program is an effective way to protect water resources and watershed health, reflecting our ongoing commitment, as outlined in our strategic plan, to collaborate on watershed-wide environmental goals.</p><p>- Lisa Burnside, Chief Administrative Officer, Hamilton Conservation Authority</p><p>Thanks to the funding provided by the Canada Water Agency, Conservation Halton will develop a watershed-scale nutrient management plan for the Grindstone Creek. For over two decades, Conservation Halton has been actively collaborating with all levels of government and the local community to advance freshwater science, monitoring, and restoration in the Great Lakes Areas of Concern. This initiative is critical in continuing to advance the identification of key nutrient sources, assess trends, and prioritize areas for targeted interventions on a watershed scale to address water quality and algal blooms in Hamilton Harbour.</p><p>- Chandra Sharma, President and CEO, Conservation Halton</p><p>\"Halton Region is proud to lead a collaborative effort with Conservation Halton and the City of Burlington to make Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park more resilient to climate change. This project will restore the park's natural beach and dune system using nature-based solutions that protect the environment while preserving public access. By rebuilding eroded dunes, we're helping to shield the shoreline from erosion and the effects of flooding, high water levels, and storm damage-protecting this special part of our waterfront for today's community and future generations.\"</p><p>- Gary Carr, Halton Regional Chair</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>This $9.36 million investment for the Great Lakes Freshwater Ecosystem Initiative is distributed over four years. Starting in 2023, the Government of Canada is investing $650 million over 10 years in the Freshwater Action Plan, including a historic incremental investment of $420 million to protect the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes provide drinking water to one in four Canadians and are vital to our health, ecosystems, and economy. The Great Lakes region and its basin account for 30% of the combined economic activity of Canada and the United States (~$8 trillion CAD annually). The Canada-United States (U.S.) Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement has guided joint efforts to protect these vital waters since 1972. The Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health outlines cooperative efforts to restore and protect the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem. Areas of Concern are locations where water quality and ecosystem health have been severely degraded by human activity. These include beach closures, habitat loss, and impacts on fish and wildlife populations. Under the Canada-U.S. Agreement, 43 such areas were identified-12 in Canada and five shared binationally. Since 1987, five Areas of Concern have been delisted or designated as Areas in Recovery.

The project will directly benefit over 100,000 people through enhanced road connectivity and expanded electricity access.</p><p>The Gambia Infrastructure Project will focus on building climate-resilient infrastructure while supporting the country's ambitious goals of universal energy access and improved rural connectivity. Key investments include constructing 60 kilometers of rural and urban roads, connecting 80 rural communities to the electricity grid, and upgrading critical energy infrastructure in the Greater Banjul Area.</p><p>The Gambia has made progress toward universal electricity access and is positioned to achieve this goal by 2030, building on the M300 initiative. This project leverages that success while also addressing critical infrastructure gaps that leave over 400,000 Gambians without reliable road access, said Franklin Mutahakana, World Bank Group Resident Representative in The Gambia. \"By strengthening both energy sector efficiency and transport connectivity, The Gambia is creating integrated infrastructure solutions that reduce costs for consumers while improving access to markets and essential services for rural communities.\"</p><p>The project includes innovative approaches such as the development of an active mobility corridor with dedicated bicycle lanes, solar-equipped street lighting, and a credit enhancement mechanism to unlock $60 million in private investment for renewable energy development aimed at reducing the cost of energy production. These initiatives align with The Gambia's Long-Term Climate-Neutral Development Strategy 2050.</p><p>This landmark operation represents a significant milestone in the World Bank's partnership with The Gambia, marking the institution's renewed strategic engagement in the transport sector. This achievement builds on two years of comprehensive analytical work, including the Infrastructure Sector Assessment Program (InfraSAP), and extensive dialogue with Gambian authorities to develop a robust foundation for sustainable infrastructure development.</p><p>\"Technical assistance will support the modernization of vehicle inspection and emission testing systems, helping improve the overall quality and safety of The Gambia's transport fleet, said Hatem Chahbani, Senior Transport Specialist and Co-Task Team Leader of the project at the World Bank. The project also includes developing comprehensive implementation roadmaps for fleet renewal schemes that will help transport operators access financing to upgrade their vehicles, ultimately improving service quality and reducing operational costs.\"</p><p>Building on The Gambia's electricity sector transformation supported by sustained World Bank investments since 2016, the project addresses critical grid stability challenges that continue to disrupt daily life and economic activities in urban areas.</p><p>\"Strategic grid investments will accommodate increasing renewable energy sources while improving overall system reliability. The approach aims at upgrading two primary substations and replacing overloaded secondary substations to enhance urban grid stability,\" said Matar Touray, Energy Specialist and Co-Task Team Leader of the project at the World Bank. \"The rural electrification component is designed to extend the grid to connect communities within 2 kilometers of existing infrastructure, supporting the country's goal of universal access by 2030.\"</p><p>The project will construct approximately 142 kilometers of medium voltage lines, 350 kilometers of low voltage lines, and 92 substations to expand rural electricity access. Urban improvements include upgrading two primary electrical substations and replacing 10 overloaded secondary substations to enhance grid reliability. Road investments will focus on climate-resilient standards using both engineering and nature-based solutions.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FY4-D3P3-RSH3-H3B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 2, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DT89</classCode><className>ACCESS TO ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926130GJ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMX1</classCode><className>CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSX3</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DPLV</classCode><className>RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D32N</classCode><className>VEHICLE INSPECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPS0</classCode><className>ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES &amp;

The Government of Luxembourg is making the commitment to a new fund dedicated to the sustainable use of ocean resources - an area of activity known as the blue economy - and EIB Global is managing the contribution to ensure its optimal use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Luxembourg's pledge will take the form of junior equity in the Outrigger Impact Fund I, which has a target size of $100 million and will be run by UK-based fund manager Outrigger Impact. The fund will operate in Small Island Development States, providing debt and equity finance to projects in various blue economy sectors such as sustainable aquaculture, ocean conservation, ecotourism and offshore renewable energy.</p><p>This investment reflects our ambition to drive more capital towards climate resilience where it is most urgently needed. By backing the Outrigger Impact Fund I through the provision of junior equity, we aim to de-risk innovative projects in the blue economy and mobilise private finance at scale. This is a targeted use of public capital to unlock impact where markets alone would not go, said Luxembourg Minister of Finance Gilles Roth.</p><p>Over the last decade, Luxembourg has been committed to supporting the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change. Small Island Development States are disproportionally affected and face a finance gap at the same time. The blue economy offers an opportunity for SIDS to help adapt to climate change, protect and restore nature, while generating sustainable income for the most vulnerable communities, said Minister of Environment, Climate and Biodiversity Serge Wilmes.</p><p>EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle and Outrigger Impact Managing Director Simon Dent announced Luxembourg's contribution at the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, France.</p><p>Small Island Developing States are disproportionately at risk of the impacts of climate change and receive immeasurably less financing than other developing or low-income countries. That's why this fund is important - at the portfolio level it is expected to multiply investments with a significant leverage, said Vice-President Fayolle.</p><p>The involvement of Luxembourg and the EIB in the new fund advances an EU goal in its Global Gateway Investment Agenda to deepen worldwide cooperation on investment in areas including climate and the environment.</p><p>The investments by the new fund will reduce greenhouse gas emissions through clean transport, contribute to conservation of protected areas and coral reefs, and reduce pollution including plastics in the ocean. The financing will also increase the resilience of local communities to climate change.</p><p>The fund will leverage private investments and group projects across Small Island Development States to support new or small market players that are developing innovative business models backing the transition to a sustainable blue economy.</p><p>This new fund will provide catalytic investment in projects, small and medium-sized enterprises and nature-based solutions in Small Island Development States. These states steward over 30% of our oceans through their exclusive economic zones, meaning that their blue economies, ecosystems and sustainable marine assets are full of environmental, social and economic potential, said Outrigger Impact Managing Director Simon Dent.</p><p>Background information</p><p>About EIB Global</p><p>The European Investment Bank (ElB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union, owned by the Member States. It finances investments that pursue EU policy objectives.</p><p>EIB Global is the EIB Group's specialised arm devoted to increasing the impact of international partnerships and development finance, and a key partner of Global Gateway. It aims to support 100 billion of investment by the end of 2027 - around one-third of the overall target of this EU initiative. Within Team Europe, EIB Global fosters strong, focused partnerships alongside fellow development finance institutions and civil society. EIB Global brings the EIB Group closer to people, companies and institutions through its offices across the world. Photos of EIB headquarters for media use are available here.</p><p>About the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCFP)</p><p>The LCFP is a de-risking platform initiated by the Government of Luxembourg in collaboration with the EIB that seeks to catalyse private sector investments in high-impact climate projects in developing countries.</p><p>About Outrigger Impact</p><p>Outrigger Impact is a specialised blue economy platform, which is developing a dedicated financing facility to build environmental and economic resilience and drive nature-positive outcomes in Small Island Developing States, by catalysing and leveraging the blue economy and enhancing the sustainability of ocean resources. The Outrigger Impact Fund will provide investment capital for blue economy projects in a range of Small Island Developing States, and the Outrigger Technical Assistance Facility will provide grants and concessionary loans to support early-stage projects in islands, with the common aim of delivering dedicated funding of more than $100 million to catalytic projects in island states.</p><p>(European Investment Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G23-G4F3-RV7B-J3FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 16, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DQY8</classCode><className>BLUE ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQZA</classCode><className>BLUE GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N525000CC</classCode><className>FUNDS &amp;

The agreement set out a target to mobilise $200 billion per year globally by 2030, including $20 billion in flows to developing countries by 2025, rising to $30 billion by 2030.</p><p>Private finance will play a crucial role in meeting these ambitious targets and funding the protection and restoration of nature. The event will showcase new and innovative ways to invest in nature, which is crucial to ensuring the health of our oceans and forests for the future. Raising finance for nature recovery will mean that these precious habitats continue to play vital roles in our ecosystems for future generations.</p><p>Environment Secretary Steve Reed, speaking at Lancaster House, said:</p><p>Nature underpins everything. Without it there is no economy, no food, no health and ultimately no society.</p><p>With this Government, Britain stands ready to lead on climate and nature.</p><p>The UK is playing our part to protect nature at home and abroad. We will work with other nations around the world who commit to do the same.</p><p>Ruth Davis, Special Representative for Nature, said:</p><p>Nature is the bedrock of the world's financial systems and economies. It is the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat - but it is in crisis.</p><p>We can no longer rely on public finance alone to tackle the scale of the challenge before us. We must harness the potential of the private sector to drive nature restoration, super-charging opportunities for businesses to see a return on investments in a nature-positive economy - the ambition shown today is a step along that journey.</p><p>Tony Juniper, Chair of Natural England, said:</p><p>We must embrace high ambition in mobilising the finance needed to achieve nature's recovery, ending the short termism which is leading to the destruction of the natural systems on which we depend. The web of life is in decline, and urgent action is needed to halt and reverse the process of running down nature's capital assets.</p><p>Growing nature is an integral part of growing the economy; if we look after nature, it will look after us. Helpful progress has been made today and now we need to harness that for practical action</p><p>This builds upon actions that the Government has already taken to direct private finance towards nature. In March, The British Standards Institution launched the Government-backed Nature Investment Standards, which will help nature-friendly investments across the UK to grow by building confidence among investors. The Government is also gathering views from industry on how to support economic growth while powering nature recovery, with a Call for Evidence currently underway seeking ideas from business and investors - delivering a key recommendation of the Corry Review and the commitments made in the Land Use Framework consultation.</p><p>This came alongside the announcement that the UK will join a new global coalition, the Friends of Cali Fund, which brings together governments and businesses to champion the fair and equitable sharing of benefits they derive from nature.</p><p>Business attendees used the summit to make announcements including:</p><p>Basecamp Research is expanding its biodiscovery network - adding Malawi, Hungary, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography - extending its benefit sharing to 27 countries.</p><p>A future contribution to the Cali Fund by Ginkgo Bioworks, a leading biotech company</p><p>A new collaboration between Conservation International and Silvania to deploy millions of dollars of private capital into nature-based solutions. The collaboration will unlock further funding for the protection and restoration of critical ecosystems</p><p>Financial Sector Deepening Africa, a specialist African development agency, will launch a Nature Finance Innovation Lab with support from the UK Government to address the urgent need to unlock private investment in locally developed nature first projects</p><p>Environment Bank is launching an innovative Nature Shares product in the UK as a voluntary opportunity for business to invest in. These will help restore vital habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, improve water quality, build flood resilience, and enhance community access to nature.</p><p>London Climate Action Week brings together climate expertise and leaders from London and beyond to focus on local, national and international action to restore cut carbon emissions and keep global temperature increases below 1.5c.</p><p>Clean growth presents a huge opportunity for our economy and these measures come as part of a Government effort to make UK the sustainable finance capital of the world as part of our modern Industrial Strategy.</p><p>Growth opportunities will be seen all through London Climate Action Week. The Lancaster House event follows a recent launch of a Call for Evidence on expanding the role of the private sector in nature recovery - delivering a key recommendation of the Corry Review.</p><p>NOTES TO EDITORS</p><p>Tanya Steele, Chief Executive at WWF-UK said:</p><p>Nature underpins our lives - from our food to the economy and even our mental health. Reversing the dramatic consequences of climate change and nature loss demands urgent action to safeguard the world we love. Investing now so people and the natural world don't pay the price later is not just the right thing for the planet - it's smart economics. It creates jobs, builds resilience, and reduces risks for governments, people, and businesses alike. But finance alone isn't enough - without strong policies and regulations, we risk funding solutions with one hand while driving destruction with the other. As critical climate talks in Brazil approach, WWF urges leaders in government to put the policies in place and business to unlock the finance needed to end deforestation and reverse nature loss this decade.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4N-VYK3-RY9N-M1CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 30, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp;

Activities on the ground will be implemented by the University of Greenwich, the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Centre (CATIE), the University of Valle of Guatemala (UVG), and the Federation of Cooperatives of the Verapaces R.L. (FEDECOVERA).</p><p>The project aims to facilitate the integration of traditional and scientific knowledge about nature to plan a more climate-resilient landscape through the implementation of nature-based solutions. It will assess the effectiveness of different reforestation systems and their contribution to climate resilience; support indigenous and local communities to document their understanding of nature's contribution to their livelihoods; and develop guidelines and tools for the co-design of nature-based solutions for climate resilience and justice at a multi-stakeholder level.</p><p>In Alta Verapaz activities will focus on a high rainfall montane region populated by Q'eqchi' communities whose main income sources come from cardamom, coffee and timber production. FEDECOVERA represents some 40,000 Q'eqchi' families supporting their access to Fairtrade, Organic, and Forest Stewardship Council certified markets.</p><p>Interventions in Chiquimula will cover the dry corridor populated with Maya Chorti and ladino communities near the border with Honduras and El Salvador. The project will identify with local communities how to improve environmental resilience to flooding and drought that affects traditional and commercial cropping systems.</p><p>The evidence collected will contribute to building capacity in local and national environmental planning processes, and environmental regulations and incentives adapted to the needs of local communities in Guatemala. Lessons from the application of these processes will be shared to inform climate change planning processes in the country and Central America.</p><p>Juliana Correa, British Ambassador to Guatemala, said:</p><p>A top priority of our Foreign Secretary is to support indigenous peoples' rights and their role in protecting forests. The UK is committed to provide funding for nature, forests, and forest communities, particularly their livelihoods and their rights to protect that nature. I'm looking forward to seeing the wider impact of this project in Guatemala.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F2V-9FD3-RRY0-V2RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004KC5</classCode><className>UNIVERSITY OF GREENWICH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Building on commitments made at COP28 and the One Water Summit, the report sets a baseline for tracking investments and collaboration across the water sector. In 2024 alone, MDBs approved USD 19.6 billion in water-related financing, with 14.4 billion focused on low- and middle-income countries. This first-of-its-kind report reflects the MDBs' shared ambition to improve access to safe water and sanitation, promote sustainable water resource management, and scale up support for climate-resilient irrigation systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report highlights the urgent need for increased investment and reform in the water sector. Despite growing demand and climate pressures, many countries face significant financing gaps-particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and fragile contexts-where spending must increase dramatically to meet Sustainable Development Goals. The MDBs are responding with a mix of sovereign and non-sovereign financing, technical assistance, and innovative instruments to crowd in private capital. They are also supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve service delivery, financial sustainability, and governance in the sector.</p><p>Collaboration is at the heart of this effort. The report showcases joint initiatives across regions-from urban sanitation in Egypt and flood management in the Philippines to climate-resilient infrastructure in Barbados and irrigation in Cambodia. These examples demonstrate how MDBs are working together to align strategies, co-finance projects, and share knowledge. Future editions of the report will track progress, deepen analysis, and spotlight the impact of these investments on people's lives and the planet.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The world's 10 multilateral development banks (MDBs) are committed to joint action to improve global water security by 2030. The Water Security Financing Report 2024 is the first annual report to monitor this joint commitment. The 2024 report provides a baseline for subsequent years as conditions evolve and the global focus on water security for human development, jobs and prosperity increases. This report focuses on water sector financing and actions underway to achieve joint action. Future reports will include the impact and effectiveness of this financing, as well as the necessary policies, institutions, and regulations needed to achieve lasting water security.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>On December 3, 2024, nine multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint commitment to water security at the One Water Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (ADB et al. 2024). This commitment built on a previous statement at COP 28 (ADB et al. 2023).</p><p>COMMITMENT BY THE MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS TO WATER SECURITY</p><p>Joint Statement by the Multilateral Development Banks (African Development Bank Group, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank Group, Islamic Development Bank, New Development Bank, and World Bank Group)</p><p>Water is a key priority of the Multilateral Development Banks; in the last five years we jointly committed USD 50 billion of lending to the water sector, complemented by technical assistance, benefitting more than 400 million people globally.</p><p>At COP28 in December 2023, the Islamic Development Bank delivered a joint statement on behalf of the Multilateral Development Banks committing to increase the number of people benefiting from support for climate-resilient water systems, particularly in water-stressed regions. Building on that commitment and our on-going collaboration, we commit to work together to jointly significantly increase our support to the water sector in the five years between 2025 and 2030, both in terms of financing and technical assistance. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, we aspire to accelerate universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation, scale up irrigation to increase food security and improve livelihoods, enhance flood management, and advance the sustainable management of water resources. We aim to provide hundreds of millions more people with water security through ambitious programs that take advantage of both deeper collaboration between us, and collaboration with other partners.</p><p>Together, we commit to scale up finance for climate-resilient water, using a range of financial instruments. We will explore new and innovative financing that crowds in private and philanthropic resources. We will engage with market-based mechanisms and assist clients to tap relevant climate finance. We will work together to preserve scarce public financing for where it is needed most, prioritizing and leveraging private sector participation and scaling up private-sector financing and to facilitate guarantees and risk-sharing instruments. We will endeavor to ensure no-one is left behind, prioritizing the most vulnerable populations.</p><p>In order to achieve sustainability and greater impact, we believe the water sector needs both technically and financially efficient service providers that can deliver quality services, and sound governance arrangements, including policy, institutional and regulatory regimes, that are implemented with integrity. Accordingly, at the request of our client countries, we will support water sector reforms and investments at country and regional level and will help build utilities that can face the future in a changing climate. We will seek to improve the efficiency and financial sustainability of service providers and affordability for users; to build effective policy, institutional, and regulatory environments; and to enhance governance and transparency in the sector. We will promote nature-based solutions and innovative technical solutions to enhance water security.</p><p>We will work to improve our collaboration and coordination, in line with our different mandates and business models, developing our network, consulting with each other and building our partnership at global, regional and country level. Responding to the needs of our client countries, we will seek out opportunities for co-financing. We will work within the existing coordination processes among MDBs to provide more efficient and coordinated support to our clients. We commit to streamline project execution and implementation and reduce complexity for borrowers. There are many opportunities for us to coordinate the assistance we provide and collaborate to bring clients an optimized package of support. We will seek out ways to scale up our technical assistance and to work together to ensure it is focused on the major obstacles we have jointly identified that impede progress in the water sector. We commit to sharing knowledge and tools.</p><p>We will monitor and report on our success. This will include both progress in reaching our commitments to scale up financing, and realization of our promise to work collaboratively.</p><p>In this statement, the MDBs committed to reporting on joint progress.1 This first annual Water Security Financing Report provides an overview of MDB investments in the water sector around the world, providing a baseline in 2024 against which future financing can be tracked. It highlights the collective effort of the 10 members of the MDB Water Sector Coordination Group-the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), Inter-American Development Bank Group (IDB), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), New Development Bank (NDB), and World Bank Group (WBG)-to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and catalyze innovative solutions. This group defines investments in the water sector as investments in three subsectors: (1) water supply and sanitation, (2) water for agriculture (irrigation), and (3) water resources management (including flood risk management).</p><p>The full report is available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099100406262537840/pdf/IDU-7b7b442f-9ddd-4f59-960f-b4d4b1775123.pdf\">https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099100406262537840/pdf/IDU-7b7b442f-9ddd-4f59-960f-b4d4b1775123.pdf</url></p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5J-5353-S2FH-V3K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 2, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0003YAT</classCode><className>INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002NG2</classCode><className>EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0007LOR</classCode><className>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS921130 PUBLIC FINANCE ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

After 2023's record summer heat, flooding and heatwaves, the need to invest in resilience has never been clearer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) has taken stock of adaption across Europe's urban centres, looking at what actions cities are taking and what is already working.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It finds that almost all European cities are using nature-based solutions as their tool of choice to improve resilience. Of the 19,000 climate action plans surveyed, 91 per cent included options like maintaining parks, urban forests or green roofs and facilitating natural water retention.</p><p>Not only are they effective for cooling and water retention, the report says, they also provide other benefits like more recreational spaces or a reduction in pollution.</p><p>Despite the uptake in nature-based solutions, however, the EEA says the magnitude of expected climate impacts means it may still be necessary to combine them with other types of actions, including physical infrastructure. And concrete targets are desperately needed to make sure Europe's urban centres stay on track.</p><p>Which European cities are adapting well?</p><p>Capital and larger cities are usually frontrunners as they have great financial and technical capacities to work on adaptation, and may even be more ambitious than the national level on climate action, says Ine Vandecasteele, an expert on urban adaptation at the EEA.</p><p>However, it is not only larger cities that are taking good initiatives.</p><p>She points to a few that stick out for their efforts. Ghent in Belgium, for example, has an ambitious greening strategy and is already limiting the construction of new buildings. Even if they are approved there is a 'net-zero' requirement that means an equal area of the city needs to be unpaved or converted back to green space.</p><p>Nantes in France is investing in becoming one of Europe's greenest cities while still trying to remain affordable for residents. Rethymno, a coastal town in Greece, is investing in bioclimatic design in its public spaces, using compressed soil, permeable pavers and paint to effectively reduce maximum air temperature during heatwaves.</p><p>On the flipside, smaller municipalities may need additional support from the regional and national level to be able to develop and implement effective adaptation strategies. In a good example of how to overcome these limitations from Piedmont, Italy, smaller municipalities are banding together to apply for funding.</p><p>Though adaption needs to be tailored to the specific impacts felt in each city, Vandecasteele says similar places can learn a lot from each other.</p><p>For example in tackling increasing heatwaves in southern European cities, or greater variability in rainfall and storms in western and northern Europe. There is a strong need for networking and peer-learning - best practices can and need to be shared.</p><p>Adaptation, she says, also needs the support of citizens who should be involved in every step of the process.</p><p>Why do Europe's cities need to adapt?</p><p>The EEA published the first-ever European climate risk assessment in March this year. It shows that current policies and adaptation actions aren't keeping pace with rapidly growing climate risks - and urban areas are at particular risk from heatwaves and heavy rain.</p><p>Europe is the fastest warming continent with temperatures rising at roughly twice the rate of the global average. Almost three-quarters of the continent's population is estimated to live in urban areas and cities can often be up to 10 to 15C hotter than the surrounding land.</p><p>With more to lose from the consequences of the world's changing climate and a large section of the population to protect, the report highlights the urgent need to adapt European cities to climate change.</p><p>Cities need specific targets for climate adaptation</p><p>If actions taken at a local level are to be properly upscaled then tangible goals and specific targets are needed to measure progress, the report adds. Right now, there are none at national or European levels.</p><p>Targets set by cities could be quite specific, for example ensuring that as much as possible of the population is covered by specific insurance where needed, that housing meets certain minimum energy efficiency standards, that rainwater is separated from greywater collection for all individual houses, or that all citizens have publicly accessible green spaces within a short walk of where they are living, Vandecasteele explains.</p><p>These are needed. But so is a better definition of what the overall goal is, further than 'enhancing resilience', so that actions can be upscaled and mainstreamed towards a more specific common goal.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXN-K9H1-DXMS-80TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 2, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

The CFS has identified key steps to ensure a steady stream of resources toward the pursuit of a climate-resilient Philippines. This includes accelerating the Implementation of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Nationally Determined Contribution Implementation Plan (NDCIP), and Sustainable Finance Roadmap (SFR); strengthening stakeholder capacity for Climate Finance Stewardship; unlocking finance from International Mechanisms;</p><p>maximizing Domestic Budget Allocations for Climate Action; advancing Climate Outcomes vis-a-vis Public-Private Partnerships; and increasing Transparency and Accountability in Climate Action.</p><p>The initiatives on the CFS are funded by the projects of the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office through the Climate Finance Network, as well as the Government of Canada through its Accelerating Green and Climate Finance for the Philippines Project.</p><p>Furthermore, the ITSF is prioritizing the crafting of a policy and legal framework for Carbon Markets on Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) and Article 6 Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOS), and the potential for financing Green Projects under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Code.</p><p>The DOF also continues to coordinate with the World Bank (WB) for its support for the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Carbon Pricing Instruments (CPIs). In designing our carbon policy, the TWG carefully considers its potential socio-economic impacts to ensure that the policy will be non-inflationary, conducive for investment, and well-suited for the country.</p><p>It is our priority to work in close coordination with other key government agencies to prepare the necessary institutional arrangements, infrastructure, registry, and robust monitoring, reporting, and verification measures to send clear policy signals to the domestic and international market that we produce high-integrity carbon credits, DOF Undersecretary Maria Luwalhati Dorotan-Tiuseco said.</p><p>To boost public sector investment in green infrastructure, the government is also updating its Sustainable Finance Framework to enhance the scope of eligible expenditures to be financed by the proceeds of the bonds, incorporate updated sustainability principles, and include more innovative sustainable finance structures. As of 2025, the Philippines has issued a total of USD 7.5 billion in sustainable global bonds. The proceeds from the bond issuances have been used to support the country's green agenda across clean transportation, climate change adaptation, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy, among others.</p><p>On top of this, the country is also equipped with a reliable funding mechanism that is designed to help local government units (LGUs) implement climate change adaptation projects.</p><p>The People's Survival Fund (PSF) Board has already fully committed the fund for 13 projects and 6 Project Development Grants for locally-led climate adaptation projects in 2024.</p><p>Serving as the Designated Alternate Chair of the Board, DOF Undersecretary Dorotan Tiuseco also announced the recent and first ever replenishment of the PSF amounting to PHP 1 billion under the General Appropriations Act FY 2025. This funding will be used to implement NAP-aligned projects of local government units.</p><p>As a testament to its leadership in climate action, the Philippines also holds board memberships in several international climate funds through the DOF.</p><p>Undersecretary Tiuseco, who also sits as a board member of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Adaptation Fund (AF), shared that the DOF has been leveraging more financing from the operating entities of the Financial Mechanisms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and UN Convention on Biological Diversity.</p><p>Last January 2025, the Philippines was renewed for another term in the GCF Board as an Alternate Board Member under the Asia Pacific Group Constituency and was also appointed as a member of the AF Board for 2025 to 2027.</p><p>The AF provides financing to projects and programs that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change.</p><p>The DOF is currently advancing its application to be a national implementing entity of the AF to allow it to receive direct financial transfers to implement adaptation projects and programs.</p><p>The DOF also serves as co-chair of the Board for Accelerating Green and Climate Finance in the Philippines: Nature-Based Solutions (AGCF).</p><p>With an approved funding of USD 4.5 million, the AGCF is a project funded by the Government of Canada that aims to contribute to strengthening the Philippines' resiliency against natural hazards by advancing gender-responsive policies and Nature-based Solutions from March 2022 to December 2026.</p><p>Some of the projects under the AGCF include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Small and Medium Industries and Large Enterprises Embracing Sustainability (SMILEES) Roadshow.</p><p>The project has capacitated both SMEs and Publicly Listed Companies in embedding sustainability within their business operations and developing tools for enhanced reporting. This initiative helps usher businesses towards green capital markets and tap the vast opportunities that sustainable finance can offer.</p><p>The AGCF has also contributed to the development of a one-stop shop for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) implementation in the Philippines through the National Economic and Development Authority's (NEDA) Stakeholder Partnership Accelerator for Convergence and Engagement (SPACE) web application. This helps the public and private sectors identify and develop bankable projects.</p><p>(Department of Finance, Philippines)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJW-B2X3-RSRF-D489-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 15, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DONF</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001959</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

But what we know less clearly is how they can be delivered at scale. Our hope is that today's event will inspire minds to think in this direction, and continue to strengthen the case for these multitasking solutions.</p><p>I am going to kick things off with some of the main ideas that the EU is bringing to the table. Three big ones come to mind.</p><p>First of all, making the most of existing structures. Let's make absolutely sure that nature-based solutions are properly identified in both Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, and in revised National Biodiversity Strategies, Action Plans and national biodiversity targets under the Global Biodiversity Framework.</p><p>This will take some coordination and cooperation. Not just between climate and environment ministries, but with ministries of finance and others too. We need to see a whole-of-government approach.</p><p>Secondly, we need to build up knowledge at all levels.</p><p>I am very proud of how we are doing this in Europe. The Commission, in its Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe research programmes, is funding at least 74 projects on nature-based solutions, with a total contribution of EUR 654 million.</p><p>These projects have 1379 different partner organisations in 70 different countries, and there is a high involvement of cities and municipalities. For a number of these projects, close work is ensured with a wide variety of stakeholders, in the fields of agriculture, finance and insurance, navigation, or water management.</p><p>There is a wealth of work produced under these projects, and that work is accessible to all.</p><p>That includes:</p><p>- a European Roadmap to 2030 for Research &amp; Innovation,</p><p>- a Methodology and practical guidance to assess the impact of these solutions, and</p><p>- a Urban Governance Atlas, which contains details on some 250 good practice policy instruments.</p><p>We also offer practical guidance for businesses through regional and national Nature-Based Solutions hubs that serve local needs and address local specificities.</p><p>There is also a growing European community of practitioners, who keep in touch through an active knowledge broker called NetworkNature.</p><p>The third main strand of our efforts to increase the uptake of nature-based solutions is the policy route that governments can take. In the EU we are doing this with a coming law on Nature Restoration.</p><p>The aim here is to begin repairing the damage that's been done to ecosystems across the whole continent. It should set binding targets to restore 20% of EU lands and sea by 2030, and all areas in need of restoration by 2050.</p><p>It will play an essential role in helping the EU meet its international obligations under the Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as under the Paris Agreement and the Desertification Convention.</p><p>I said three main options, but allow me to add one more.</p><p>And that is, integrating nature-based solutions to our financing and to our financing instruments. Ahead of CBD COP15, the Commission committed to doubling our international biodiversity financing, in particular for the most vulnerable countries. We are in full implementation.</p><p>But we cannot do this alone. It is essential to work with the private sector, with philanthropists and with international financial institutions. My special thanks to the European Investment Bank in this regard, with whom we co-organise this event. I'm sure the panels will provide much greater insights into this.</p><p>Thank you again for coming, and I look forward to hearing your ideas!</p><p>(European Union News)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69VD-6S11-DXMS-8393-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 12, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

For Baudelaire, they were two forces drawn together by awe, fascination, and even conflict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, that dynamic has taken on a new and troubling dimension. We rely on the ocean for climate stability and economic prosperity, yet we are fuelling a climate crisis that threatens to undermine the very system we depend on. We cannot let that happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baudelaire described the sea as a mirror to the human soul. We now need to take a hard look in that mirror and ask ourselves: what can we do to stem the tide of this crisis, to safeguard our ocean and economy?</p><p>This morning's two panel discussions will go a long way towards answering that question. But I would like to take this opportunity to open the plenary session with a few thoughts - about what is at stake, and what stakeholders can do about it.</p><p>The ocean's importance for our climate and economy</p><p>The ocean is home to 95% of the planet's biosphere. It spans environments as varied as sunlit coral reefs and pitch-black abyssal plains. And it supports an immense range of life, from countless microscopic organisms to the world's largest animal, the blue whale.</p><p>Given the ocean's richness, it is worth preserving in its own right. But its value does not end there - the ocean also benefits humanity in two vital ways.</p><p>First, it is one of the planet's most powerful allies in the fight against climate change.</p><p>The ocean helps to regulate global temperatures by absorbing vast amounts of heat and redistributing it through major currents like the Gulf Stream. It is also the world's largest carbon sink, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and helping to slow global warming.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that the ocean has absorbed over 90% of the excess heat trapped in the earth's system, as well as a third of the carbon dioxide that humans have emitted since the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Second, a sustainable ocean serves as an important pillar supporting the global economy, providing for food security and economic opportunities.</p><p>Marine ecosystems support over three billion people who rely on fish for at least 20% of their animal protein intake. Indeed, this dependency is more pronounced in some of the least-developed countries, where seafood provides most of the animal protein consumed.</p><p>These ecosystems also help sustain employment opportunities. More than 150 million jobs depend on the production, trade and consumption of ocean-based goods and services, according to the United Nations. The ocean is also home to key natural resources, such as medicines and biofuels, which are vital for ongoing advances in healthcare and clean energy sectors.</p><p>So, there is a great deal at stake in preserving the ocean's health.</p><p>The threat of climate change</p><p>But today we are placing the sustainability of our ocean under extraordinary stress, with serious implications for both our climate and economy.</p><p>Without the ocean's capacity to absorb heat and carbon, we would have had to contend with a faster, even more dangerous pace of global warming. Yet there are now signs that this capacity is becoming strained.</p><p>The last ten years were the ocean's warmest on record. Warmer oceans are driving more frequent marine heatwaves, which damage ecosystems, and have been a major contributor to rising sea levels due to the thermal expansion of seawater. The rate at which the global mean sea level is rising has more than doubled over the past three decades.</p><p>On top of this, the ocean's absorption of carbon dioxide is driving acidification.</p><p>Combined with ocean warming, acidification is contributing to the bleaching and death of coral reefs, which are vital for supporting fisheries and protecting coastlines from storms. Since 2023 over 80% of the world's coral reefs have been affected by bleaching.</p><p>We find ourselves in dangerous waters. Together, these changes could have profound consequences for the global economy.</p><p>Food security may be undermined, potentially leading to more volatile prices, which is a concern for central banks tasked with safeguarding price stability. And if coastal areas become unliveable due to rising sea levels or frequent flooding, people may be forced to move. More than 600 million people around the world live in coastal areas that are less than ten metres above sea level.</p><p>Stemming the tide</p><p>So, what can we do to stem the tide of these troubling developments? We may not be able to fully reverse the damage done, but we can work towards slowing its momentum, potentially even stopping it, by acting on two important fronts.</p><p>First, we need to protect. That means cutting greenhouse gas emissions decisively and keeping the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p><p>If we succeed in doing so, we could limit sea level rise to around half a metre by the end of the century. That might not sound reassuring. But every tenth of a degree we avoid is a piece of coastline preserved, a reef protected or a storm surge weakened.</p><p>We also need to protect the natural systems that shield us from floods. Nature-based solutions - for instance, restoring mangroves, marshes and coral reefs - offer powerful, cost-effective defences against extreme weather. Coral reefs alone can reduce wave energy by an average of 97% while supporting fisheries, tourism and coastal livelihoods.</p><p>The second front is just as important: we need to prepare.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, climate-related risks are materialising. We need to adapt our infrastructure and economies to a more volatile world. That includes building sea walls and surge barriers and budgeting for resilience rather than reacting after disaster strikes.</p><p>Make no mistake: adaptation will be costly. According to UN assessments, costs could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars globally each year by mid-century. But the cost of inaction would be far higher. One study estimates that failing to keep global temperatures below two degrees above pre-industrial levels could lead to USD 14 trillion in global annual flood costs by 2100.</p><p>To meet this challenge, we need to catalyse finance for marine and coastal conservation - for instance, through innovative approaches that convert natural capital into financial capital.</p><p>This can be especially impactful for vulnerable countries with limited fiscal space. Above all, we must listen to the communities affected, treating their needs as a basis for our actions rather than an afterthought.</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Baudelaire reminds us that the sea is a mirror of our own nature, which can either heal or harm.</p><p>So, let us choose to heal. That means nurturing the ocean's rich diversity and facilitating finance to support innovative adaptation measures that build more resilient communities and a stronger global economy.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(European Central Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2B-1G23-RXCP-R03D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 17, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY8</classCode><className>BLUE ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRES</classCode><className>OCEAN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQZA</classCode><className>BLUE GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001235</classCode><className>OCEANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000383</classCode><className>CONSUMPTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Through these efforts, about 45 million hectares of landscapes and seascapes have been brought under enhanced conservation or management through projects active in the WBG's portfolio in 2024. The World Bank portfolio in 2024 included $4 billion of direct investments in biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p><p>Testimonials</p><p>Read testimonials for Uruguay Green and Resilient Growth Development Policy Loan and Wildlife Conservation Bond Operation projects below.</p><p>The approval of this project [Uruguay Green and Resilient Growth Development Policy Loan] is a first step toward a global paradigm shift and confirms that the World Bank is moving toward the incentive of good practices. The approval of this credit instrument is another innovative step for the country in its search for better conditions of access to international financing. It is equally important that it seeks to enhance Uruguay's positioning in agricultural export markets, which increasingly value sustainable production. The indicators included in this loan, and in the Environmental Bond issued in 2022, demonstrate Uruguay's determination and motivation to follow a development path that combines increased growth and productivity in the livestock sector -- an integral part of the country's economic structure -- with a commitment to non-deforestation of the native forest.</p><p>Azucena Arbeleche</p><p>Minister of Economy and Finance, Uruguay</p><p>The WCB [Wildlife Conservation Bond] model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.</p><p>Oliver Withers</p><p>Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability, Credit Suisse</p><p>Challenge</p><p>Nature underpins economies in tangible, measurable ways, and its rapid loss carries huge costs for governments, economies, and communities. Biodiversity loss is now ranked among the top three most severe risks by the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report, and is projected to cost the poorest countries 10 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) annually by 2030. These trends are further exacerbated by the changing climate, which can trigger feedback effects and tipping points, which, if exceeded, can lead to significant and irreversible changes. Implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework requires $700 billion annually, while current spending falls short, reaching $120-140 billion, much of it in the form of domestic public spending. The private sector will need to play a critical role in closing this large funding gap.</p><p>Approach</p><p>The World Bank Group takes a multi-pronged approach to generate knowledge, create tools, scale up investment, and mobilize private sector finance to help countries manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner. These aspects are interconnected: knowledge and tools drive innovation and investment, which in turn can help attract private capital and generate know-how and tools. This creates a virtuous cycle that can lead to sustainable economic and social development.</p><p>In the domain of analytical support, the World Bank provides knowledge, decision-support tools, and analytics to inform policy dialogues and investments. For example, the Changing Wealth of Nations (CWON) program provides the most comprehensive wealth database available. This database incorporates assets such as human capital and natural capital, covering 151 countries and providing insights on the sustainability of economic progress, allowing it to complement Global Domestic Product (GDP) as an economic measure. With the World Bank's support, the Central Bank in Malaysia is conducting the first nature-related financial risk assessment, deepening the understanding of the interactions between nature and financial institutions. The Geospatial Platforms and Sovereign ESG Data Portal make more data and analytics accessible to client countries and financial institutions and help improve the market recognition of nature-related financial risks.</p><p>In the realm of investing in and mobilizing finance for nature, the WBG is one of the leading financiers of nature globally. In FY24, the World Bank's active portfolio included $4 billion of direct investments in biodiversity and ecosystem services. This portfolio integrates nature considerations into economic policy, development programs, and strategic sectoral investments in nearly 60 countries, supporting the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. To mobilize finance, particularly private capital, the WBG utilizes tailored financial instruments, such as thematic bonds, outcome bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and political/credit risk guarantees to unlock financing by tapping into capital markets, harnessing result-based financing tools, and de-risking private capital investments.</p><p>Results</p><p>As a leading multilateral financier of nature, the World Bank offers a range of knowledge products, direct financing, and tailored financial instruments to scale up public and private investment in nature. This combination of approaches used in the WBG active portfolio in 2024 has contributed to bringing about 45 million hectares of landscapes and seascapes under enhanced conservation and management.</p><p>- Foundational knowledge and analytics, such as the Changing Wealth of Nations and the Economic Case for Nature, support the economic rationale for investment in nature, integrating it into economic and financial decision-making. The global integrated Earth-economy model presented in the Economic Case for Nature report has influenced the incorporation of natural capital data and analytics into the World Bank's country-specific macroeconomic models that inform Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs), and country dialogues and operations in countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, India, Rwanda, Uganda, Brazil, and Malawi.</p><p>- Through the Global Program on Sustainability, the World Bank has helped 30 countries develop and apply natural capital accounts to date. In FY24, four countries (Ghana, Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh) used nature analytics to inform projects worth around $50 million, including landscape restoration efforts in Ghana and sustainable fisheries management in the Maldives. For example, in Ghana, analysis to map out ecosystems and produce datasets for natural services accounts has informed a landscape restoration project and is informing national policy documents. In the Maldives, the analysis of fisheries has helped support sustainable fishery management project. Assessments and recommendations for the sustainable use of fisheries resources have guided the implementation of the Transforming Fisheries Sector Management in South-West Indian Ocean Region and Maldives project.</p><p>- About $600 million of private capital is expected to be mobilized through the World Bank environment-related operations approved in FY22-24, including through the deployment of innovative financial instruments. For example, the World Bank supported Seychelles in issuing the world's first sovereign blue bond using guarantee and concessional funds. World Bank's technical assistance also facilitated the issuance of the first emerging market sovereign green bond in Fiji and the world's first green sukuk in Malaysia. In 2022, the World Bank launched a first-of-its-kind outcome-based bond (outcome bond) to support financing of black rhino conservation activities in South Africa. As of December 2024, after just two and a half years of implementation, the Rhino bond has achieved a rhino population growth rate of 8%, double its target of 4%, while improving the land management of over 154,000 hectares.</p><p>- Another example is the $350 million Uruguay Green and Resilient Growth Performance-Linked Development Policy Loan, the first-ever performance-linked loan by the World Bank with the loan pricing directly linked to reductions in methane emissions intensity. Under the loan term, Uruguay has committed to reducing methane emissions by at least 33 percent between 2025 and 2029 and by at least 36 percent between 2030 and 2034.</p><p>Collaborating across the World Bank Group</p><p>Working collaboratively, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) developed the Nature Finance Tracking Methodology to systematically track and promote contributions to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The Global Challenge Program on Forests for Climate, Development, and Biodiversity is being undertaken by the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA jointly to develop both public and private sector solutions in financing global forest-related investments by mobilizing financing at scale to meet future investment needs.</p><p>Partners</p><p>The WBG is strengthening its partnerships with technology organizations such as NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Group on Earth Observations, to integrate modern digital technologies, including artificial intelligence to better measure the nature impact of our work. Collaboration with the bond investors and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) enabled the Rhino Bond in South Africa; The bond investors' forgone coupon payment was provided to the project as upfront capital investment and the GEF funded a potential performance-based payment.</p><p>The WBG is also increasing its collaboration with other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) on a range of subjects, from climate finance reporting to nature finance tracking, and, recently, to promoting circular economy approaches. Moreover, the WBG and the Inter-American Development Bank launched a groundbreaking partnership in August 2023, combining the WBG's global knowledge and experience with the IDB's strong engagements with Latin American and Caribbean counties to boost support for net-zero-deforestation efforts in the Amazon, strengthen the Caribbean's resilience to natural disasters, and bridge the digital-access gap across the region.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>The World Bank Group will continue scaling up nature analytics and nature finance work for a clean, green, and blue planet. The Global Challenge Program on Forests for Development, Climate, and Biodiversity will enhance support for sustainable forest economies, focusing on critical ecosystems like the Amazon, Congo, and Asian forests. Emphasis will be placed on improving data quality and access through technologies and open data initiatives, such as the Livable Planet Observatory. Greater outreach activities are planned, including through hackathons, and the Landscape Knowledge Academy. Collaboration with multilateral development banks, the OECD, and other partners will boost financing for the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5Y-H463-RS22-K0RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 4, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523940 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

From coast to coast to coast, water is fundamental to our economy, communities, and environment. It is also an integral part of Canada's identity.</p><p>Yet fresh water in Canada is under increasing pressure from climate change, pollution, and other threats.</p><p>Canadians expect strong leadership to protect fresh water - and we are delivering. Last year, we created the Canada Water Agency to protect this vital resource and ensure safe, clean, and well-managed water for future generations. Canada is making historic investments and building partnerships with provinces and territories, Indigenous partners, academia, and industry to strengthen freshwater management, protection, and stewardship.</p><p>Canadians expect strong leadership on water, and we are delivering. From safeguarding critical freshwater ecosystems like the Great Lakes and Lake Winnipeg to implementing nature-based solutions that protect our water sources, we are working to build a more secure water future.</p><p>The theme for this year's World Water Day-Glacier Preservation-highlights an urgent challenge: the rapid loss of glaciers due to climate change. In Canada, glaciers feed major rivers, regulate water supplies, and support biodiversity. The alarming decrease of glaciers is already impacting affecting drinking water supplies, agriculture, hydropower, and Indigenous ways of life. While we work to protect freshwater, we must also acknowledge the growing impacts of glacier loss.</p><p>On this World Water Day, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on the importance of preserving our water and take steps-big or small-to reduce their water consumption. Our natural resources make Canada strong. Standing up for our water is standing up for Canada, and by protecting it, we protect our future.</p><p>Source: Government of Canada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDF-05T3-RVKS-V081-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 25, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

The total permitted extraction over the 15-year term of the licence is 15 million tonnes.</p><p>The extraction of aggregates uses trailer suction hopper dredgers and cargo screening will be employed.</p><p>Marine aggregates are crucial to the construction industry as they are used for building houses and transport infrastructure and are also important to the marine environment through replenishing beaches and improving coastal defences.</p><p>Marine aggregate extraction has wider environmental benefits as it reduces both quarrying on land and lorry deliveries over large distances. Due to cargo screening, it is also possible to extract different sediments based on customer demand.</p><p>New footbridge at Stiffkey Saltmarsh</p><p>The National Trust applied for a marine licence to construct a replacement footbridge over Cabbage Creek at Stiffkey Saltmarsh on the Norfolk Coast Path.</p><p>There has been a crossing at the location since the late 19th century. The new footbridge will replace the former bridge that had fallen into disrepair and had to be removed in 2022.</p><p>Stiffkey Saltmarsh is a valuable habitat and has several protected site designations as well as being an area of outstanding natural beauty. The new footbridge is designed to be unobtrusive to the surrounding environment while also providing safe access for everyone to enjoy the saltmarsh. The crossing will also remove the risk of visitors becoming cut off by high tides and requiring evacuation.</p><p>The marine licensing team worked with the applicant to ensure appropriate measures were in place to protect the natural environment, while also enabling the project to begin before winter restrictions pushed the project back by a year.</p><p>Stronger Shores - Scientific Sensor Array</p><p>Durham Wildlife Trust were granted a marine licence as part of their Stronger Shores project.

The units can be fitted with either seeded rope or unseeded rope for aquaculture growth. The data gathered over the 23 month length of the project should provide information on the effects of seaweed in contributing to climate resilience through nature-based-solutions.</p><p>The marine licensing team supported the applicant through the application process through positive and proactive communication which enabled the application to be processed within the 90-day KPI.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJP-0993-RT7J-62YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 14, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001030</classCode><className>LICENSES &amp;

The River Yare is one of only 210 chalk streams worldwide: making it an incredibly rare and precious habitat.</p><p>Most chalk streams are in southern England-including 58 in East Anglia alone.</p><p>The Environment Agency provided a third of the funding, with additional funding support from the Norfolk Water Strategy Programme (NWSP) along with in-kind donations.</p><p>NWSP is hosted by Water Resources East in partnership with Norfolk County Council, Anglian Water and The Nature Conservancy with support from WWF and Finish partnership.</p><p>The project involved creating a 651-metre meandering river channel and reconnecting the River Yare to its lowland floodplain meadow.</p><p>This reconnection will restore natural processes, enhance river habitats; resilience by slowing water flow, and promote sediment deposition on the floodplain during floods; improving water quality.</p><p>Furthermore, a mosaic of new wetland habitats, including 6 scrapes and 2 ponds covering an area of 10,696 m2, has been created.</p><p>Boost for habitat quality</p><p>These features will enhance water storage during high flows, thus providing natural flood management and increased groundwater infiltration.</p><p>These changes to the river flows will boost habitat quality and complexity, benefitting species like water voles, insects, breeding wader birds, reptiles and marginal plants.</p><p>Amy Prendergast, Catchment Delivery Manager for the Environment Agency, said:</p><p>Restoring biodiversity in partnership projects like this is incredibly important to protecting the South Norfolk landscape.</p><p>The team worked hard to bring this high-quality design, which was bespoke to the site, to life with climate change adaptations in mind. We look forward to working closely with partners again in future.</p><p>Donna Dean, NRT's River Restoration Team Leader, said:</p><p>We faced several challenges completing this project, including two very wet periods. Despite this, it's been incredibly rewarding to see the wetlands come to life as they fill with water.</p><p>Restoring meandering rivers and re-wetting landscapes is a major win for both wildlife and river health. After the recent rainfall, the floodplain is functioning naturally, storing water and reducing peak flows downstream.</p><p>Already, the site is being visited by a variety of bird species, including snipe, little egrets, oyster catchers and sandpipers.</p><p>Hannah Gray, Water Resources East's (WRE) Programme Manager for Nature-Based Solutions, said:</p><p>WRE were thrilled to bring additional funding partners together to deliver water security and biodiversity improvements in the Yare catchment.</p><p>As one of the first pilot projects in our Norfolk Water Strategy Programme, the River Yare restoration scheme has provided valuable insights for our growing portfolio of nature-based solutions investments.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1R-P9G3-RRNW-B461-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 3, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp;

Sustainable pesticide use supports healthier ecosystems where vital pollinators, such as bees, are allowed to flourish - boosting crop health and food production for the long-term.</p><p>This comes as part of the UK Government's wider Plan for Change, which is clear food security is national security and is why we are supporting farmers to spend less on pesticides in the future while boosting productivity.</p><p>Environment Minister Emma Hardy said:</p><p>The Government is restoring our natural world as part of our commitment to protect the environment while supporting productivity and economic growth.</p><p>That is why we have banned bee killing pesticides in England and today we're going further to support farmers and growers to adopt sustainable practices.</p><p>Wales' Deputy First Minister with responsibility for Climate Change and Rural Affairs, Huw Irranca-Davies, said:</p><p>We are determined to protect nature by reducing the risks from pesticides. This new plan encourages changes across all sectors of society so that we can achieve this, together.</p><p>In Wales, we'll also take direct action through our Sustainable Farming Scheme and by working with parks, gardens and home gardeners to help us stop and reverse nature loss.</p><p>Scottish Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie said:</p><p>Our goal is to minimise the risks and impact of pesticides to human health and the environment, while ensuring that our land managers have effective tools to manage pests and pesticide resistance. This includes targeting use of conventional chemical pesticides to when environmentally and economically justified, ensuring users have the knowledge and support needed to adopt a range of sustainable crop protection practices, and improving and supporting compliance with regulations to ensure pesticides are used safely.</p><p>Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister for Northern Ireland, Andrew Muir said:</p><p>I welcome the role that my department has played in the development of the new UK NAP alongside Defra, the Scottish Government and Welsh Government. My Department will continue to work closely with colleagues across government, as we collectively work towards meeting our domestic reduction target for pesticides in the UK.</p><p>This NAP will support voluntary moves by farmers towards more sustainable pest management, which can benefit farm businesses, as well as the environment. By using nature-based solutions and alternative techniques, farmers can better safeguard crops for the long-term, helping to cut down expenditure on pesticides, and contributing towards greater productivity.</p><p>The core goals of the National Action Plan are to:</p><p>Set clear targets and measures to monitor the use of pesticides</p><p>The NAP introduces a UK-wide domestic reduction target for pesticides, focused on achieving a 10% reduction in potential environmental harm by 2030 rather than a simple volume reduction target. Progress towards this target will be monitored using a Pesticide Load Indicator which measures the impacts of pesticides across 20 indicators.</p><p>Encourage uptake of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</p><p>IPM involves using a range of techniques or methods to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, while managing pests effectively. This could mean using nature-based solutions to create habitats for natural predators of pests and rotating crops to break pest, weed and disease cycle, or using innovative techniques - like using biopesticides or new precision application technologies.</p><p>Strengthen compliance and promote good practice</p><p>The NAP also outlines how we will ensure regulations are followed by targeting enforcement efforts where they are needed most, through training, guidance and enhanced inspections and enforcement.</p><p>The UK is a world leader in agri-food Research &amp; Development. The actions in the NAP will build on this strong foundation and support continued growth in the sector, including by supporting manufacturers to bring more biopesticides to market and reducing barriers to innovation and precision application technology, such as drones.</p><p>Through the Farming Innovation Programme, Defra has already committed \\xA3150 million for industry-led research and development in agriculture and horticulture, demonstrating the Government's commitment to drive innovation that will transform the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of farming.</p><p>The publication of the NAP follows wider Government action on pesticides. Ministers have committed to taking decisive action to protect bees and other pollinators by ending the use of three bee killing neonicotinoids - clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam - in England. The launch of the NAP presents another step in protecting our pollinators and promoting food security for the future.</p><p>The NAP builds upon existing resources designed to support farmers in implementing IPM.</p><p>The UK government is funding a wide range of innovative projects into sustainable pest management, including AI-enabled pest management tools.</p><p>We have also published an IPM guidance page which provides clear and practical information about IPM tools to support planning and decision making.</p><p>The NAP has been published by Defra and the devolved governments.

A major project in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, focusing on the prevention of pollution in the Ramganga River, received the green light. The 409.93 crore initiative includes the construction of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) with capacities of 15 MLD and 65 MLD in Zone-3 and Zone-4 respectively. Additionally, five major drains in the region will be intercepted and diverted to minimize direct sewage discharge into the river.</p><p>In Bihar, a project in Arrah town was approved at an estimated cost of 328.29 crore. This includes the construction of a 47 MLD capacity STP and a 19.5 km sewer network. Implemented under the Hybrid Annuity Model, the project also covers the plant's operation and maintenance for 15 years. The scheme aims to provide a long-term solution to sewage issues in Arrah and reduce untreated wastewater flowing into the Ganga.</p><p>Another major project was approved for Kanpur city in Uttar Pradesh, targeting the interception and diversion of 14 untapped drains. With an estimated cost of 138.11 crore, the initiative is expected to significantly improve the city's drainage and sanitation system by channeling sewage to treatment plants through newly proposed sewage pumping stations and manholes.</p><p>In West Bengal, the Executive Committee approved an Integrated Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant (FSTP) for Pujali Municipality under the Namami Gange programme. With a total cost of 5.96 crore, the project involves setting up an 8 KLD capacity facility aimed at improving urban sanitation and protecting water resources.</p><p>The Committee also cleared a nature-based solution project for the rejuvenation of the Yamuna River in Delhi. The initiative includes the installation of pilot CAMUS-SBT (Continuous Advanced Mite Utilizing System - Soil-Based Treatment) plants in the Shahdara drain to treat liquid pollutants. These 5 MLD capacity plants aim to meet water quality standards set by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).</p><p>Further, the EC approved the establishment of the NMCG-IIT Delhi-Dutch Collaboratory for Intelligent River Systems and Clean Yamuna (IND-RIVERS), under the India-Netherlands Water Strategic Partnership.

David Lammy, UK Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, and the Italian Vice-President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Antonio Tajani, co-chaired a roundtable in Rome today focused on clean power for growth, in the presence of His Majesty The King and the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella.</p><p>Today, in the presence of His Majesty The King and of the President of the Italian Republic, we discussed the efforts of Italy and the UK to drive forward work on clean power for growth. We reiterated the commitments made in the Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Cooperation signed by the UK and Italy in April 2023, and the Joint Statement between Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the President of the Council of Ministers Giorgia Meloni in September 2024. We emphasised the importance for affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, in supporting sustainable inclusive growth and development.</p><p>Energy security, accessibility, sustainability and affordability is important now and for future generations. We must embrace the opportunities we have to diversify energy systems, with all the benefits they bring. We recognise the important progress that Italy led during its G7 Presidency and through its Mattei Plan for Africa, and the UK's new Global Clean Power Alliance. We will continue to promote this approach globally and through the International Energy Agency Summit on the Future of Energy Security in London.</p><p>We underline our commitment, in the context of a global effort, to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest, reaching Paris Agreement goals and COP28 Global Stocktake outcomes. We recognise that in a complex and changing geopolitical context, energy security, affordability and independence have become a priority. In this scenario, we underline that energy security is strongly linked to the energy transition and reiterate the need to take advantage of all decarbonisation solutions and technologies, while recognising different national pathways. We will work together to accelerate all opportunities offered by the transition to clean energy, including stimulating economic growth, unlocking new innovations, maximising clean alternatives and nature-based solutions, and creating new skills and jobs, to establish energy systems that are more resilient. This provides the most effective route to ensuring energy security and energy affordability, whilst also delivering long-term prosperity. We will demonstrate clean power leadership through the G7, G20, UN General Assembly, COP30 and beyond.</p><p>We are committed to working together on the challenges now and in the future around clean energy supply chain resilience and to promoting just, secure, sustainable and inclusive energy transitions. Both the UK and Italy are pushing economic growth opportunities through our vibrant clean energy industrial bases, recognising that new partnerships on clean power supply chains will be essential in supporting this. This is why Italy and the UK will work together on this agenda. We also recognise the need to support Africa's ambitions and efforts to develop adequate clean energy infrastructure and supply chains, in a spirit of equitable and strategic partnerships. We welcome the partnerships forged between UK and Italian energy companies. We are committed to deepening these further.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJP-0993-RT7J-62X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 14, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUMwRjNCRUQ4NUI2NEIwMkI1RTcyRUEzRDgxMEZCMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REJGNjMzRTJDMDRGNDM0Mjg3QjAxNTE2MDU2RjlDMDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Foreign Affairs</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUExRDg4Njk5OUM1NDk3REFCQzg1QkMwMjhERDc4NDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

This collaboration is part of the\u00a0project titled\u00a0'Making NbCS in Aquaculture in Southeast Asia Monitoring More Gender Responsive'\u00a0(GeNA Project), which focuses on enhancing aquaculture practices while ensuring environmental conservation and promoting gender equality. </p><p>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Prof. Pai-Chi Li, President of AIT, and Mrs. Thitiporn Laoprasert, Deputy Director General of the Department of Fisheries. The agreement outlines cooperation in academic, research, and development initiatives aimed at applying nature-based solutions to address the impacts of climate change on aquaculture. </p><p>The GeNA Project is designed to strengthen the aquaculture sector by incorporating inclusive approaches that recognise and empower individuals of all gender identities. It emphasises equality, capacity building, and reducing social and economic disparities. The project also includes knowledge-sharing activities to support agricultural entrepreneurs, with support from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Canada. </p><p>The project is being piloted in three countries: the Philippines, Cambodia, and Thailand. In Thailand, the initiative focuses on rice-fish farming a nature-based method that promotes food security, income generation, and sustainable growth in the fisheries sector. </p><p>Prof. Kyoko Kusakabe, Head of the Gender and Development Studies program at AIT's Department of Development and Sustainability, noted that AIT and the Department of Fisheries have a long-standing collaboration. 'The GeNA Project is about strengthening innovation and knowledge in the fisheries and aquaculture industries while also advancing gender equality. It supports greater involvement of women in aquaculture by enhancing their skills and enabling them to pursue careers, earn income, and contribute to sustainable development,' she said. </p><p>Mrs. Thitiporn Laoprasert added that the Department of Fisheries plays a key role in researching, supporting, and promoting fisheries-related careers across Thailand. She emphasised the importance of modernising the sector through the development of new technologies and innovations to address the ongoing impacts of climate change. </p><p>'These challenges demand swift adaptation across all areas of fisheries and aquaculture. Our collaboration with AIT aims to improve aquaculture production, enhance sustainability, and boost competitiveness in the global market,' she said. 'Through this partnership, knowledge and innovations will be shared with farmers, helping them strengthen their livelihoods, increase incomes, and support the long-term growth of the sector.' </p><p>The GeNA Project also contributes to national efforts to enhance the international competitiveness of Thailand's fisheries industry and prepare for future demands in the global market. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG3103202500010009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FG2-P513-RVJ5-W3DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24135\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 31, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N924120GJ</classCode><className>FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRES</classCode><className>OCEAN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TJ1</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D7R3</classCode><className>GENDER EQUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

These increasingly extreme wildfires are endangering lives, affecting human health, destroying homes and ecosystems, and costing governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We resolve to boost global cooperation to prevent, fight and recover from wildfires by taking integrated action to reduce the incidence and negative impacts of wildfires and ensure our readiness to help each other, and partners, when needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will take steps to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of wildfires by:</p><p>- Adopting a whole of society approach, including different levels of government, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, international and non-governmental organizations, academia, and the private sector, to share knowledge and drive research on reducing risks.</p><p>- Implementing mitigation and adaptation actions, grounded in scientific research and local knowledge, that reduce the risk of extreme wildfires, such as sustainable forest management, nature-based solutions, Indigenous land management practices including cultural or controlled burning, and adopting fire risk reduction measures around communities, buildings, and infrastructure.</p><p>- Raising awareness of the different causes of wildfires and measures to prevent them, including to reduce the number of wildfires started accidentally or maliciously.</p><p>We will strengthen global capacity to prepare for and respond to wildfires when they happen by:</p><p>- Leveraging research, tools and technology that forecast, identify, and monitor wildfires, such as fire danger rating systems, geospatial technologies, and systems to provide early warnings when wildfire moves towards inhabited areas or infrastructure.</p><p>- Collaborating on data collection and information sharing to better understand and respond to wildfires and their impacts, including on different population groups.</p><p>- Building our shared capacity to mitigate and respond to the impacts of wildfire exposure on human health and well-being.</p><p>- Enhancing interoperability, through sharing best practices and where relevant, developing common protocols, capabilities, and procedures related to wildfire response, including on training.</p><p>- Exploring ways to improve timely access to basic firefighting equipment and capabilities that help meet country-specific needs.</p><p>We will rebuild for resilience to recover from wildfires by:</p><p>- Identifying areas for active restoration efforts versus those where natural regeneration works best, taking actions that support biological diversity and restore nature and deploying nature-based solutions to strengthen resilience and reduce risks.</p><p>- Rebuilding with wildfire-resilient infrastructure, including strengthening the wildland-urban interface through resilient urban design, landscape, and infrastructure planning.</p><p>- Encouraging research to better understand local conditions to support and scale-up ecological restoration, finding best methods for sustainable forest management to help prevent and mitigate wildfires, including in rapidly shifting conditions, and using community-based, whole of society approaches that incorporate local and, where opportunities exist, Indigenous practices, and increased participation by women.</p><p>We will seek synergies with work underway at the G20. Interested signatories will also work through forums like the United Nations Global Fire Management Hub. We will align with commitments to halt and reverse deforestation and forest and land degradation by 2030 globally.</p><p>Together, we will achieve a stronger and more coordinated global approach to wildfire resilience.</p><p>We welcome the endorsement of the Kananaskis Wildfire Charter by the Leaders of Australia,</p><p>India, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, and South Africa</p><p>G7 CRITICAL MINERALS ACTION PLAN</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, recognize that critical minerals are the building blocks of digital and energy secure economies of the future. We remain committed to transparency, diversification, security, sustainable mining practices, trustworthiness and reliability as essential principles for resilient critical minerals supply chains, and acknowledge the importance of traceability, trade, and decent work in contributing to our economic prosperity and that of our partners.</p><p>We have shared national and economic security interests, which depend on access to resilient critical minerals supply chains governed by market principles. We recognize that non-market policies and practices in the critical minerals sector threaten our ability to acquire many critical minerals, including the rare earth elements needed for magnets, that are vital for industrial production. Recognizing this threat to our economies, as well as various other risks to the resilience of our critical minerals supply chains, we will work together and with partners beyond the G7 to swiftly protect our economic and national security. This will include anticipating critical minerals shortages, coordinating responses to deliberate market disruption, and diversifying and onshoring, where possible, mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling.</p><p>We are launching a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan, building on the Five-Point Plan for Critical Minerals Security established during Japan's G7 Presidency in 2023 and advanced by Italy in 2024. The Action Plan will focus on diversifying the responsible production and supply of critical minerals, encouraging investments in critical mineral projects and local value creation, and promoting innovation.</p><p>We are committed to action in the following areas:</p><p>Building standards-based markets</p><p>We recognize that critical minerals markets should reflect the real costs of responsible extraction, processing, and trade of critical minerals, while ensuring labour standards, local consultation, anti-bribery and corruption measures and addressing negative externalities, including pollution and land degradation.</p><p>We will develop a roadmap to promote standards-based markets for critical minerals, in collaboration with industry, international organizations, resource producing nations, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, unions, and civil society. The roadmap will establish a set of criteria that constitute a minimum threshold for standards-based markets, strengthening traceability as a necessary measure. As part of these efforts, we will evaluate potential market impacts.</p><p>We task relevant ministers to produce this roadmap, setting out milestones to be met in fulfilling this commitment, before the end of the year.</p><p>Mobilizing capital and investing in partnerships</p><p>We recognize the need to work together to increase investment in responsible critical minerals projects within the G7 and around the world. Immediate and scaled investment is required to secure future supply chains and ensure promising mining and processing projects overcome barriers such as delays in permitting and approvals processes, market manipulation, and price volatility.</p><p>Critical minerals are an opportunity to build mutually beneficial partnerships and drive economic development, innovation and shared prosperity. We will continue to work with emerging market and developing country partners to develop quality infrastructure, such as economic corridors. We will address investment barriers and support policy and regulatory reforms that improve the investment climate of our partners and empower entrepreneurs in low-and middle-income countries, including through the G20 Compact with Africa. Our approach will support local economic growth, build community trust, and reduce investment risks, creating the necessary conditions to attract responsible private capital.</p><p>We will continue to support the development of responsible critical minerals projects through direct partnerships with each other and by promoting private sector investment. We encourage our export credit agencies and development finance institutions (DFIs) to identify more opportunities for collaboration. We also welcome the work of the G7 DFIs to enhance coordination on critical minerals projects as an important step.</p><p>To build on this momentum, we encourage multilateral development banks, as well as private sector lenders, to make further capital available for investment in standards-based critical minerals projects, including through innovative financing. We also encourage them to leverage existing financing mechanisms to de-risk projects, maximize and mobilize private capital, and increase the resilience and security of global critical minerals supply chains.</p><p>We are committed to deepening our cooperation with mineral-rich emerging market and developing country partners. We will help build their capacity; foster local value creation; create opportunities for all; promote responsible mining practices; combat gender-based violence in the mining industry; support the improvement of artisanal mining; and diversify global critical minerals value chains.</p><p>In this spirit, to promote responsible mining-related activities in emerging mining nations, we welcome the G7 Finance Ministers commitment to strengthen the World Bank-led Resilient and Inclusive Supply Chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership. Interested G7 members will also support initiatives such as the Minerals Security Partnership and its MSP Forum, and the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development.</p><p>Recalling our commitment to promote debt sustainability and transparency, we acknowledge the challenges faced by developing countries with mounting debt levels, including to finance infrastructure. We will promote debt sustainability through transparent and fair development finance, and we will support countries facing debt challenges including near-term liquidity challenges. We call on all international providers of finance to do the same. This includes working within the G20 to improve the implementation of the Common Framework.</p><p>Promoting innovation</p><p>We have rich public and private innovation ecosystems with untapped potential to address strategic technology and processing gaps essential to bringing critical minerals to market.</p><p>We will intensify our collaboration to fill targeted innovation gaps in critical minerals research and development, with a focus on processing, licensing, recycling, substitution and redesign, and circular economy. We will work with partner organizations to showcase new technologies and production processes.</p><p>We look forward to the upcoming Conference on Critical Materials and Minerals, to be chaired by the United States in Chicago, in September 2025, in order to advance this work.</p><p>We welcome the endorsement of the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan by the Leaders of Australia,</p><p>India, and the Republic of Korea.</p><p>G7 LEADERS' STATEMENT ON TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, are deeply concerned by growing reports of transnational repression (TNR). TNR is an aggressive form of foreign interference whereby states or their proxies attempt to intimidate, harass, harm or coerce individuals or communities outside their borders.</p><p>TNR undermines national security, state sovereignty, the safety and human rights of victims, and principles of international law. It has a chilling effect in our countries. TNR often impacts dissidents, journalists, human rights defenders, religious minorities, and those identified as part of diaspora communities.</p><p>We condemn all acts of TNR including but not limited to those involving:</p><p>- Threats or acts of physical violence such as harassment, assault, abduction or assassination;</p><p>- Misuse of cooperation with other foreign states, international bodies and intergovernmental organizations, in order to detain, forcibly return, or repress targets, such as leveraging extraterritorial law application and counterterrorism and investigative tools;</p><p>- Forced return by confiscating passports, invalidating documents, or denying consular services;</p><p>- Digital transnational repression, such as doxing and sexualized smear campaigns particularly targeting women, to induce compliance, silence, threaten, discredit, or retaliate;</p><p>- Misuse of spyware and cyber tools to engage in surveillance, and to enable physical targeting and tracking, hacking, or cyber harassment; and</p><p>- Direct or implicit threats against family members.</p><p>We also remain seized of threats by foreign states and their proxies to our citizens outside our borders, such as arbitrary detention.</p><p>We recognize the important role played by all partners, including civil society, academia and the private sector, in countering this threat. We welcome the recommendations for action emanating from the G7 multistakeholder Dialogue on Transnational Repression, hosted in Ottawa in February 2025, to develop concrete strategies for protecting those who are targeted.</p><p>Building on the 2018 Charlevoix commitment on defending democracy from foreign threats, and these recommendations, we, the Leaders of the G7, commit to foster a common understanding of TNR, raise awareness, and promote accountability to increase the costs for those who engage in acts of TNR. As part of these efforts, we intend to:</p><p>- Build global understanding of the threat and its corrosive impact, including on human rights and democracy; this includes reporting on TNR as an important vector of foreign interference in G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) public reports, and strengthening engagement with likeminded partners and engaging more broadly in relevant multilateral fora.</p><p>- Develop a TNR Resilience and Response Framework that includes: measures to boost G7 cooperation to counter TNR; a compendium of operational, diplomatic, policy, legislative, and community engagement best practices; and information sharing around the latest techniques, trends and vectors of TNR observed globally, drawing on wider initiatives such as the Pall Mall process related to cyber intrusion capabilities.</p><p>- Launch a Digital TNR Detection Academy through the G7 RRM to build collective capacity to detect TNR online; the Academy will provide G7 and partners with the technical skills and tools for identifying and responding to the latest technology-enabled threats.</p><p>- Support those who may be targets of TNR as well as members of civil society who are actively working to counter the threat, including through initiatives like the Canada-UK Common Good Cyber Fund, and by acting in solidarity with other states affected by TNR.</p><p>We will redouble our efforts to keep our communities safe, to defend human rights, including the freedom of expression online and offline, and to safeguard our sovereignty.</p><p>G7 LEADERS' STATEMENT ON COUNTERING MIGRANT SMUGGLING</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, reaffirm our commitment to prevent and counter migrant smuggling through the G7 Coalition to Prevent and Counter the Smuggling of Migrants and the 2024 G7 Action Plan to Prevent and Counter the Smuggling of Migrants. We are determined to enhance border management and enforcement and dismantle the transnational organized crime groups profiting from both migrant smuggling and human trafficking.</p><p>Migrant smuggling often has links to other serious criminal offences, including money laundering, corruption and trafficking in persons and drugs, that threaten the safety of our communities. It can expose vulnerable smuggled persons to grave and life-threatening risks, including physical abuse, sexual and gender-based violence, extortion, labour exploitation, and forced labour and criminality.</p><p>Through the G7 Coalition, we have made concrete progress on strengthening the operational and investigative capacities of our law enforcement agencies in the fight against migrant smuggling; and enhancing international cooperation between police, judicial, prosecution and border services.</p><p>We task our Interior and Security Ministers to double down on the following areas of the G7 Action Plan this year:</p><p>- Adopt a follow the money approach, exploring innovative solutions that leverage financial intelligence and information-sharing to identify criminal actors; use administrative or judicial processes to hold these criminal actors accountable, seize their assets and strip them of their profits;</p><p>- Boost prevention with countries of origin and transit through strengthening border management capacities and by raising awareness of the risks;</p><p>- Collaborate with social media companies to agree on voluntary principles to prevent organized crime groups from exploiting online platforms to advertise, coordinate, and facilitate migrant smuggling operations;</p><p>- Engage with transport operators to prevent the facilitation of irregular migration, including the weaponization of migrants to undermine stability or as a hybrid warfare tactic.</p><p>We will explore, consistent with our legal systems, the potential use of sanctions to target criminals involved in migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations from countries where those activities emanate.</p><p>We will continue to leverage synergies with other global and regional initiatives aimed at fostering international cooperation.</p><p>We support the continuation of policies for legal migration that members assess to be in their respective national interests. As we work to prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking, we remain committed to countering all forms of abuse and exploitation of migrants, ensuring protection of the most vulnerable, including refugees and forcibly displaced persons. In so doing, we will meet our respective international human rights commitments.</p><p>G7 LEADERS' STATEMENT ON AI FOR PROSPERITY</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, recognize the potential of a human-centric approach to artificial intelligence (AI) to grow prosperity, benefit societies and address pressing global challenges. To realize this potential, we must better drive innovation and adoption of secure, responsible, and trustworthy AI that benefits people, mitigates negative externalities, and promotes our national security. We will power AI now and into the future. And we will work with emerging market and developing country partners to close digital divides, in line with the United Nations Global Digital Compact.</p><p>We must seize the potential of AI in our public sectors to drive efficiency and better serve our publics. We also recognize that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including microenterprises, are the backbone of our economies, driving growth and creating jobs. In 2024, we committed to work together to help SMEs adopt and develop new technologies, including AI, to accelerate broad-based growth. We also committed to fully leverage the potential of AI to enable decent work while addressing challenges for our labour markets. We reiterate the importance of operationalizing Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) through trustworthy, cross-border data flows, and affirm its value in enabling trusted AI development and use. We recognized the transformative impact of AI for the cultural and creative sectors, including challenges to business models and job security, and opportunities to boost innovation.</p><p>We recognize that increased AI adoption will place growing pressure on our energy grids, produce negative externalities and have implications for energy security, resilience and affordability. At the same time, AI can be harnessed to promote energy innovation and bolster the resilience and reliability of our energy systems.</p><p>We hear the concerns of emerging market and developing country partners about the challenges they face in building resilient AI ecosystems, including the risks of disruption and exclusion from today's technological revolution.</p><p>To fully realize the potential of AI for our publics and our partners, we commit to:</p><p>Work together to accelerate adoption of AI in the public sector to enhance the quality of public services for both citizens and businesses and increase government efficiency while respecting human rights and privacy, as well as promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability.</p><p>- To this end, Canada as G7 presidency is launching the G7 GovAI Grand Challenge and will host a series of Rapid Solution Labs to develop innovative and scalable solutions to the barriers we face in adopting AI in the public sector.</p><p>- We will leverage our existing government AI expertise to establish a G7 AI Network (GAIN) to advance the Grand Challenge; develop a roadmap to scale successful AI projects; and create a catalogue of open-source and shareable AI solutions for members. GAIN will collaborate to ensure that AI solutions in government have measurable and real benefits for our communities.</p><p>- We task relevant Ministers to explore strategic investments for accelerating public sector AI adoption in transformative ways, including for large language models and digital infrastructure.</p><p>Promote economic prosperity by supporting SMEs to adopt and develop AI that respects personal data and intellectual property rights, and strengthen their readiness, efficiency, productivity and competitiveness.</p><p>- We launch the G7 AI Adoption Roadmap, which provides clear, actionable pathways for companies to adopt AI and scale their businesses. Through this Roadmap, we commit to: sustain investments in AI adoption programs for SMEs, including supporting access to compute and digital infrastructure; publish a common blueprint for AI adoption by SMEs underpinned by proven use-cases from G7 economies; deepen our cooperation on talent exchange to integrate AI skills within businesses looking to scale; and develop tools that grow business and consumer confidence and trust in AI adoption including by leveraging the outcomes of the Hiroshima AI Process. We will collaborate with international partners, like the Global Partnership on AI, to advance this work.</p><p>- We will build resilient future workforces by preparing workers for AI-driven transitions. To do so, we will advance implementation of the 2024 G7 Action Plan for a human-centered adoption of safe, secure and trustworthy AI in the world of work, including by developing a voluntary compendium of best practices.</p><p>- We will drive economic growth, address talent shortages, and ensure equal opportunity, by encouraging girls, as well as members of communities left behind by globalization, to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and increasing women's representation in the AI talent pool at all levels.</p><p>Meet the energy challenges of AI and harness its potential for advancements in energy efficiency and innovation.</p><p>- We will cooperate on innovative solutions to address energy challenges across our economies, including for AI and data centres, that support our respective national and international commitments. We will also support innovation that improves the energy and resource efficiency of AI models and optimizes data centre operations. We will advance AI solutions to unlock energy innovation and breakthrough discoveries, including optimization of energy use, and adopt AI to help build secure, resilient, and affordable energy systems and supply chains. We will strive to identify solutions that mitigate negative externalities and generate benefits for people and preserve our natural resources. We will cooperate on knowledge-building and sharing with trusted international partners and promote AI skills and talent development in the energy sector.</p><p>- We task relevant Ministers to advance these commitments by delivering a workplan on AI and energy, before the end of this year, including working with international and industry partners to provide ongoing data analysis.</p><p>Expand mutually beneficial partnerships with emerging markets and developing country partners to increase access to AI for everyone.</p><p>- We will harness trusted and secure AI technology to promote growth and enable partners to tackle the unique challenges they face. To do this, we will leverage our combined expertise, resources and networks to bridge gaps in AI infrastructure and capacity, invest in locally led AI-enabled innovations, and voluntarily collaborate with local universities to share knowledge and access to AI on mutually agreed terms.</p><p>- We will deliver this by aligning our efforts through initiatives including AI for Development, AI Hub for Sustainable Development, Current AI, FAIR Forward, Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group, AI for Public Good, and others. Interested G7 members plan to strengthen the AI for Development Funders Collaborative.</p><p>KANANASKIS COMMON VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, recognize that quantum technologies - which include computing, sensing and communications - have the potential to bring significant and transformative benefits to societies worldwide. Significant R&amp;D breakthroughs over the past decade mean that these technologies are now poised to create economic and social benefits in sectors such as finance, communication, transport, energy, health and agriculture while addressing global challenges. They could also have far reaching implications for national and international security, as they enable new defence capabilities and threaten current data protection systems.</p><p>We acknowledge that achieving quantum technologies' full potential will require international collaboration between governments, researchers and industry to mobilize investments and optimize resources; advance research and commercialization; secure supply chains; facilitate access to infrastructure, talent and markets; align adoption with shared interests and values; and create a trusted ecosystem to manage risks and unleash innovation.</p><p>To this end, we commit to:</p><p>1. Promote public and private investment in quantum science and technology R&amp;D, responsible innovation and commercialization; and support partnerships between researchers, industry and other stakeholders to accelerate commercialization and attract private investment.</p><p>2. Promote the development and adoption of beneficial applications of quantum technologies in a variety of sectors, including those developed by small and medium sized enterprises.</p><p>3.

Across Tanzania, settlement areas exposed to high flood risk grew by approximately 120 percent between 1985 and 2015.</p><p>As Tanzania strives to sustain and accelerate its growth trajectory, these challenges threaten to hinder the country's economic gains.</p><p>In 2018, floods in Dar es Salaam cost $100 million or approximately 2% of the city's gross domestic product. The realities of a changing climate are only exacerbating these challenges. Climate impacts to Tanzania's transport infrastructure, for instance, currently cost $108-109 million each year and could rise to $198-233 million by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the Government of Tanzania has stepped up efforts to develop solutions that usher in a more disaster-resilient future for its cities.</p><p>Tanzania has underscored its commitment to disaster risk reduction as a top priority in its National Five-Year Development Plan (2021-26).</p><p>The World Bank and GFDRR remain steadfast partners in these efforts.</p><p>Spanning more than a decade, this partnership with Tanzania has deepened the country's understanding of disaster risks, enabled better planning to reduce that risk, informed transformative investments for urban resilience, and strengthened policy and institutional frameworks for disaster risk management and financing.</p><p>Ahead of the GFDRR Partnership Days in Tanzania (June 24-27, 2025), we take a closer look at the major highlights of this partnership and at complementary efforts by other development partners and initiatives.</p><p>The Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management (DRM) in Developing Countries (Japan Program) has also played a significant role. The ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program, a joint initiative of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, the European Union, the World Bank and GFDRR, provided additional support.</p><p>GFDRR, including through the City Resilience Program (CRP), has supported climate and disaster risk assessments in the Msimbazi Basin in Dar es Salaam. Taking a deep dive into the economic impacts of flooding, those assessments revealed, for example, that floods disproportionately affect areas with high employment densities.</p><p>Through the Japan Program, GFDRR has supported a comprehensive resilience assessment of urban transport networks in Dodoma and Arusha to inform planning and investments to better manage flood risk. By using flood hazard modeling, transport network analysis, and other methods, the assessment found that 10.5% of Dodoma's road network would likely be affected by an extreme flood event, and identified the five wards with the highest concentration of risk.</p><p>Recent GFDRR-supported analytical work has also included city resilience diagnostics and hazard risk assessments for 12 cities. In Dar es Salaam, GFDRR has also supported a water sector resilience and drought preparedness assessment and stocktaking of infrastructure design and construction designs and standards. At the national level, a comprehensive review of the government's disaster risk management and climate resilience policies was conducted.</p><p>These initiatives complemented work supported by TURP, including development of a probabilistic flood model for Dar es Salaam. That model, which has been used by at least five Tanzanian government agencies, has quantified flood hazards from pluvial, fluvial, and tidal sources and also helped estimate potential losses under varying climate change and urban development scenarios.</p><p>GFDRR supported the Ramani Huria initiative, a community-mapping project that trained university students and local community members to create open-source maps of Dar es Salaam's most flood-prone areas.</p><p>Using aerial and street-level imagery, GPS-enabled mobile apps, and drones, Ramani Huria mapped 29 wards (home to 1.3 million citizens) and 1,254 kilometers of waterways and 3,396 kilometers of roads. These maps generated provide valuable information about likely flood risk in vulnerable neighborhoods and reflect the knowledge of those most directly affected.</p><p>Building on this inclusive and participatory model to resilience-building, TURP supported the Resilience Academy, which was first launched in 2019, and has since enabled 1,400 young Tanzanians to develop skills in data collection, community engagement, and mapping.</p><p>Subsequently, a GFDRR-funded pilot supported Resilience Academy participants to produce detailed tree-cover maps of Dar es Salaam. Those maps have helped urban planners identify inequities in canopy coverage across the city.</p><p>GFDRR support has informed and enabled a range of transformative World Bank investments across the country.</p><p>Local voices are increasingly shaping the design and implementation of these investments, with co-design elements supported by technical assistance from the facility.</p><p>Through the $330 million first phase of the Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project (closed in 2023), planners rehabilitated or constructed 75 kilometers of main stormwater drains.21 These interventions have reduced flood risk in Dar es Salaam and protected over 400 hectares of urban land from flooding.22 Overall, 4.1 million people have benefitted from the improvements to urban services and infrastructure.23</p><p>Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project (Phase 1 )</p><p>Through the $330 million first phase of the Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project (closed in 2023), planners rehabilitated or constructed 75 kilometers of main stormwater drains. These interventions have reduced flood risk in Dar es Salaam, and protected over 400 hectares of urban land from flooding. Overall, 4.1 million people have benefitted from the improvements to urban services and infrastructure.</p><p>Tanzania Cities Transforming Infrastructure &amp; Competitiveness (TACTIC) Project</p><p>The $278 million Tanzania Cities Transforming Infrastructure &amp; Competitiveness (TACTIC) Project (approved June 2022) is strengthening urban management and resilient infrastructure for 5.5 million people spanning 45 cities across Tanzania. In keeping with GFDRR's commitment to co-creating resilience solutions, support is being provided to local government authorities to engage community groups on the development of community resilience plans.</p><p>Msimbazi Basin Development Project</p><p>The $260 million Msimbazi Basin Development Project (approved September 2022) is strengthening flood resilience across 420 hectares of the Msimbazi Basin, while also creating 2,000 jobs. It includes moving the most vulnerable households out of high-risk flood zones as a preventive measure, and developing resilient real estate, with the latter supported by CRP. GFDRR's experts working on nature-based solutions are also supporting the development of a large urban park with a flood retention function, among other interventions, to complement structural drainage works.</p><p>Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project (Phase 2)</p><p>The $330 million second phase of the Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project (approved December 2023) is strengthening climate-resilient urban infrastructure and services for 3.3 million people in the Dar es Salaam region. It includes solid waste management interventions to improve service delivery, among other initiatives to strengthen flood resilience, improve human health, and create jobs .</p><p>Dodoma Integrated and Sustainable Transport (DIST) Project</p><p>The $200 million Dodoma Integrated and Sustainable Transport (DIST) Project (approved March 2025) is improving resilient urban mobility in Dodoma through upgraded corridors, resilient access routes, and enhanced walking and cycling infrastructure. The project will create over 10,000 new jobs by 2030, benefiting more than 430,000 people.</p><p>Strengthening Policy and Institutional Frameworks for Disaster Risk Management and Financing</p><p>GFDRR has supported the Government of Tanzania's assessment of legal, policy and institutional frameworks for disaster resilience, paving the way for key reforms.</p><p>- For example, the facility helped implement a policy that operationalizes the 2022 Disaster Management Act, setting national priorities, and addressing barriers to action. The law established clear coordination mechanisms for disaster management interventions across ministries, agencies, regional secretariats, local governments and the private sector.</p><p>- Tanzania's progress on reforms across sectors including urban development, energy, water, and health led to the World Bank's approval in June 2025 of $100 million Development Policy Financing (DPF) as budget support and $200 million allotted to a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO). Expected to benefit 1.9 million people, this new financing will help ensure that Tanzania will have the resources it needs to recover and rebuild without delay after a disaster or emergency, while also receiving continued support to advance its ambitious reform agenda.</p><p>Coming Together at the GFDRR Partnership Days</p><p>Spanning across a range of the facility's thematic areas, from disaster risk analytics to emergency preparedness and response to city resilience, GFDRR is committed to further deepening its long-term engagement with Tanzania.</p><p>It is in that spirit that GFDRR is hosting the next edition of the GFDRR Partnership Days in Tanzania from June 24 to 27, 2025. This event will bring together government officials, GFDRR members, observers, partners, and World Bank staff to exchange insights and lessons that can inform resilience-building in Tanzania and beyond.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2R-T2S3-RXKW-03HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 19, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Disposal Standards</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEZBQUU3OTJGRDU4NDE1Nzg0Q0I1QTBBM0M2QzMyMEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTVBMjY4ODg4OEM2NEIyMDg1MDBFQTVDQTgwNTczRTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Initiative &amp;

The Grand Junction Waterworks Company was actually formed in 1811, while the Napoleonic war was still raging, to supply clean drinking water from the junction of the grand union canal in Paddington to households for Londoners. In need of cleaner sources of water, the company moved its operation to Kew, then outside London in 1838, and built this magnificent pumping station with its huge steam engines to pump the water to London. As London grew and needed more water, the company grew and became more profitable until, in 1905, it was taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board along with several other private water suppliers to provide a unified public water supply system for London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reliable supply of water that is clean and safe to drink - or to give it the description the Victorians put into law and that we still use today, the supply of water that is wholesome, is a prerequisite of modern life and it is something that we have become used to and take for granted.</p><p>And the same is true of that other prerequisite of modern life, effective sanitation. 20 years after this pumping house opened, London experienced the 'Great Stink' of 1858. After years of suffering a cesspit and sewer system that could not cope with London's growth, with the Thames a pestiferous and reeking abomination to quote a newspaper of the time, a decision to close the cesspits followed by a hot dry summer brought matters to a head as the Thames became, to quote Disraeli, a Stygian pool reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors. Parliament, literally disabled by the stench, woke up and finally acted. It gave clear direction to the newly formed London Board of Works which in turn adopted the plan of its chief engineer, Joseph Bazalgette. Over the next 15 years, he oversaw the construction of over 1,100 miles of sewers and massive pumping stations that transformed the health of London.</p><p>I have more than once thought of the 'Great Stink' when leading the Independent Commission on Water over the last 9 months. While today we enjoy safe water and clean sanitation to a level that would have been unimaginable 165 years ago, there are many parallels: a system under huge pressure from economic and population growth, years of discussion and competing plans as the problem grew, government that did not give clear direction, a level of pollution in our waterways that the public will not tolerate and a point at which it became apparent to all that a fundamental reset was needed. And actually, there is a parallel there - that a bonus for Bazalgette was blocked because it was deemed to too high.</p><p>Today the Commission publishes its report which I hope will contribute to that 'reset' that the Government has committed to and that we sorely need. The report is long and detailed - some 460 pages with 88 recommendations covering everything from strategic direction and planning to regulator reform to the water industry supply chain. In an earlier speech I paraphrased Tolstoy to observe that 'while all are unhappy with the current situation, everyone is unhappy in his own way'. Now, looking at the length and scope of the final report I wonder if we have written a Russian novel in response!</p><p>But I would defend that length and scope on two grounds. First, and most obviously, the Terms of Reference set asked the Commission to answer these questions, which we have tried to do. But second, and more importantly, if we are to achieve the water sector we need, we need to look at all the factors that have contributed to our 'Great Stink' moment and recognise that those factors, if not addressed, will hamper us going forward.</p><p>The water industry, of course, is at the heart of this. And the industry, as a whole, has not met public expectations or maintained public trust in recent years. Some companies have manifestly acted in their private interest but against the public interest. That must be prevented in future. But the industry does not exist in a vacuum. It sits within a framework of law and regulation that operates under the strategic direction of government. And it is not the only demand on our water systems, or the only contributor to the current state of our waterways.</p><p>The Commission's report is long and detailed with multiple recommendations because - as I have said - there is no one, single reform, no matter how radical, that will deliver what is needed: we need to act on all of the failures that have brought us to the present pass.</p><p>Now, you will be very relieved to hear that I do not intend here to go through all 460 pages and 88 recommendations. But I will highlight, if you permit me, the main themes of the report and pull out some of key recommendations.</p><p>First, we need truly strategic direction from government. Barely a week goes by without someone calling for 'a strategy' from you, so it is important to set out I mean by this and the challenges it will entail.</p><p>We need to guide the use and development of our water systems and the restoration of our water environment as a whole and over the longer term. We need to chart a path for the delivery of the environmental improvements that the public want to see: to restore ecosystems and sustain our precious waterways for decades to come. However, there are many competing demands on our water systems. Demands to abstract water, demands to discharge into water and demands to enjoy water for recreation.</p><p>Only government can set the overall objectives for water and the timescale for achieving them. Only government can set the broad priorities, balance demands when they compete and coordinate the different elements of the system. And only government can decide who should pay and how much the nation can afford. It is relatively easy to set down a list of objectives. Effective strategic governance and guidance is much, much harder. It requires striking difficult balances, making difficult choices, and taking a long-term view.</p><p>In the report we recommend government in England and government in Wales produce a National Water Strategy. We set out in detail what it should cover, how it should be produced, and how it should be enshrined in statute to ensure consistent direction can be maintained over the long term. I have no illusions that it will be easy to produce: to govern is to choose but to govern is hard. But, as with the 'Great Stink' in 1858, without such direction from the very top, we will not achieve the change we need.</p><p>To connect that high level strategy to action, we need to learn how to manage and plan for water as a system or rather, as a set of regional water systems. Our river basins, aquifers and coasts and the demands upon them constitute complex systems and they need to be managed as such. The water industry, agriculture, transport, local development and land use, and environmental regulation all affect the regional water system and the water catchments that it comprises.</p><p>As many respondents to the Commission observed, we are very poor at system planning for water. There are huge, confusing and overlapping planning processes for water industry processes - the industry produces at least nine plans in a process that costs hundreds of millions. These plans drive water industry investment. But there are no such processes driving action in the other sectors that have an impact on the water system. And some water industry plans are not connected to local government development plans or to local voices or those sectors that also have an impact.</p><p>Opportunities for local government, agriculture, and water companies and other actors to work together are missed. Opportunities, for example, to implement sustainable drainage schemes that avoid storm water overloading our sewers and causing sewage spills into rivers, or opportunities to balance the nutrient loads that cause such unsightly and destructive algae to bloom in water bodies. And heavy engineering - concrete - solutions to environmental problems are pursued despite local preference for more natural solutions.</p><p>Drawing on experience from other countries, the Commission is recommending that regional water system planning bodies are established in England and a national system planner is established in Wales. These would not be advisory bodies or 'talking shops'. Rather, they would take over the role played by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales at present with real authority over water industry investment and real influence over other funding streams that can be directed achieving regional water system objectives, such as agricultural grants.</p><p>To be clear, this would not be the creation of a new level of bureaucracy. Rather it would bring existing functions together on a regional water system basis, in England, and a national basis in Wales. It would streamline existing planning processes (the current water industry processes will be streamlined into two plans - one for drinking water and one for wastewater) and most importantly, it would link local development to water system investment, avoiding the situations we see at present where housing and economic development projects are blocked because the regional water systems cannot cope with them.</p><p>Alongside strategic direction and regional water system planning, the legislative framework for water is key a part of determining the overall framework for the management of water in England and Wales. The current framework has driven great improvements in certain areas. Drinking water and sanitation standards are now world-leading. Bathing water quality has considerably improved. But the current framework is also complex, inconsistent and out of date and highly prescriptive. The Commission has therefore recommended that it be reviewed to bring the legislation up to date, particularly with regard to the Water Framework Directive which sets the high-level objectives for the environmental quality of water bodies.</p><p>The Water Framework Directive sets a target to be achieved by 2027 - at a minimum - and the review will need to consider what targets should be set for after that date. We recommend, however, that the government use the opportunity to consider the scope of the legislation. One area in which we see there is a strong case for broadening the scope of the legislation is to include public health, given the increase in the recreational use of water in recent years. We recommend in England and Wales the Chief Medical Officers are asked to chair task forces to consider how to effectively bring public health into the water quality legislation.</p><p>Over the last 9 months I have heard consistent criticism not of the ambition of the environmental legislation, which must be preserved in any review, but about the inflexibility that requires and drives regulators to focus on narrow, engineering solutions rather than being able to take a broader view of overall environmental and other benefits such as may be found in nature based solutions. We recommend also that the review should aim to make the legislation less prescriptive and provide for 'constrained discretion' to enable regulators and local system planning bodies to take decisions in the round on how best to meet environmental objectives.</p><p>Strategic guidance, systems planning and legislation - they can set the broad framework. But delivering the outcomes we want for water depends most importantly on having not just the right strategy, legislation and plans. It depends crucially on having the right regulators, regulators that command public confidence and industry respect, regulators that have the capacity and the capability to do their job effectively. And, most important in the Commission's view, in the same way as strategic guidance, system planning and legislation, a structure of regulation that can focus on the water system in the round.</p><p>Our assessment is that the current environmental and economic regulators have not achieved what is needed and will not achieve what is needed. There are many reasons for this. It is clear that the Environment Agency has not had the resources, the people, skills, technology to hold the water industry and other sectors that impact the water environment to account. And it is beginning to change I am pleased to say. We're calling for reform of Operator Self Monitoring - moving from water company sampling to digitalised, automated systems - ensuring real-time, accurate data. Crucially, this must sit alongside tightened enforcement of abstraction limits, sludge management, and drinking-water standards.</p><p>And on the economic side, for much of the last 20 years, Ofwat was encouraged to regulate with a lighter touch and to focus on keeping bills down. And it did not have the powers or the capability to supervise the financial structure of much of the industry, which allowed some companies and their owners to take decisions which reflected their private interests but badly damaged both their companies and in the longer term the public interest. We are seeing some of the consequences of that failure to defend the public interest in the news every day. I will return later to this question of how in an industry of private monopoly companies the private interest can be brought into alignment with the public interest and whether the regulator has sufficient powers to ensure that this happens.</p><p>When the water industry was privatised Ofwat was established to protect consumers from monopoly power by setting the prices that the water companies charge, to incentivise investment, and to create proxies for competition through financial incentives to drive efficiency. In line with other privatised utilities, Ofwat's approach to regulation was built around econometric modelling of the notionally efficient company to provide the benchmarks for setting prices and financial incentives and sanctions. And the decades immediately following privatisation, investment and efficiency grew. The quality of treated wastewater and bathing water have improved. There has been a 41% decrease in leakage in England since privatisation, driven particularly in the 1990s.</p><p>But in more recent decades performance of the industry has plateaued as the public goods demanded of the water industry have grown. In response Ofwat has developed and intensified its use of econometric tools and industry wide benchmarks. The Commission recognises the motivation behind this. But our assessment is that this has taken this approach beyond the limits of its effectiveness and, indeed, to a point where it may have become counterproductive in terms of the performance of the industry as a whole and its ability to attract investment.</p><p>In the Commission's view, it is important to have an objective framework for setting prices and incentives based on modelled outputs and based on comparability between companies, this approach alone, no matter how aggressively pursued, cannot drive the improvement of the sector to deliver the public goods that are necessary nor to attract the. There needs to be a fundamental rebalancing of the approach to economic regulation and oversight of water companies towards a closer, judgment-based, supervisory engagement with individual water companies. This will require an equally fundamental shift in capability and also in regulatory culture, which in the Commission's view has become too adversarial on both sides.</p><p>The Commission's report sets out how a new 'duty to supervise' should be enshrined in statute, how a judgement based supervisory approach might be implemented and the expert capability it would need in financing and engineering that would be necessary. We also make several important recommendations as to how the price review process - which should be retained alongside and informed by supervisory engagement - might be simplified and reformed. These include changes to the framework of delivery incentives, the allocation of bill revenues to infrastructure renewal, operational maintenance and enhancement expenditure, to the calculation of the return on capital and debt and to the appeals process.</p><p>While changes to economic regulation are necessary, however, they will not address the fragmented regulatory landscape for the water industry. Water companies' costs, investments, plans and performance are overseen by four regulators at present in England - Ofwat, the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Drinking Water Inspectorate. Each has a different focus, different objectives and different requirements that overlap and are often in tension. The Environment Agency determines much of the industry's investment needs but the industry's revenues are determined by Ofwat. Companies can be sanctioned by both Ofwat and the EA for the same pollution incidents. Funding of maintenance and infrastructure renewal are the responsibility of Ofwat but the environmental consequences of ageing infrastructure are the responsibility of the EA, as we saw from the report that was published last week.</p><p>The regulatory structure at privatisation was set up with separate regulators. As the overlaps have grown and the environmental and other standards have been raised, the need for coordination and resolution of different objectives has grown.</p><p>The Commission has not approached the option of major structural change lightly. It is never an easy option. I am all too aware, after many years in the public service, of the costs and risks of breaking up and reforming institutional structures. These costs and risks go beyond the financial: they include the human costs of organisational change, the deflection of management time and focus, the risk of dropping the ball on key objectives, and the breaking up of internal synergies and the need to create new interfaces between organisations.</p><p>The Commission has looked hard at potential for coordination mechanisms to address the tensions and overlaps we have identified. Our conclusion, however, is that if the primary objective is securing the reset and long-term change that we need in the water sector, we need an integrated regulator for water.</p><p>The Commission recommends, therefore, that in England, Ofwat, the water related environmental protection functions of the EA, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, and the water related function of Natural England, be brought together into a new integrated Regulator for Water. For Wales, which has a different institutional structure, we recommend that the economic regulatory functions now carried out for Wales by Ofwat be transferred to a Welsh economic regulation function located in Natural Resources Wales.</p><p>The new regulator for water will become responsible for Ofwat's current duties and roles to protect consumers. But, in line with its Terms of Reference, the Commission has also looked at the broader arrangements for vulnerable customers and those for consumer redress and consumer advocacy currently carried out by CCW.</p><p>We have to recognise that the cost of producing water and wastewater services is likely to increase over the medium and longer term as the industry has to replace ageing assets, respond to higher environmental and public health standards and continue to adapt to the challenges of rising population growth and climate change. Against that likely background of rising costs and rising bills, there is a need for a stronger safety net for the most vulnerable who are exposed to water poverty. Water companies already operate social tariffs, spreading the cost of supporting vulnerable customers across their customer base. But the effects of higher costs of water in different parts of the country have different impacts and there is already significant variation in bills that vulnerable customers pay, even taking into account local social tariffs.</p><p>It is for government to decide whether and how far to equalise support for the vulnerable in different parts of the country and it is for government to decide to what extent this should be done through water bills as part of a national social tariff, or through other means of support such as the social security system. It is of course for elected government rather than the Commission to decide between those options. The Government has now taken the powers to introduce a national social tariff, and in line with our assessment that stronger support will be needed for the most vulnerable, the Commission recommends that such a tariff be implemented. However, we make no recommendation on the design, the level of support and the degree to which there should be cross subsidy between customers of different water companies. These are highly distributional decisions, and such decisions are not for technocrats but for government to make.</p><p>We have also made a number of recommendations on consumer redress and consumer advocacy. On redress, unlike other regulated sectors, there is no mandatory dispute mechanism for customers. The Commission believes that water company customers should have the protection of a statutory ombudsman as exists, for example, in energy. And given the CCW's expertise in this area, the Commission recommends it be upgraded to become the Ombudsman for Water, with Citizens Advice, which has proved to be a powerful consumer advocate and advisory service for customers in other regulated sectors, taking over the role of consumer advocacy for water customers.</p><p>In addition, changes we have recommended to the water company Price Review process will also allow appeals against the price determination to be brought by consumers as well as by water companies - again as is possible in other regulated sectors.</p><p>Taken as a whole, the changes the Commission proposes should lead to more effective, joined-up regulation and stronger protections for consumers. In the Commission's judgement, if implemented effectively, they will address the shortcomings in regulation that lie at the heart of the poor performance, underinvestment and the failure to protect the public interest that we have seen over recent years.</p><p>Regulation must be a key line of defence to protect the public interest. A system of private regulated monopoly utilities - as I have said - will only work if private interests of water companies and their owners are aligned with the public interest in the production of public goods. That is the job of regulation, economic and environmental, to ensure that alignment so that companies are incentivised to produce public goods and avoid public harms.</p><p>But, taking the sector as a whole, water companies themselves and their owners must bear a large part of the responsibility for the failures we have seen. Water companies are private companies and their owners are entitled to a return on their investment. But those returns must not come at the expense of the public interest. Water companies operate under licence and the public purpose of their operations is inherent in those licences. Sadly, we have over recent decades seen examples in which companies have pursued their short term private interest at the expense of the public interest and of the long term resilience of the company.</p><p>A large number of the responses to the Commission's Call for Evidence expressed disquiet and concern at the inclusion of the profit motives in the provision of water. And I do understand the concerns raised by many about profit in the provision of water and wastewater given some of the experiences we've heard. Some proposed nationalisation or municipalisation or the transfer of for-profit water companies to not-for-profit or similar models. The Commission considered these in line with our Terms of Reference which focus on a privately owned regulated sector and rule out nationalisation or the purchase of companies with public funds for transfer to other ownership models.</p><p>But we also examined the performance of different ownership and operational models, public and private, in other jurisdictions. We published our initial analysis in the Call for Evidence, and we invited respondents to submit further analysis and evidence. We have refined our analysis and have published it in full in the final report. I have to say, on the data and comparable metrics available, the truth is that we did not see evidence of a causal link between ownership models and a range of environmental and other performance indicators.</p><p>We took from this work two conclusions. First, the regulatory model is key to performance and we need to address regulation. Second, where companies are privately owned it is the business model of the owners, the level of return they seek on their investment, their time horizon for that return, their preference for dividends or capital gain and their willingness to invest further in their company for a fair return. Those are the things that make the difference.</p><p>At privatisation it was envisaged that water companies would be owned by long-term investors looking for relatively low risk, low return investments as might be expected form a regulated monopoly utility. Investment vehicles have changed markedly since privatisation. Many investors, including institutional investors, now prefer private, whether listed or unlisted, it remains the case that the industry and the public interest is best served by long term, low risk, low return investors.</p><p>The changes to regulation, particularly to economic regulation, are intended in part to lower regulatory risk and to reduce the variability of returns that deter such investors. The Commission has also recommended that Government make the stability of the regulatory system an objective in the National Water Strategy and that maintaining the investability of the sector becomes one of the duties of new regulator for water.</p><p>But, just as we need to attract longer term investors to the sector with more predictable regulation, we will need to ensure that owners and managers do not act against the public interest and damage the financial resilience of companies.</p><p>So the Commission is recommending giving the new regulator the power where necessary to block changes of ownership, to set gearing levels and, in certain circumstances, to give direction to the ultimate controller of the company. These powers exist in other regulated sectors and they are necessary guardrails in water. We are also recommending making the public purpose of companies clear in the licence condition, bringing company governance in line with the governance code for listed companies and bringing in a statutory for the very senior management cadre, drawing on the experience of the senior managers regime in the financial sector.</p><p>I am, you will be pleased to hear, coming to the end. I hope it will not seem like a Russian novel of a report. The final area that all these changes have to address - from strategic guidance to planning to regulation to company performance - is the health of our water industry infrastructure and of the resilience of our water and wastewater systems.</p><p>We simply do not know the overall health of the system. Ofwat last oversaw a full assessment over 20 years ago. The asset health measures used in price reviews have been backward-looking, measuring past failure rates to determine and fund the amount and the rate of renewal and other capital maintenance necessary to keep the system operating. Much of water industry infrastructure is underground and very difficult to assess and different companies have different ways of assessing asset health. Not all water company assets are mapped.</p><p>We do not know whether enough replacement and renewal has been funded and carried out over the past. But there is strong evidence that we may be considerably behind the game.</p><p>When the Scottish regulator switched from using backward-looking indicators, similar to those Ofwat have used, to a forward-looking in-depth assessment, the conclusion was that there had been material underfunding of capital maintenance. Other countries replace and renew at much faster rates than we have maintained. And, as we heard last week from the Environment Agency, infrastructure failure is a major reason for the pollution incidents we are seeing.</p><p>So, the Commission is recommending that a forward-looking assessment of our infrastructure is carried out and that national resilience standards are developed for water.</p><p>The massive steam pumping engines that filled this engine house operated for over a hundred years and were retired only when steam gave way to diesel and electricity. A couple of weeks ago I visited a much more modern pumping engine hall, just over 50 years old filled with electric pumps that supply drinking water for one third of Londoners. It is a single point of failure for the water supply of all of Canary Wharf. And it is on its last legs. A \\xA3400m project to replace the entire facility has finally been approved and work is about to begin on the replacement. Given the limited space and need to keep the facility operating, it is a hugely complex project that will take at least 7 years.</p><p>I raise this example not merely to contrast the standard of Victorian engineering with its more modern successors, absolutely humbling though that is. It is also an example of the forethought, timescale, planning and funding necessary to ensure that our water infrastructure continues to serve us into the future, and of the dangers of a patch and mend approach.</p><p>I started this speech with the Great Stink of 1858 and the reset it triggered. Change did not happen overnight; it took Bazalgette over 15 years to complete his sewer network and for London's health to be transformed. I hope, following our own Great Stink moment, that the recommendations in the Commission's report will launch the reset that is required. Likewise, change will not happen overnight, and trust will take time to come back. But I very much hope we are now at the beginning of the road.</p><p>Finally, it has been a real privilege to lead this work, and as I conclude I would like to thank the Commission Advisory Group for their help, their insight and support and, most of all, the amazingly committed and hard-working Commission Secretariat team for all they've done. Any credit for this report goes to them; any criticism resides with me.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB1-5BV3-RRV8-M2HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000DR88</classCode><className>METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MCB (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

Compared to the \\xA3470 million (550 million) they spent in 2020 - the last normal year before prices soared - the organisation estimates that they have paid over 2.5 times more since February 2022 than they would have if costs had stayed stable.</p><p>Though prices have come down from the peak they remain high and the ECIU says, if they stay that way in 2024, it would mean an additional \\xA3285 million (334 million) spent this year - 60 per cent more than they would have spent in 2020.</p><p>Farmer protests are in the news, and one of the commonly cited reasons is the price they are having to pay to grow their crops and feed their animals, says Tom Lancaster, land analyst at ECIU.</p><p>Farmers have been paying a 'gas price penalty' on fertilisers, and bad news is that seems set to continue into 2024.</p><p>Why are fertiliser prices so high?</p><p>The price of fertiliser spiralled upwards leading up to and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago. It hit unprecedented highs in the summer of 2022 when prices almost quadrupled compared to the average in 2020.</p><p>Costs are closely tied to gas prices as making artificial fertilisers relies on the use of natural gas. Manufacturing nitrogen-based fertilisers requires nitrogen from the air to be mixed with hydrogen from natural gas at high temperatures and pressure to create ammonia.</p><p>A combination of sanctions, plans to reduce reliance on Russian supplies and overall shortages have increased natural gas prices over the last few years. And analysts have warned that they are projected to stay high for the next decade.</p><p>The UK is already starting to see the consequences of this with high gas prices cited as the main reason for the closure of the UK's biggest ammonia plant in Billingham last year.</p><p>The gas price crisis has revealed that a lot of UK production is dependent on imported fertilisers and pesticides, says Colin Chappell, a farmer from Lincolnshire.</p><p>With high fertiliser costs here to stay, there is growing pressure on farmers' finances and ramifications for consumers from food price inflation.</p><p>What are the alternatives to chemical fertilisers?</p><p>Farmers are considering natural solutions to insulate themselves from high costs and interruptions in supplies.</p><p>New schemes from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in England offer farmers payments for methods like cover crops and herbal leys that help to naturally build the health and fertility of the soil. These could also reduce farmers' reliance on expensive chemical fertilisers, replacing volatile imported nutrients.</p><p>Farming with nature, Chappell says, can give farmers independence, increasing the resilience of food production and building food security.</p><p>With price pressures mounting, it doesn't make sense for me to keep handing so much money over to big fertiliser companies when I can get paid to achieve more sustainable crop nutrition through these new schemes.</p><p>As a bonus, many of these methods of naturally improving soil health are also some of the most effective ways of absorbing carbon and reducing river pollution and may also benefit wildlife like birds and pollinators.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCR-YTC1-DXMS-8007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 22, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Energy &amp;

Ms. Sonali Dayaratne underlined the significance of integrated, systemic approaches and continuous collaboration across sectors, reflecting UNDP's commitment to systems design-based methodologies.</p><p>Iqbal Abdullah Harun, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, emphasized the complex and unpredictable nature of environmental challenges in Bangladesh. He highlighted the country's unique vulnerabilities across diverse topographical regions and advocated for nuanced, localized, and participatory environmental solutions. He stressed the need for balancing biodiversity protection with community livelihoods and underscored the government's initiatives, including funding for small-scale environmental projects and developing an ecosystem valuation framework</p><p>Guests underscored the importance of area-based programming and integrated approach for maximizing the benefits if Nature based Solutions and Locally-led Adaptation for building climate change resilience of the Sundarbans Catchment Area, Bangladesh</p><p>Participants actively engaged in dynamic discussions during the workshop, centering on tangible processes and data exploration. Emphasizing the need to develop local expertise and increase awareness of NbS, the discussions highlighted the critical role of these practices. The attendees underscored the necessity of collaborative efforts among government agencies and the value of shared learning experiences among diverse participants. The focus was on the effective use of data and knowledge to gauge the impact of NbS, particularly in understanding their benefits. Involving communities reliant on the Sundarbans' resources, the group advocated for enhancing local capabilities, promoting NbS practices, and elevating awareness at the grassroots level. The conversation also highlighted the need to align with global and regional objectives for better resource allocation and decision-making. Implementing NbS was advised to be gradual, purposeful, and adaptable. Furthermore, enhancing cooperation between various government departments and facilitating mutual learning among stakeholders were key factors for success.</p><p>The workshop underscored UNDP's renewed commitment to enhancing the resilience of the Sundarbans and its surrounding regions-an important haven for diverse wildlife, a natural shield against severe weather events, and a critical source of sustenance and income for millions who rely on it. The atmosphere was charged with enthusiasm and cooperative energy as attendees exchanged insights, shared their enthusiasm, and envisioned targeted programs to foster sustainable development in the area. This joint effort will fortify partnerships to secure a sustainable future for the Sundarbans and their communities. The insights gained from this workshop will be instrumental in promoting and sculpting initiatives and approaches vital for the health and preservation of this ecologically crucial area.</p><p>Looking forward, the impetus from this workshop is critical. UNDP calls on all parties involved-government agencies, development allies, international and local NGOs, civic groups, academic institutions, and individuals-to be actively involved in safeguarding this unique ecosystem. Your participation is vital in formulating policies, enacting sustainable methods, and guaranteeing the survival of this essential mangrove forest. We must come together, adopting eco-friendly solutions and community-driven adjustments for a lasting and robust future. Engage in neighborhood projects, keep abreast of regional progress, and champion the preservation and sustainable growth of the Sundarbans. Your involvement can significantly impact this key ecosystem's preservation, flourishing future, and reliant communities. Let's collaborate for a thriving and prosperous Sundarbans.</p><p>The National Workshop organized by the UNDP in Dhaka marked a significant step toward integrating Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) and Locally Led Adaptation (LLA) in Bangladesh's prominent mangrove forest. This event followed a subnational workshop in Khulna on 11th October 2023, which involved key local stakeholders from CSOs, NGOs, INGOs, Government of Bangladesh officials, and researchers from various organizations. The Dhaka workshop brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, fostering discussions on environmental and community resilience. Through collaborative efforts and a shared vision, the workshop laid the groundwork for ongoing and future initiatives aimed at preserving and enhancing this crucial ecosystem. The commitment to building resilience and sustainable development in the region was clearly evident, paving the way for impactful and long-lasting change.</p><p>(United Nations Development Programme)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B4P-Y3D1-DXMS-804Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1374\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 22, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Initiative &amp;

Hundreds of lives were lost, and critical infrastructure - from drainage systems to schools - was destroyed. The Cyclone Idai and Kenneth Emergency Recovery and Resilience Project was launched in response, aiming not only to rebuild but to strengthen climate resilience, particularly in Beira, a city severely affected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This project, co-financed by World Bank and German cooperation through KfW, integrated green and grey infrastructure. It is being delivered through a shared implementation structure, reinforcing government leadership and reducing fragmentation. It also foreshadowed the deepened collaboration formalized in a 2024 co-financing framework agreement between the World Bank and KfW. That agreement provides a roadmap for joint projects with harmonized standards and coordinated approaches - laying the groundwork for more impactful co-financing efforts going forward.</p><p>In this conversation, Xavier Chavana, a Senior Disaster Risk Management Specialist for the World Bank in Mozambique, and KfW colleagues Ingo Baum and Susana Gomes, both Portfolio Managers for Good Governance and Biodiversity, reflect on how co-financing worked in practice - what enabled it, where the pressure points were, and what lessons it offers for future joint operations.</p><p>Q: This project brought together two major institutions in the wake of a devastating national crisis. What conditions made it possible for this co-financing partnership to deliver effectively in such a demanding setting?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: We were operating in a very complex environment - post-cyclone recovery, institutional fragility, climate risks, and major infrastructure needs. But what helped us move forward was the trust and understanding already built between our teams. We'd worked together on a previous project in Beira, which gave us a solid foundation - a shared sense of purpose and familiarity with the city's needs. That allowed us to focus on delivery rather than alignment.</p><p>Ingo Baum: I agree - what stood out was the level of continuity. Often with projects like these, the teams change and you lose momentum. Our team had worked on the first Beira project, and when we moved into the recovery phase, we were able to build on that. The relationships were already there - with each other, and with the government. And that meant we could focus on delivery rather than getting to know each other's systems from scratch.</p><p>Susana Gomes: We weren't locked into rigid roles. We were able to say: What needs to happen now, and who is best placed to do it? And that flexibility was essential. In a post-disaster context, you don't have time to coordinate every detail from headquarters. You need to empower the teams on the ground.</p><p>Q: Navigating institutional differences - from timelines to procedures to risk frameworks - is often a major hurdle in joint operations. How did you work through those differences in this case?</p><p>Ingo Baum: Alignment wasn't about eliminating differences, it was about managing them. The World Bank and KfW have different internal structures, different approval processes. But we didn't try to harmonize everything. Instead, we figured out where we could complement each other. For example, the Bank moved quickly to advance parts of the feasibility study. That allowed KfW to proceed with its own internal steps more efficiently. It was about sequencing, not duplication.</p><p>Susana Gomes: Exactly. It helped that both institutions are outcome-oriented. We didn't get stuck on whose procurement system would be used for which contract. We asked: what's the most effective way to deliver this? Sometimes that meant KfW taking the lead on certain components, sometimes the Bank. What mattered was that we agreed upfront on the big picture - one project, one roadmap, and a shared long-term vision for what we are trying to achieve - and then found practical solutions to get there.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: And we invested time early on to define that shared vision. There were months of technical preparation and design work before implementation began. We set up a single implementation unit, agreed on reporting lines, and held weekly meetings with the government to track progress and solve issues as they emerged. That kind of coordination is intense, but it's what makes co-financing more than just pooled money. It becomes a joint commitment.</p><p>Q: What were the advantages of co-financing this project? Did co-financing enable more ambitious, integrated solutions? How did that play out in the design and delivery of this project?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: In many cities, you see piecemeal solutions: one project addresses drainage, another focuses on green space or flood protection. In Beira, we had the opportunity to design a single, integrated approach. We combined conventional infrastructure like drainage canals and pumping stations with nature-based solutions - restoring mangroves, expanding retention basins, and rehabilitating the Chiveve River ecosystem. That dual approach not only reduced flood risk, it also created co-benefits for biodiversity and community use.</p><p>Susana Gomes: From KfW's side, this integration was very intentional. On behalf of the German government, we've supported green infrastructure in many countries, but the key in Beira was embedding it within a broader system. That required detailed technical coordination. For example, retention basins had to be placed strategically in relation to the urban drainage works. And those decisions couldn't be made in isolation - they depended on shared data, shared design timelines, and constant dialogue between our teams.</p><p>Ingo Baum: It also required a different mindset. You can't design green-grey infrastructure in silos. You have to start with the question: what combination of interventions will reduce risk and support long-term resilience in this specific place? German cooperation through KfW helped the city set up systems for long-term management. For example, we supported a park management unit to maintain new green infrastructure. This wasn't just about building; it was about making sure it could work - and last.</p><p>Q: A challenge we often hear about in development finance is fragmentation-too many uncoordinated efforts. How does co-financing help reduce that and support more coherent efforts, especially from the country's point of view?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: That's a real risk. If each partner runs its own process, the government ends up coordinating between institutions instead of focusing on delivery. From the outset, we made a conscious decision to avoid that. We agreed to work through a single implementation unit housed in the Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources, and to streamline our engagement with contractors and consultants. In some cases, we even had the same contractor delivering both Bank- and KfW-financed components. That's rare - and it made the project more coherent and efficient.</p><p>Susana Gomes: Many of the government counterparts had worked on earlier phases of the Chiveve project, so we weren't starting from scratch. That institutional memory really helped reduce friction. But more importantly, we were able to build on existing capacity rather than creating something new for the sake of it. That's often the most sustainable way forward.</p><p>Ingo Baum: One of the strengths of co-financing is that it brings more technical expertise to the table - different institutions contribute different skills, and that can really elevate the quality of a project. But it also introduces more complexity in terms of financing and delivery. That complexity only works if the teams - across institutions - can collaborate effectively. The day-to-day decisions, the sequencing, the problem solving - all of that depends on people who trust each other and can work through differences. In the end, coordination isn't just an institutional issue - it's a deeply human one.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: That shared structure also gave local actors more clarity. When different institutions coordinate behind one process, it's easier for implementing partners to engage, plan, and deliver. It reduces confusion and makes the whole project more manageable from the ground up.</p><p>Q: What do we need to get right to unlock more successful co-financing partnerships in the future?</p><p>Ingo Baum: You have to give people room to work. Institutions have their procedures, and that's important - but when the country is facing real challenges, the question isn't Is this a KfW-approved process or a World Bank one? It's: Can we deliver? And to do that, you need people on the ground who are empowered, who know each other, and who are trusted to make decisions. That's what made this work.</p><p>Susana Gomes: This experience showed what's possible when co-financing goes beyond alignment on paper to real collaboration in practice. We weren't just reacting to a crisis - we were helping lay foundations for long-term resilience. That meant thinking not only about what to build, but how to support local capacity to maintain and adapt those solutions in the future.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: Co-financing isn't just about bigger budgets - it's about better outcomes. When it works, it brings together complementary strengths and enables solutions that no one partner could deliver alone.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FY4-D3P3-RSH3-H3BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 2, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000948</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp; PARTNERSHIPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DMX1</classCode><className>CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DSB8</classCode><className>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N523920MM</classCode><className>INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DSB8</classCode><className>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N523920MM</classCode><className>INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC376</classCode><className>MOZAMBIQUE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
