And let me start by just welcoming all of you to the United States Mission to the United Nations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1950, and I was not born yet, former U.S. diplomat Ralph Bunche was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Bunche was a founding father of the United Nations, relentless in his quest for justice and coexistence at home and abroad.</p><p>And in his speech in Oslo, he explained, and I'll quote, Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not fighting. I really like that, so I'm going to use it again, Sarah. Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not fighting. And I also like the fact that he used the word men. Men fighting or not fighting.</p><p>Peace, he said, ...must be translated into bread or rice, shelter, health, and education, as well as freedom and human dignity - a steadily better life.</p><p>A steadily better life. Peace must be translated into bread or rice. He said this in 1950. In 1950. And yet, as we have heard over the past few days, in far too many places across the globe, bread and rice are not reaching people in need. Today.</p><p>A perfect storm of conflict, climate change, and resource constraints have thrust more than 282 million people into acute food insecurity.</p><p>And more than 700 million people worldwide face chronic hunger, nearly a tenth of the world's population.</p><p>In Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Gaza. And yes, right here in the United States, where one in five children face hunger, especially during the summer months when they are not in school.</p><p>Tackling this crisis has been a top priority for the United States government, and it is a top priority for me.</p><p>Thrice now I have had the honor of serving as President of the Security Council, and every single time, I have focused on the same issue - same issue: food security.</p><p>And I'm proud that under our leadership, the Council unanimously put conflict, hunger, and famine at the center of its agenda and that, in a demonstration of solidarity and commitment, 91 UN Member States signed a U.S.-led joint communiqu\\xE9 pledging action to end the use of food as a weapon of war.</p><p>This is in addition to the over $20 billion dollars the United States has provided to fight food security all over the word in the last three years.</p><p>Whether it's helping partner countries build resilience, climate-smart food systems through the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils; Advancing inclusive agriculture through the International Year of the Women Farmer; or working with partner countries to launch initiatives like the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, focusing on soil carbon sequestration and regenerative agriculture practices the United States is committed to achieving SDG2: Zero Hunger.</p><p>But a crisis of this magnitude requires a response equal in scale. A response that brings together governments, civil society groups, and NGOs. People like all of you here in this room. A response that harnesses the immense capacity and expertise of the private sector.</p><p>And I'm so thrilled that we can gather today, and highlight the many ways in which the United States' private sector is working to combat growing threats to food security, all through the lens of sustainability and climate resilience.</p><p>Providing the innovation and education needed to support local farmers, enhance production methods, and increase access to food.</p><p>Creating cutting-edge technology to increase yields and nutritional content, all while using less water, pesticides, and fertilizers.</p><p>Leveraging tools like artificial intelligence to detect disease, predict natural disasters, and help farmers grow more food.</p><p>And helping fund good ideas, bold ideas, through the Private Sector Pledge, which has, to date, mobilized over $600 million dollars from 50 different companies, across 48 countries.</p><p>Today, we'll hear from leaders at Google, Inari, and Bayer - organizations that offer invaluable resources, expertise, and ideas in the fight against hunger.</p><p>To each of these leaders, and to everyone joining us today, know that I am truly grateful for your partnership today and every single day.</p><p>Together - together, we can live up to Ralph Bunche's vision of bread and rice, of a more peaceful, prosperous world. One in which no child - no child goes to bed hungry. So, once again thank you very much for your commitment, for your presence, and for your engagement today.</p><p>Source: U.S. Mission to the United Nations</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CGP-BT71-DXMS-81YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 16, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0FD</classCode><className>FOOD SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000047</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000150</classCode><className>AWARDS &amp;

They also visited Nestl\\xE9's modern coffee processing plant, where products from high-quality Vietnamese coffee beans are created for both domestic consumers and export to international markets.</p><p>Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam has been actively assisting coffee farmers across the country since 2011, in order to meet the growing demand for premium coffee both domestically and internationally. The company has been providing support in various areas, including replanting old coffee trees, promoting regenerative agriculture practices, boosting farmers' income, and integrating production, processing, and export activities. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the value of Vietnamese coffee beans.</p><p>After 12 years of the implementation of the NESCAF\\xC9 Plan in the Central Highlands, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam has distributed more than 73.5 million high-yield, disease-resistant coffee saplings to replant aged coffee plantations. As a result, farmers have reduced the amount of irrigation water by 40-60 per cent, as well as the amount of pesticides and chemical fertilisers by 20 per cent. Farmers also apply the intercropping technique of coffee and pepper to increase land efficiency and biodiversity while reducing environmental emissions.</p><p>As of 2023, 90 per cent of farmers within the surveyed coffee farms have adopted the naturally grown shade method, and 86 per cent of farms have diversified crops with an average of three different species. Thanks to sustainable farming practices, farmers' income has risen by 30 - 100 per cent compared to before participating in the NESCAF\\xC9 Plan. At the same time, all coffee supplied from Viet Nam meets the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) standards for domestic consumption and export to 29 markets worldwide.</p><p>As part of the programme, the international media delegation also visited the Nestl\\xE9 Tr An Factory, which is one of the largest coffee factories in Vietnam, as well as Nestl\\xE9's most modern coffee processing facilities in the region.</p><p>International reporters were introduced to modern production lines following a circular process, ensuring quality throughout the sustainable coffee value chain from farming to purchasing, production, processing, export, and consumption.</p><p>The delegation gained valuable insights into Nestl\\xE9's sustainable farming practices in coffee gardens and also had the opportunity to delve into the company's production sustainability initiatives. These initiatives included exploring circular economy models and the processes involved in treating, recycling, and reusing production waste.</p><p>Annually, 60-65 per cent of wastewater is treated for reuse at the coffee processing factories. Additionally, all coffee grounds are converted into biomass energy, and the sand from the boiler is supplied to partners as a raw material for producing unburnt bricks.</p><p>Since 2015, all of Nestl\\xE9's factories in Vietnam have reached the goal of zero waste to landfill.\"</p><p>Nestl\\xE9 not only produces delectable coffee cups from responsibly cultivated coffee beans but also contributes to a sustainable future.</p><p>The Vietnamese coffee industry has consistently received recognition and praise from numerous reputable international media outlets for years.</p><p>Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam aims to continue popularising the image of Vietnamese coffee culture and contribute to promoting the country's coffee beans and the coffee industry in the international media. - VNS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69WN-RHY1-DXMS-836W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 18, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSDM</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NW</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F8K</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL INCOME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001315</classCode><className>PESTICIDES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000383</classCode><className>CONSUMPTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

Why did Nestl\\xE9 make the decision and what is the company doing to support and accelerate this transformation?</p><p>We are the world's biggest food company. So it means that we need good quality and sustainable ingredients in order to make sure that at a time when things are going down, we're doing this in the most sensible way that we can. Climate change, of course, is a huge issue for the whole world. And Nestl\\xE9 has promised to be net zero carbon by 2050. One way we do this is by investing in regenerative agriculture which means using practices which are good for the planet, good for the community, and good for the farmers as well, making sure that they've got the livelihoods. So we need to invest in agriculture because when you're a food company, agriculture is incredibly important. So you need a lot of materials in order to make your products.</p><p>What is Nestl\\xE9 doing to help transition to a sustainable food system in Vietnam?</p><p>One of the most important things is helping farmers to move from being farmers to what we call agripreneurs. That means making sure that farms are as productive as possible, so that they have good livelihoods and good income. At the same time making sure that the farming that they do and the practices that they follow are good.</p><p>So we work, for example, in the Central Highlands with coffee farmers in what we call the Nescafe Plan 2030. And we're investing there in practices that will improve carbon and regenerative agriculture. But most of all, we'll make sure that those farmers have great livelihoods. So that they will continue to stay on the land to produce the great quality coffee that they do best.</p><p>Could you share the challenges and opportunities when Nestl\\xE9 applies the regenerative agriculture model - one of the solutions to help transform the food system in Vietnam?</p><p>One of the biggest challenges with asking farmers to maybe change their ideas, change the practices that they've heard from their grandfathers and their fathers, and to do something different to maybe use less fertiliser, maybe to use fewer pesticides, to take on different ways of making the soil health better. It is that you're asking them to take the leap of faith, you're asking them to trust you that really what you are telling them or encouraging them to do is going to be a benefit.</p><p>So one of the things that we do to try to do as much as possible is to create pilot farms so that we can show them how there is a benefit. And the other thing that we do is we train the trainers. So we get groups of 50 to 100 farmers and they elect the farmer leaders and then we train that leader so that they are helping us make sure that the messages make sense.</p><p>The other thing when I've been to the Central Highlands we have an army of economists who are the heroes really, we're helping to work with this. Often these agronomists are coming from the farming families themselves. So they really know that we work with farm workers to make all things make sense.</p><p>What are the potential and advantages of Vietnam's agricultural sector in transitioning to a sustainable food system and becoming a regional food innovation hub?</p><p>What this is really all about, is making sure farming is a good profession to join. You know that if you inherit your family farm, it makes sense for you and your family to stay on the land. So the more that we can help with improving the productivity of farms in a regenerative way, meaning a way that is good for the soil, good for the planet, then you're going to have a double benefit. You're going to have a benefit to that farmer, because you're going to have a more productive enterprise a more productive farm. But most importantly, these are efforts that are going to be good for the planet. We're facing a climate emergency. And it's really important that we play our role as the world's biggest food company, in helping agriculture to change and transform itself and become stronger so that we can make a difference and we can deal with the climate emergency.</p><p>What are Nestl\\xE9's expectations and the key message that the company wants to deliver to the side event?</p><p>Nestle is committed to being net zero by 2050, meaning that we want to reduce our carbon. Now, one way to do this is to encourage farmers to take the best way of doing things in conventional agriculture, but to combine it with regenerative agriculture. So what we do today is to really encourage farmers to develop regenerative agriculture techniques, which will be good for us and the planet. - VOV</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:684D-MXV1-JB5P-J460-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 1, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Their focus is to grow healthy, tasty food while developing future-oriented cultivation methods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They follow the principles of regenerative agriculture, which goes beyond organic farming.</p><p>The aim of regenerative agriculture is to rebuild the soil's organic matter and restore degraded soil biodiversity - this also results in carbon drawdown, reducing the carbon footprint of agriculture, and improving the natural water cycle.</p><p>It's an urgent issue because healthy soil is seriously in danger.</p><p>A shocking 90 per cent of the Earth's valuable topsoil is likely to be at risk by 2050, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p><p>Regenerative agriculture and the importance of soil</p><p>Healthy soil and a diverse range of species in the environment can offer plants optimal living conditions and help produce nutrient-rich food.</p><p>But healthy soil requires topsoil, the upper layer of earth which contains 'humus'.</p><p>Humus is the term in soil science for the dark organic material which is made from decomposing plant and animal matter. It is the nutrient-rich matter that is vital for successful agriculture, and according to the FAO around 95% of the world's food is grown in just a few centimetres of this soil.</p><p>Yet around the world, healthy topsoil is currently being destroyed through intensive farming practices, erosion and chemical pollution.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture aims to not only 'not harm' the land but actually to enrich and regenerate the soil.</p><p>Different techniques and technologies are used to achieve this, including increased crop diversity, crop rotation, composting, pasture cropping, and minimised tillage.</p><p>The focus on food production is really in the environment or directly in the soil, explains Sam. So the soil continues being fertile and the hydrological balance of the soil isn't altered, which has an impact on the entire hydrological balance of the planet.\"</p><p>Putting it simply, after harvesting our crops, the soil is better than before sowing!</p><p>\"Our take on regenerative agriculture is that it is multifunctional, explains Matthias. \"Which means that the soil is improving. Not only the humus (organic matter) but the structure. The structure of the roots needs to improve. At the same time, fertilisers and irrigation should not be necessary, at least not in Switzerland.\"</p><p>Matthias and Sam believe, contrary to popular opinion, that regenerative agriculture is doable on a big scale. Part of their SlowGrow mission is to demonstrate this by sharing their findings, knowledge and tools between farms.</p><p>Innovation on the farm</p><p>As a trained aerospace engineer, Matthias loves to experiment. They use their land as a living lab to test machines and techniques.</p><p>Matthias and Sam have realised that many current equipment and technologies used in agriculture are just not built to manage and preserve the soil's organic material. The machines either don't work or get clogged.</p><p>To overcome this kind of problem, they dedicate a part of their farm's resources to innovation.</p><p>We are experimenting with machines. To do what we do by hand here, with machines. In other words, to try to spread the topsoil by using a machine and to cover the land organically. That's what our department of development does. It researches how to manage large quantities of organic material.\"</p><p>The young farmers say that their project is only possible because there are other people, like them, who are interested in exploring alternatives in agriculture, and there are enough clients ready to pay for high-quality, organic products.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66X3-PJT1-DXMS-82GB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No one in the industry has seen anything like it.</p><p>To those of us in the regenerative agriculture movement, this story is not a surprise, but rather the inevitable result of our industrial-intensive food system.</p><p>It goes like this. In the 1990s, olive farmers realised they could boost yields and cut production costs by ripping out century-old rain-fed, organic olive plantations and replanting them with dense rows.</p><p>The land couldn't support this massive increase in nutrient and water demand, but this didn't matter; artificial fertilizer would provide the nutrients, and local aquifers the irrigation.</p><p>Competition from weeds? Spray herbicide. Monocultures that attract pests? More spraying.</p><p>These extra costs were more than made up for by getting rid of people. Stumpy, bushy tree rows could be sprayed, trimmed, and harvested by vastly cheaper machines.</p><p>We got cheaper olive oil, but at what price?</p><p>Encouraged by agronomists and academic research, so-called super high density cultivation spread across Spain and took root in Andalucia. It now accounts for almost half of global EVOO production.</p><p>We got cheaper olive oil. But the Spanish countryside was emptied of people. Water tables collapsed, with chemical runoff poisoning the water that was left.</p><p>Grasses, shrubs and soil were replaced by bare, hard-packed dirt surrounding kilometres-long rows of trees, raising ground temperatures and eradicating animal, insect, and bird life. It even stopped raining, making the drought even worse.</p><p>Cue global heating in this fragile, abused ecosystem. Temperatures in Spain of 40C in early 2022 disrupted the olive flowering and ruined the 2022-2023 harvest. Unprecedented water shortages in 2023 ruined the current one.</p><p>We've never seen two failed harvests in a row; global reserves have been used up. Should there be a third failure, the industry consequences could be devastating.</p><p>So now we have an industry in a crisis of its own making. In Spain, the domestic EVOO market dropped 40% in 2023 - given the importance of olive oil to Spanish food that's as if British people cut tea consumption in half.</p><p>A healthier approach exists - and it would be worth it</p><p>But there's still hope. The mission of companies like Amfora is to connect customers directly to smaller farms that use regenerative agriculture to protect soil, encourage biodiversity, and revive rural communities.</p><p>We're not trying to feed the world, just bring traceability and sustainability to a screwed-up industry. We can't go back in time, either; high-density farms aren't going to go away. We need their output to meet global demand. EVOO shouldn't just be a product for the rich.</p><p>For sure, these intensive farms can never be as sustainable or regenerative as our farmers are, but they can borrow their ideas: replace bare ground between trees with vegetation, ease off on the chemicals, and encourage soil life and life above ground.</p><p>Climate change won't go away, but the EVOO industry will be less vulnerable to it.</p><p>Just covering ground with grass and shrubs can lower ground temperatures and allow the soil to retain water much better.</p><p>There's a chance it could even bring back some local rainfall. These changes are already being encouraged by local governments and the EU, but they also need a mental shift from the growers, the industry, and the consumer.</p><p>Farmers might have to give up a bit of yield at first - but that's better than going without any product at all.</p><p>Creating resilient supply through targeted regeneration is the best way to overcome the fraud problem in the future, but the environmental benefits, potentially reviving whole ecosystems in Andalucia and southern Spain, could be much more important.</p><p>Let's not waste this crisis.</p><p>Eurof Uppington is the CEO and Founder of Amfora, a Switzerland-based importer of extra virgin olive oils.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5J-RX71-JB5P-J0H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 24, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000261Y</classCode><className>SYNGENTA AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS424910 FARM SUPPLIES MERCHANT WHOLESALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS325320 PESTICIDE &amp;

These past four years, the Administration has created a bold new playbook that has turned tackling the climate crisis into an enormous economic opportunity - both at home and abroad. After spearheading the most significant domestic climate and conservation action in history and leading global efforts to tackle the climate crisis, today President Biden is traveling to Manaus, Brazil, where he will meet with Indigenous and other leaders and become the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Amazon rainforest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President has leveraged our Nation's leadership on domestic climate and conservation action to help accelerate global efforts to combat and reverse deforestation and deploy nature-based solutions that reduce emissions, enhance biodiversity, and build resilience to a changing climate. As part of advancing this ambitious climate and conservation agenda, the Administration is investing in Amazon conservation efforts, sustainable land management, and wildfire prevention, while also strengthening our Nation's collaboration with Brazil, support for Indigenous communities, and efforts to combat illegal deforestation in the Amazon and around the world.</p><p>Today, as part of his historic trip to the Amazon, President Biden will announce that the United States has fulfilled his historic pledge to increase U.S. international climate finance to over $11 billion a year by 2024 - making the United States the largest bilateral provider of climate finance in the world. This represents a more than six-fold increase from the $1.5 billion in climate finance the U.S. provided in FY21, underscoring the success of President Biden's whole-of-government effort to scaling-up U.S. climate finance over the last four years. This also includes achieving for the second year in a row his pledge to scale-up U.S. adaptation finance six-fold to over $3 billion per year to help vulnerable countries around the world build resilience to the impacts of climate change, as part of implementing the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE). This also included achieving record-levels of climate investments through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and U.S. Export Import Bank (EXIM) - with DFC reaching $3.71 billion in FY24 and EXIM increasing its investments to a record $1.6 billion in FY24.</p><p>President Biden will also sign a U.S. proclamation designating November 17th as International Conservation Day. The proclamation recognizes that conservation is critical to protecting the livelihoods of the people who depend on our world's natural wonders, conserving our ecosystems and wildlife, ensuring our lands and waters can be enjoyed for generations to come, and helping avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p>Central to today's trip is President Biden's commitment to conserving our forests and combatting global deforestation. Over the past four years, the Administration has led efforts to conserve more than 45 million acres of lands and waters; safeguard mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands here at home; strengthen reforestation partnerships across the country to support local economies; combat global deforestation; and deploy nature-based solutions that reduce emissions, enhance biodiversity, and build resilience in the face of increasing climate threats. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new efforts to accelerate global action to conserve lands and waters, protect biodiversity, and tackle the climate crisis, including:</p><p>Announcing $50 Million for the Amazon Fund. The United States is announcing $50 million for the Amazon Fund, which will bring U.S. total contributions to the Amazon Fund to $100 million, subject to Congressional notification.</p><p>Launching the Brazil Restoration &amp; Bioeconomy Finance Coalition. The United States, BTG Pactual, and over 12 partners are announcing the launch of the Brazil Restoration and Bioeconomy Finance Coalition. This Coalition intends to mobilize at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and bioeconomy-related projects by 2030, supporting the conservation and restoration of at least 5.5 million hectares during this period, and contributing to 1.5 gigatons of emissions reductions and removals through 2050. At least $500 million is expected to be invested in projects that support Indigenous peoples and local communities in the Brazilian Amazon.</p><p>Announcing a New DFC Investment in the Largest Reforestation Projects in the Amazon. DFC is providing a $37.5 million loan to Mombak Gestora de Recursos Ltda., to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil, which will sequester carbon and enable biodiversity conservation. Mombak has designed an innovative and large-scale approach to generating high-quality Verified Emission Reduction (VER) credits by acquiring large tracts of degraded grassland in the Brazilian state of Par\\xE1 and surrounding regions, which it will plant with native tree species. This activity is expected to sequester approximately 5 million metric tons of CO2 over 50 years while preserving biodiversity in the Amazon region.</p><p>Announcing Support for the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. The United States today announced its support for President Lula's bold vision of creating the TFFF - a pathbreaking new $125 billion fund that reflects both the urgency and the scale of the challenge of conserving the world's most important forests. TFFF will attract substantial private capital and make a meaningful contribution to tropical forest conservation. The United States is announcing support to help finalize the necessary technical and analytical work needed to design and setup the Facility.</p><p>These announcements supplement additional efforts the United States is taking to support climate resilience and biodiversity in critical ecosystems like the Amazon and others around the world, including:</p><p>Scaling Finance to Restore and Conserve These Important Landscapes</p><p>Leveraging Demand for High-Integrity Forest Carbon Credits. The Lowering Emissions through Advancing Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, co-founded by the United States as a coalition of private sector and government buyers, recently announced a $180 million agreement on high-integrity forest carbon credits with the Brazilian state of Par\\xE1. Revenues from the transaction of credits generated at the scale of the entire state, at the pathbreaking price of $15/tonne of avoided emissions, will support the conservation of the Amazon Rainforest. The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon. Next steps include full consultations with stakeholders, program validation and verification of results under the ART-TREES standard. Agreements with additional Amazon region states are expected in the coming months, starting with Acre, with significant demand-side interest for high-integrity credits from Brazilian states.</p><p>New Cooperation Framework Agreement Between DFC and BNDES. Last month, DFC and Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ\\xF4mico e Social (BNDES), the Brazilian Development Bank, signed a cooperation framework agreement to enhance and deepen co-investment opportunities in Brazil in climate-related sectors. This new partnership hopes to expand support for conservation and restoration investments at scale in the Amazon's arch of reforestation and other important biodiversity-rich biomes.</p><p>Launching a Nature-Based Solutions Investment Lab. Instituto Itausa, BB Asset, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Instituto Clima e Sociedade are partnering with USAID to structure a nature-based solutions (NbS) Investment Lab with $2 million from USAID. The lab will foster an enabling environment to unlock private investment in NbS projects by creating interaction and collaboration among different sources of funds, sources of capital, and NbS stakeholders to create innovative financial instruments and transactions; identifying and designing appropriate business models, standardized projects and assessment of impacts of NbS projects in Brazil; and addressing regulatory challenges and advocate for policy enhancements.</p><p>Launching Alliances for the Amazon. This initiative will build on an existing partnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) that created a collective action platform to join private sector and civil society organizations to develop and identify innovative solutions for sustainable development and conservation of the Brazilian Amazon. In its prior phase with USAID support, the Partnership accelerated 123 biodiversity-supportive businesses, leveraged $7.5 million in private funding, and supported conservation of 39 million hectares. The new AFA partnership will expand USAID-CIAT's ground-breaking TerraBio scientific methodology for measuring biodiversity impact for Amazon-based impact investment projects.</p><p>USAID will Provide $2.6 Million to the Rainforest Wealth Project, led by IMAFLORA in collaboration with Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), which seeks to establish scalable economic models to conserve standing forests, meet legal requirements, enhance local community welfare, and achieve responsible market standards. The project aims to expand the Origens Brasil network to facilitate fair trade for community-produced goods, increasing corporate participation and commitment within the network. It also focuses on strengthening the value chains for non-timber forest products and promoting agroecology among family farmers, traditional communities, settlers, and quilombolas across northern and southeastern Par\\xE1, bringing them into the Origens Brasil network.</p><p>Building the Bioeconomy</p><p>Announcing $4 million to Support New Business Models that Keep Forests Standing While Benefitting Local Businesses and Families. USAID is announcing $4 million to support a program that it is codesigning with local organization Conexsus to strengthen the bioeconomy business ecosystems in the Brazilian Amazon, bolstering a new economic model that keeps the forest standing and aligns biodiversity conservation with economic growth for local businesses and families to thrive. This initiative builds on a Memorandum of Understanding signed last March between the Skoll Foundation and USAID that recognized their shared commitment to advance locally led development and expand coordination to address deforestation issues and promote gender equality globally.</p><p>USAID is Investing $1.4 Million in Assobio: The Call for Socio-Biodiversity. This project will strengthen bioeconomy value chains that hold potential for forest and biodiversity conservation while increasing income generation and addressing food security in the state of Mato Grosso. The project's aim is to strengthen a thriving forest-based economy by creating new public-private arrangements that attract financing and promoting diversified strategies to support regenerative land management, entrepreneurial knowledge, and access to financial resources and markets for family farming and Indigenous people in Mato Grosso's Amazon region. This will significantly contribute to the conservation of approximately one-third of the forest in Mato Grosso, an area of 8.9 million hectares.</p><p>Supporting Low-Carbon, Climate-Resilient Supply Chains</p><p>USAID is Investing $2.8 Million in the Regenerative Agriculture for the Conservation of the Amazon (ARCA) Activity. The ARCA program promotes nature-based solutions and restoration in buffer zones around conservation units, Indigenous lands, quilombolas, and land reform settlements in seven territories in three of Brazil's Amazonian states-Mato Grosso, Maranh\\xE3o, and Par\\xE1, all of which are located in the Brazilian Amazon's Arc of Deforestation. ARCA's aim is to promote sustainable land use, biodiversity conservation, and the socio-environmental resilience of traditional communities through capacity building, collaboration, and innovation. ARCA aims to help improve the management of more than 19 million hectares of land in the Amazon, working with 40 Indigenous Territories and Quilombola Areas.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is Supporting Efforts to Improve Fertilizer Efficiency.USDA has partnered with Brazilian and U.S. institutions on a groundbreaking joint research project to improve fertilizer efficiency, with the goal of combatting climate change and food insecurity. The project, called Fertilize for Life, currently funded at $1.2 million is part of USDA's Fertilize Right Initiative, launched in 2023 with support from the U.S. Department of State's Global Fertilizer Challenge, and focuses on enabling cooperation on more efficient, climate-friendly land use has significant potential to scale sustainable agriculture, improve productivity and farmers' livelihoods, while reducing nitrous oxide emissions.</p><p>The Department of State, through a $2.5 million award to the Nature Conservancy (TNC), is supporting efforts to reduce deforestation associated with the Brazilian cattle sector by improving traceability of cattle throughout the entire supply chain. These interventions aim to support the cattle industry in avoiding 400 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year from deforestation and habitat loss, alongside reductions in methane emissions. This effort is anchored in the State of Para, which has set a goal of achieving full cattle traceability by 2025.</p><p>Leveraging Technology to Support Forest Conservation and Management</p><p>Partnering with the Government of Brazil to Combat Illegal Logging and Associated Trade. The U.S. is cooperating to ensure Brazil possesses state-of-the-art technology and operational capacity for timber identification via Mass Spectrometry (DART-TOFMS: Direct Analysis in Real Time Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry). This technology identifies a unique chemical fingerprint to identify wood species, strengthening capacity to monitor and enforce legality in timber supply chains.</p><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is Supporting Near Real-Time Burn Area Mapping Efforts to the Remote Sensing Laboratory at Rio de Janeiro Federal University, providing key satellite observations used by Sistema Alarmes. The system generates daily burned area mapping updates for major endangered biomes in Brazil, helping inform decision making at the Brazilian Ministry for the Environment and Climate Change. For more than 15 years NOAA has also supported the satellite-based wildfire monitoring program at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research. That program provides critical near real-time fire detection information for most of South America using a suite of satellite datasets.</p><p>USAID is Investing $7.8 million in its Longstanding Partnership with the U.S. Forest Service to Strengthen Brazilian Fire Management. USAID and the U.S. Forest Service support Brazilian agencies with wildfire prevention and response. Standardized fire curricula ensure all firefighters share a common language and standardized approaches like the Incident Command System. USFS promotes inclusive fire management, training women and Indigenous communities, including the first-ever all-women Indigenous fire brigade in Tocantins and Maranh\\xE3o.</p><p>Delivering for Local and Indigenous Communities</p><p>USAID is Investing $1.9 Million to Launch the Alliance of Indigenous Peoples for the Forests of the Eastern Amazon. This alliance will bring together organizations representing Indigenous people to conserve, protect, and restore natural resources in 14 Indigenous territories in Maranh\\xE3o and Tocantins states. The project will cover a total combined area of approximately 2.5 million hectares of land that is home to a population of roughly 35,000 individuals from 11 ethnic groups, as well as a group in voluntary isolation.</p><p>Expanding Support for Existing U.S. Programs Including the Indigenous Peoples Finance Access Facility (IPFAF). This project aims to increase access to financing for Indigenous communities for forest conservation, restoration, and management with a focus on Indigenous peoples in the Amazon basin, as well as the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia. IPFAF is also working to enhance the capacity of Indigenous peoples and their representative organizations to protect and sustainably manage natural resources in 27 million hectares of forested landscapes of southern Amazonas state, and across savannah and forested landscapes of Roraima state.</p><p>USAID Is Investing $4 Million to Launch the Tapaj\\xF3s for Life Activity, which aims to reduce threats to Amazon biodiversity by improving sustainable use and conservation of 7 million hectares of protected areas and Indigenous peoples' lands and local communities' lands in the Tapaj\\xF3s river basin. It will expand the sustainable value chains for forest products, support community-based tourism, and improve territorial management within the river basin.</p><p>USAID will Invest $1.4 Million to Launch the Well-Being and Territorial Management in the Rio Negro and Xingu River Basins Project. This activity seeks to strengthen the capacity of Indigenous peoples of the Xingu and Rio Negro River basins-and their networks of partnerships-to implement Brazil's National Policy for the Territorial and Environmental Management of Indigenous Lands (PNGATI) and its management instruments, such as the Territorial and Environmental Management Plans. Strengthening the environmental management of these Indigenous territories in the Rio Negro and Xingu basins could help sustainably manage approximately 26 million hectares of land that are strategically important for the conservation of biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon.</p><p>USAID is investing $2.6 million to launch the Integrated Indigenous Territorial Management activity, which will support Indigenous representative organizations to develop territorial and environmental management plans that incorporate policy advocacy on Indigenous lands, enhancing the capacity of Indigenous peoples and their representative organizations to protect and sustainably manage natural resources in a total combined area of 27 million hectares in forested landscapes of southern Amazonas state, and across the savannah and forested landscapes of Roraima state.</p><p>Leveraging U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Partnerships</p><p>Launching Zero Carbon Advanced Energy Systems in the Amazon. The U.S. Department of Energy will execute an assessment of renewable mini-grid deployment in the Legal Amazon region with the goal of supporting Brazil's Energies of the Amazon Program.

Canada is among the top countries for sales of organic food products in the global market. Standardizing practices and substances that can be labelled as organic is vitally important for Canada to remain competitive in global trade. Regulations also ensure that imported products labelled as organic are complying with Canadian standards, to protect Canadian consumers.</p><p>Today, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, announced $502,374 to the Organic Federation of Canada (OFC) to update the standards regulating the production and marketing of certified organic products. This funding is provided through the AgriAssurance Program - National Industry Association Component, an initiative under the Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership.</p><p>In consultation with the organic sector, the OFC will update the Canadian Organic Standards to add new practices and permitted substances and revise the sections on animal welfare. The OFC project will focus on innovative, sustainable and ecological organic practices that can reduce the impact of climate change by capturing and storing carbon in soil and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The OFC will also explore regenerative agriculture practices such as vertical agriculture and sunless crops, which will have positive long-term effects for the sector.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>With this investment, we're helping facilitate more trade opportunities for Canadian organic producers and keeping pace with the latest practices. These standards are an important tool to help the industry so they can keep meeting the needs of folks here in Canada, and around the world.</p><p>- The Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</p><p>Farmers are proud to apply the Canadian Organic Standards, which are based on principles shared with international markets. These standards are being updated to clarify all the practices and substances that are applied at every stage of organic food production and processing. This will help maintain growth in the Canadian organic market.</p><p>- Jim Robbins, President of the Organic Federation of Canada and field crop producer in Saskatchewan</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>- The AgriAssurance Program - National Industry Association Component, under the Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership, funds national-level projects to help industry develop, verify and integrate assurance systems to address market and regulatory requirements and to enable industry to make credible, meaningful and verifiable claims about the health, safety and quality of Canadian agriculture products.</p><p>- The application intake period for the AgriAssurance Program is open.</p><p>- The Organic Federation of Canada (OFC) is a national organization responsible for the maintenance and interpretation of the Canadian Organic Standards and the administration of scientific research in organic agriculture in Canada.</p><p>- The OFC has successfully administered the revision of the Canadian Organic Standards since 2015. Updates take place every 5 years.</p><p>- The Canadian Organic Standards are a detailed set of principles, guidelines, and permitted substances that are used in the organic certification process. The standards prohibit the use of any genetic engineering or gene edited material in crop and livestock production.</p><p>- The scope of the Canadian Organic Standards includes field crops, honey, maple sugar, sprouts, horticulture, greenhouse crops, livestock (dairy, poultry, pig, sheep and goats), and processed food.</p><p>Source: Government of Canada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BFN-Y3F1-JB5P-J45S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 4, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Business &amp;

Due to the rashes, she had to take steroids for years. Her unusual condition triggered an interest in macrobiotic foods and later organic food. Although she was careful with her diet, she still had rashes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2016, Pavida had to call an ambulance because she experienced vertigo and low blood pressure. Although test results for her lung and heart were normal, she believed that something was wrong. When someone recommended she take a food intolerance test, Pavida followed the advice.</p><p>As a result of the test, Pavida discovered she suffers from food intolerance which causes a physical reaction. These foods include normal items such as oranges, guavas, egg whites, kimchi, kombucha, ice cream, bread and pizza. The list of items she is intolerant of includes yeast, which makes her avoid seasoning in her diet. The doctor advised Pavida to replace manufactured seasoning with natural ingredients such as lemon, salt, and natural sugar instead of refined sugar.</p><p>The doctor told her that eating foods with a short shelf life helps people have a longer lifespan, while eating foods with a long shelf life leads to a shorter lifespan.</p><p>'Natural food cannot last long. The doctor told me that if I wanted to recover, I had to eat freshly cooked food.'</p><p>The food intolerance test results indicated that Pavida could drink organic coconut water, which happened to be her favourite beverage. She drank it often and established a connection with the owner of some organic coconut farms. During a visit to one of these farms, she was surprised to see a pile of leftover coconuts.</p><p>'Coconuts aged six months and one week sell well since the coconut is soft and the water is sweet. However, coconuts that are six months and two weeks old are too hard, so farmers keep only the coconut water and throw away the shells. I wanted to find a use for the leftover coconut, so I asked the doctor if I could make yoghurt with coconut to consume myself, and the doctor encouraged me to do so.'</p><p>After consulting her doctor and receiving a list of probiotic bacteria in the Bifidobacterium group, Pavida chose six strains listed in Announcement No.346 of the Ministry of Public Health. She made a homemade probiotic fermented coconut yoghurt called Bicogurt from the leftover coconuts, coconut water, coconut sugar and six chosen probiotic bacteria. The yoghurt is available in three formulas - Strong, which boosts the immune system; In The Mood, which improves the neurotransmitter and anti-inflammatory system; and Vegan Lemon Curd, which is a probiotic coconut dessert.</p><p>The story of Bicogurt and how to use leftover coconuts is displayed at Thailand Creative  and  Design Center (TCDC) as part of the 'Waste To Health Showcase', which was originally presented at Bangkok Design Week (BKKDW) in February. The first exhibition was a bit different from the current showcase as it offered samples of Bicogurt. Pavida said many people became customers after BKKDW.</p><p>'My goal is to show visitors that there are many ways to manage food waste. You do not have to be a manufacturer to handle food waste. Any ordinary person can do this. There is an abundance of information about organic food sources. I decided to exhibit at 'Waste To Health Showcase' at TCDC because I believe that visitors who come to TCDC are my target customers. The details of making Bicogurt takes time to understand and visitors at TCDC can learn about it, making the exhibition useful for them,' explained Pavida.</p><p>In addition to promoting managing food waste, Pavida added information about regenerative agriculture. She explained that regenerative agriculture is important because many studies abroad have found that nutrition in today's rice is lower than in the past due to unhealthy soil. Therefore, it is necessary to regenerate the soil.</p><p>'Regenerative agriculture is related to the circular economy since farmers use leftover products like coconut husk to cover the top of the soil. This helps to retain moisture in the soil. Charcoal from coconut shells is mixed with soil to improve its quality, increase airflow and retain moisture. If the soil becomes fertile, fungi, bacteria, worms, Glomerida and other small creatures can live in the soil. These creatures help to improve the ecosystem. Regenerative agriculture takes time to establish, but once the system is in place, farmers will spend less than on chemical farming,' Pavida said.</p><p>Bicogurt does not only help Pavida improve her health and earn money, it also helps farmers to earn an income of over 50,000 baht a year from leftover coconuts. In the past, the farmers lost space of 200m\u00b2 each year as dumping grounds for leftover coconuts. After working with Pavida since June 2020, the farmers do not have to waste any space on the farm.</p><p>'Since there are no more leftover coconuts, we were able to cut 125kg of methane gas per year. Although farmers initially said 125kg is not much, we should help the environment as much as we can. Now, farmers understand the importance of reducing greenhouse gas,' said Pavida.</p><p>In order to use more leftover coconuts, Pavida has created additional products. She worked with a chef to create a plant-based dish, Calamari Never Dies, which uses thick coconut meat as a substitute for calamari. Pavida said the recipe will provide healthy fat and fibre with fewer calories and tastes similar to calamari. She also created recipes for organic sauces and organised a taste-testing event at TCDC Common last Sunday.</p><p>'I believe organic sauces are blue ocean products. I hope that the recipes will reach local communities. It is exciting to see sauces made from local ingredients so that consumers will have more choices,' she said.</p><p>After two years of Bicogurt, positive feedback makes Pavida proud. One of the most impressive cases was Ann, who suffered from bad breath for a decade. Ann was told that incomplete defecation caused toxins to accumulate in the intestines. Ann had consulted medical doctors and traditional Chinese and Thai doctors, but her bad breath could not be cured. After she took Bicogurt daily for three months, it helped her bad breath disappear.</p><p>Pavida said: 'I am proud to provide knowledge I gained from my sickness. I felt like paying it forward since I received information about the doctor and food intolerance test from someone else. I then created Bicogurt which became a business and solved the problem of leftover coconuts for farmers. I am happy to help people improve their bowel movements and people who have cancer can now enjoy vegan lemon curd as dessert since some of them were advised to not consume refined sugar. It is nice to bring food waste into food production as well as to improve the environment in farms and reduce methane gas.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG24052023000545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689N-XP51-F00C-60V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24135\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 24, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CY76</classCode><className>FOOD INTOLERANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001227</classCode><className>NUTRITION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001265</classCode><className>ORGANIC FOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000156</classCode><className>BACTERIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A0KR</classCode><className>MEAT FREE DIETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001265</classCode><className>ORGANIC FOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000916W</classCode><className>FUNCTIONAL FOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp;

Here's a closer look at some of the countries in the region that are currently standing out in terms of investment potential.</p><p>Indonesia, the largest economy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), is a standout for its significant economic size and growth trajectory. With a GDP that accounted for more than one-third of the ASEAN member nations' combined GDP in 2020, Indonesia's market is robust and diverse, offering opportunities in various sectors, from manufacturing to digital services.</p><p>Thailand, the second-largest ASEAN economy, has shown resilience and growth in several industries, including automotive, electronics, and agriculture. The country's strategic location and developed infrastructure make it an attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).</p><p>Malaysia has been a consistent performer in attracting FDI, thanks to its stable political environment, well-developed infrastructure, and skilled workforce. The country's focus on high-technology industries and a growing digital economy has made it a top choice for investors looking at Southeast Asia.</p><p>Singapore, though small in size, is a global financial hub with a highly developed and successful free-market economy. It has a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries.</p><p>Vietnam is another emerging star in the region, with its rapidly growing economy, ongoing reforms, and commitment to liberalizing its economy. The country has become a manufacturing hub for electronics and textiles, with FDI inflows hitting record highs.</p><p>The Philippines, with its large and young population, is also gaining attention as an investment destination, particularly in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector and remittances-driven domestic consumption.</p><p>Each of these countries offers distinct advantages and challenges, and the key to successful investment lies in understanding the local market dynamics, regulatory environments, and cultural nuances. Investors are advised to conduct comprehensive due diligence and consider partnering with local entities to navigate the complexities of the Southeast Asian market effectively.</p><p>For a more detailed analysis of the investment opportunities in these countries, accessing comprehensive market research reports and economic overviews can provide deeper insights and strategic guidance.</p><p>Southeast Asia's High Growth Potential Sectors: A Comprehensive Overview<br/></p><p>Southeast Asia is a region of immense economic potential, with several sectors poised for significant growth. Drawing from recent market analyses and forecasts, here's an exploration of the sectors that are expected to drive the region's economy forward.</p><p>E-commerce stands out as one of the most explosive sectors in Southeast Asia. With a projected growth of 261% between 2016 and 2021, the digital marketplace is thriving, fueled by increasing internet penetration and a young, tech-savvy population. This sector's expansion is supported by the rise of local giants as well as the entry of global players, making it a highly competitive and innovative space.</p><p>Digital financial services are also on the rise, as fintech companies are revolutionizing the way consumers access financial products. From mobile payments to digital banking, Southeast Asia is embracing these services, which cater to its large unbanked population and growing middle class.</p><p>The online travel sector is another area with high growth potential. As the region's middle class expands and disposable incomes rise, more people are traveling for leisure and business. This has spurred growth in online booking platforms and travel-related services, catering to a more connected and mobile population.</p><p>Digital entertainment, including streaming services and online gaming, is rapidly gaining traction. With one of the world's youngest populations, Southeast Asia is a prime market for digital content providers. The region's consumers are increasingly turning to digital platforms for entertainment, making it a promising sector for investment.</p><p>Agriculture technology (agritech) and biotechnology are sectors where innovation is ripe, with startups and established companies alike exploring ways to increase efficiency and productivity in the region's vital agricultural sector.</p><p>Cybersecurity is another critical sector, as the digital transformation of economies heightens the need for robust security solutions. Southeast Asia, with its growing digital infrastructure, is becoming a significant market for cybersecurity products and services.</p><p>Renewable energy and sustainable technologies are also key growth areas, as the region seeks to balance economic development with environmental sustainability. Investments in green technologies, such as solar and wind power, are expected to increase, driven by government incentives and a global shift towards cleaner energy sources.</p><p>Accessing Investment Opportunities in Southeast Asia's Renewable Energy Sector</p><p>Southeast Asia is rapidly becoming a focal point for renewable energy investments, with a growing emphasis on sustainable development. For investors looking to enter this vibrant market, there are several pathways to consider.</p><p>Firstly, understanding the regional landscape is crucial. The ASEAN region is actively seeking to scale up investment in renewable power to meet sustainability goals. However, the development of renewable power is currently hindered by inadequate policy and investment frameworks. To overcome these challenges, decision-makers are prioritizing the attraction of lower-cost capital from international investors.</p><p>Investors can look into various opportunities such as renewable power projects, transmission infrastructure, biofuels, energy efficiency initiatives, hydrogen production, and electromobility. These sectors are expected to require over USD 6 trillion in cumulative investments by 2050, offering substantial long-term prospects.</p><p>To access these opportunities, investors can engage in several strategies:</p><p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Many Southeast Asian governments encourage PPPs to facilitate infrastructure development, including renewable energy projects. Investors can collaborate with local governments to finance and manage these projects.<br/>Green Bonds and Funds: Green bonds are a growing trend in the region, providing a way to invest in environmentally friendly projects. Additionally, several green funds are dedicated to renewable energy investments in Southeast Asia.<br/>Direct Investment: Investors can directly fund renewable energy startups or established companies looking to expand their operations. This can be done through equity investments or venture capital funding.<br/>International and Regional Development Banks: Organizations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) support renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia. Investors can participate in these projects through co-financing opportunities or by engaging in programs designed to facilitate private investment.<br/>Market Research and Networking: Staying informed through market research reports and engaging with industry networks can provide insights into emerging opportunities and connect investors with potential projects.<br/>Government Incentives: Many Southeast Asian countries offer incentives for renewable energy investments, such as tax breaks, feed-in tariffs, and grants. Investors should explore these incentives to enhance the viability of their investments.</p><p>Southeast Asia presents a diverse array of investment opportunities across various high-growth sectors. From digital marketplaces to sustainable technologies, the region is at the forefront of economic innovation. Investors looking to capitalize on these trends will find a dynamic environment ripe for strategic investments. For those interested in exploring these sectors further, detailed market research and analysis can provide deeper insights and help identify specific opportunities within each country.</p><p>It's important for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and consider the political, economic, and regulatory environments of each country. Partnering with local entities and consulting with legal and financial experts can also help navigate the complexities of the Southeast Asian renewable energy sector.</p><p>About the author  <br/>About the author<br/><br/>Related Posts<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thailand-business-news.com/author/ntrang\"/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thailand-business-news.com/author/ntrang\">Nguyen Trang</url></p><p>Nguyen Trang is a journalist based in Hanoi, Vietnam.

In addition, Nestl\\xE9 is also the largest coffee purchasing company with total annual purchasing from Vietnam reaching up to $700 million.</p><p>Sharing about this investment, Binu Jacob, General Director of Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam, said: The project is a testament to Nestl\\xE9's long-term investment commitment in Vietnam. It is expected that when the project comes into operation, the factory's capacity will be double, meeting the domestic market's consumer demand and effectively exploiting the export potential, making Vietnam a supply centre for high quality coffee to the world. At the same time, through this project, we also hope to create many job opportunities and continue to expand long-term investment activities in Vietnam, contributing to the sustainable economic development and prosperity of the country.\"</p><p>Sustainable coffee production is one of Nestl\\xE9's important directions in Vietnam. In addition to investing in production technology, Nestl\\xE9 Tr An factory is always a pioneer in sustainable development through the use of clean energy, biomass energy, and application of circular economy in waste management and water resource conservation.</p><p>Accordingly, each year Nestl\\xE9 Tr An factory can reduce CO2 emissions from coffee processing by more than 14,000 tonnes. In addition, all coffee grounds after production are reused by the factory as biomass raw materials. Wastewater from the coffee production process is also treated, recycled and reused in the boiler, helping the factory save more than 112,000 cu.m of water each year.</p><p>In addition, with the desire to contribute to improving the quality of Vietnamese coffee beans, since 2011, Nestl\\xE9 has implemented the NESCAF\\xC9 Plan programme in the Central Highlands region. The programme has also brought positive solutions to sustainably develop the Vietnamese coffee industry from distributing high-quality seedlings, farming according to regenerative agriculture, protecting water resources and biodiversity.</p><p>With a sustainable business strategy, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam not only creates nutritional products, improves the quality of life of Vietnamese people, increases the value of the country's coffee beans, but also aims to protect and regenerate resources for future generations,\" Binu added.</p><p>Nestl\\xE9 Group has invested nearly $830 million through Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam Co Ltd with four factories and two distribution centres. In Dong Nai Province alone, the company is operating three factories, of which Nestl\\xE9 Tr An is one of Nestl\\xE9's largest manufacturing factories in Vietnam. This is also one of the coffee processing factories with the most modern technology in the region. Currently, the factory is producing coffee products with familiar brands including NESCAF\\xC9, NESCAF\\xC9 Dolce Gusto, NESPRESSO, Starbucks and Blue Bottle.</p><p>Operating in Vietnam for nearly three decades, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam Company was honoured to receive certificates of merit from the Prime Minister and many certificates of merit from ministries, including one of largest tax payers to the State budget, reputable exporter and typical enterprise for workers. In December, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam was ranked first in Top Most Sustainable Enterprise in Vietnam in the manufacturing sector by the Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development (VBCSD), voted and announced by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI). This is the third consecutive year the company has been honoured with this title. - VNS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5J-RX71-JB5P-J0D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 24, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Business &amp;

Chookiat Ophaswongse, the association's honorary president, emphasised the importance of developing new rice strains to maintain competitiveness with other exporting nations.</p><p>'This is crucial for the future of Thai rice. Following roadshows and discussions in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, we found they are very concerned about prices. Efforts to reduce costs for farmers, increase yield and develop soft-textured rice varieties that align with market demand are paramount. Other exporting nations have made significant progress in R and D, resulting in rice strains that are competitive with Thai rice.'</p><p>Chookiat also stressed the need for government intervention in developing irrigation systems such as canals and reservoirs, warning that without it, Thai rice exports could decline. He shared insights from a recent meeting with Malaysian wholesalers who expressed concerns over the loss of fragrance of Thai hom mali rice after the initial part of the season.</p><p>In comparison, Vietnam's fragrant rice can be grown multiple times over three months, thus ensuring a consistent supply of aromatic rice. Chookiat advocated for the development of faster-growing Thai rice.</p><p>'The government should avoid market price interference as it could stunt the market. If assistance to farmers is necessary, it should focus on harvest cost subsidies and the development of new rice varieties with cultivation periods of less than 120 days, potentially even 100 days.'</p><p>Nipon Puapongsakorn, a distinguished fellow at Thailand Development Research Institute, echoed the sentiments of avoiding market intervention in terms of pricing. He suggested that if a support policy is needed, Thai rice prices should not be excessively high and the price support should come with certain conditions, reported Bangkok Post.</p><p>'A price guarantee scheme is okay, but it should come with conditions such as requiring participating farmers to take care of the environment through practices such as alternate wet and dry methods because of water scarcity, regenerative agriculture techniques, the adoption of new technology, and avoidance of burning.'</p><p>Nipon challenged the new government to review policies and triple Thai rice farmers' income within three years, acknowledging this could be a difficult task considering the constraints farmers face in adapting to and accepting new technologies.</p><p>'The challenge remains how to effectively accelerate this adoption in less than 10 years, especially for small-scale farmers. Tripling income by increasing yield to 1,000 kg per rai is difficult. In the central region, where the yield is 800 kilograms per rai, increasing it to 1,600 kilograms per rai is difficult because farmers lack new technologies.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHUKET-THAI0209202300001004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHUKET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6938-49H1-JCH9-G413-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461134</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Thaiger All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Thaiger</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 2, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

The main objective of the project is to minimize the negative environmental impacts of Indian Textiles by promoting sustainable practices and mainstreaming knowledge on circular production based practices in the textiles and apparel sectors.</p><p>There are 20 approved strategic research projects in the areas of specialty fibres and geo textiles. Amongst them, 3 projects in the area of Textile waste recycling have also been approved.</p><p>The Apparel Export Promotion Council partnered with Fashion for Goods, Netherlands, also launched a drive on sustainability and circularity to boost the competitiveness of garment exports globally thereby making the textiles sector more efficient.</p><p>Approximately, 50 per cent of the fabric is wasted during the manufacturing process and the fast fashion trends lead to 81% of all manufactured garments getting dumped as landfills either due to short life cycle after consumer use or due to excess stock. The magnitude of waste in landfill which is presumed to be 80% is due to the textiles waste. Yet almost 59% is recycled and reused. The global apparel market size expected to grow from $551.36 billion in 2021 to $605. 4 billion in 2022 is expected to grow to $843.13 billion in 2026, at a growth of 8.6%, stated AEPC.</p><p>India with its core strength on availability of variety of raw material with minimal import dependence leading to short lead times becomes a preferred manufacturing hub for the major international brands and retailers. The country has focused strategy towards encouraging wider penetration of these measures amongst the MSMEs hand holding these units with demonstrations and solutions, sustainability awards, branding efforts etc.</p><p>Besides this, a government initiative is assisting the Indian garment manufacturers to achieve their circularity goals by addressing problem areas including agricultural waste to textile, Chemical recycling of textile, Textile waste, Alternate leather, regenerative agriculture, Wastewater, Plastic recycling and Traceability in the textile supply chain.</p><p>India has a well- networked textiles waste value chain which is organized, enabling transfer of waste across the country.</p><p>Source: DD News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VG-24R1-JB5P-J3NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 3, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is a day that we have been waiting for a long time. Welcome to the 25th Annual Ceremony for the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today, both in person in the historic Benjamin Franklin Reception Room and virtually on our livestream from around the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Award for Corporate Excellence has reached a milestone: 25 years of honoring U.S. companies that create positive impact around the globe. I'm honored to be here with you to recognize six American companies, large and small, for their meaningful contributions to the categories of Innovation to Strengthen Communities, Women's Economic Security, and Climate Resilience. To our six winning companies, I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude and respect. I think everyone would agree that you exemplify the very best of American values in your overseas operations. (Applause.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the world we are facing complex challenges that governments cannot tackle alone, such as climate change, gender inequality, and digital divides. Now more than ever it is critical that we leverage the strength, determination, and innovation of the U.S. business community to reach our shared goals. Your work inspires us all and proves that through public-private partnership and responsible business practices, no task is too daunting.</p><p>And with that, it is my true honor and pleasure to begin the ceremony by welcoming Acting Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs Amy Holman. (Applause.)</p><p>MS HOLMAN: Thank you very much, Sarah, and thank you all for coming today, and congratulations to awardees. It's so much fun to be here today, to be welcoming you all. This is the best day in EB's calendar, and so we're delighted to have you all here to share in the success of our six American companies who exemplify what we try in the Bureau of Business and Economic Affairs to do every day, is to support our U.S. businesses overseas to do good things and to make us all proud here at home.</p><p>So I'm really, really delighted that we're here celebrating our prosperity, part of our work in the bureau. It's also my great delight to welcome our Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell. Kurt is amazing. He's worked all over the government. He's done DOD, he's done the White House, he's been here twice before, and now he's the deputy secretary. And we're so thrilled to have him with all of his experience and all of his great thinking on China. So it's my great pleasure to - and please join me in welcoming the 22nd Deputy Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kurt Campbell. (Applause.)</p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY CAMPBELL: So, guys, this is such - first, to welcome everyone, it's great to see friends, family, everyone. Welcome to the Ben Franklin Room. This is the nicest place at the State Department. We don't all live like this, but we occasionally get to come up here for events. So as you're here, be sure to look out over the venue. It's a lovely day. These days come infrequently in Washington, so enjoy this.</p><p>So this is a true story. A couple of weeks ago - so one of the great things about being the deputy is that you get to step in at the last minute, and so I was meeting this family, and they had told their children how exciting it was they were going to meet the Secretary of State. And so it was the deputy instead, and so one of the daughters was crying hysterically. (Laughter.) So no crying among any of the companies today.</p><p>No, I will tell you those who've not met these companies - and we're going to be introduced to them in a moment - I will tell you they are so inspirational. To see the good that they have done globally in so many different arenas is just really heartwarming.</p><p>I will also say it's exciting for me. I was actually here 25 years ago when the secretary then, Albright, launched these awards. I don't think we would have ever imagined 25 years later the number of companies that we've honored, the work that has been done, the remarkable support that these awards have achieved. So I just - I want to say how grateful we are that you're all here. I'm sorry that it's not the Secretary. I'll do my best. It's not my favorite thing either, like, to just constantly go around disappointing people, but still. (Laughter.) Welcome most warmly to the State Department, okay?</p><p>So I want to thank Acting Secretary Holman - I just say Secretary Holman when - all this acting stuff. I'm grateful to you, as well as Under Secretary Fernandez, who leads the bureau. Special Representative Morgenthau - thank you, Sarah, for everything - and the entire team at the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. And they drive so much of our outreach to the business community. Their dedication to boosting economic opportunities for U.S. companies overseas, promoting workers' rights around the world, and creating jobs back home is what we are all about.</p><p>To our guests - we have guests from Congress and across the federal government, the diplomatic corps, and the private sector - thank you for joining us today and to render honors to these people who have served with such distinction.</p><p>In 1999, Secretary Madeleine Albright established the State Department's Award for Corporate Excellence. It was a recognition that the private sector is probably the essential partner in so much of our diplomatic work, and we see this now more than ever in technology, in all the arenas in which we work. It underscored that when businesses operate by the highest standards - investing in local communities, upholding labor and environmental rights - that's good not only for a company's bottom line but for our partners and for our values and interests.</p><p>Over 25 years, ACE has highlighted more than 70 businesses that epitomize what Secretary Albright called then the genius and generosity of American free enterprise. As global challenges have evolved over the past quarter century, from the climate crisis to cyber threats, the need for robust public-private cooperation has grown exponentially, and the role of industry in addressing these critical issues, whether that's spurring the clean energy transition or training workers for the economy of the future - this has become increasingly important.</p><p>Today we honor our 2024 cohort, six extraordinary companies across three award categories, that are advancing sustainability, equity, and opportunity in the countries where they are operating. And I will say I've met all of them. They are remarkable. You can tell right off the bat that they are making a difference.</p><p>Our first award category is Innovation to Strengthen Communities. In West Africa, Koster Keunen, a 172-year-old Connecticut and Netherlands-based company, has trained nearly 30,000 beekeepers to harvest beeswax, a honey byproduct previously overlooked in the local economy that can be manufactured into products from lip balm to candles. I myself am a beekeeper, so I'm excited by this. I just normally get rid of the beeswax. Now I know what to do. Koster Keunen has also bolstered regional food security in concert with beekeeping practices that prioritize biodiversity and conservation, increased bee productions and pollinations rates, raised the agricultural yields of key crops like mangoes and cashews by as much as 30 percent.</p><p>In Colombia, Microsoft, in collaboration with local educational institutions, NGOs, and telecom companies, has extended high-speed internet to more than 600,000 people in remote parts of the country. You just have to understand what a difference that has made in people's lives. Microsoft has also equipped marginalized communities with digital literacy skills, lifting 10,000 people out of poverty and enabling an estimated 31,000 people to find jobs in the tech economy - again, an absolute remarkable achievement.</p><p>Our second category is Women's Economy Security. As outlined last year in the department's first-ever Strategy for Global Women's Economic Security, the United States considers the full and equal economic participation of women not only a moral imperative but a strategic one. Women's economic inclusion promotes stability, development, and harmony in communities. It's estimated that closing gender gaps in the workforce could add up to $28 trillion to global GDP over a decade. In this collective effort, we're fortunate to have committed private sector partners that we're going to recognize today.</p><p>In Ethiopia, California leather goods company Parker Clay has for a decade employed a majority-women workforce of local artisans, most of whom are survivors of human trafficking. That's incredible. In addition to a good job and good pay, Parker Clay has - also offers access to vital services such as on-site day care. This means that its employees can put food on the table and ensure that their children can attend school. And it means that they can become financially secure, able to breathe a bit easier, plan a bit farther, and sleep a bit more soundly.</p><p>In India, the Bank of America is working to realize gender parity across its ranks. The company has implemented inclusive recruitment strategies and female mentorship programs, initiatives that have brought their workforce to - from 24 to 35 percent over the past decade - that's remarkable - amid a nationwide decline in Indian women's economic participation. You've really stood out.</p><p>In recent years, Bank of America has also provided over 300,000 women and girls with the education, the health care, and the sanitation infrastructure necessary for entry to and success in the formal economy.</p><p>Our third and final category is Climate Resilience. Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the United States has quadrupled climate financing to the developing nations, helping more than half a billion people manage the destabilizing effects of climate change.</p><p>In the Philippines, Florida-based Rizome Bamboo produces a more sustainable alternative to traditional carbon-intensive materials like steel and wood. And it's promoting the construction of environmentally conscious bamboo-based homes globally. In partnership with USAID and local indigenous tribes, Rizome is also helping to plant 1,500-hectare reforestation program that would establish a bamboo industry in Mindanao, an arena in the Philippines that desperately needs jobs.</p><p>In Suriname, our final awardee, Colorado's Newmont Corporation, has introduced highest environmental standards into the country's goldmining sector. Newmont has significantly reduced the potential for mercury pollution, water contamination, and deforestation by training small-scale miners in more sustainable mining methods. The corporation also instituted an advisory council but with community leaders from the African-descent Pamaka tribe, who advised Newmont on how to best contribute to local development needs, from portable water systems to small business loans.</p><p>So you get a sense of what these companies are about. And I want all of you to join in giving a warm round of applause to all of our awardees. (Applause.)</p><p>And as I pass it back to Special Representative Morgenthau, I do want to just acknowledge it's good to be recognized for one day. But the truth is what you're doing is global on a yearly basis, and we recognize, acknowledge, and thank you for your work, and we hope that it long continues. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Well, I think you'll all have just seen and witnessed Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell, and he is hardly the B team. Those remarks and your leadership is exemplary. Having seen firsthand and been with him in the field, it is hard to keep up with him. But truly, his public service and commitment for so many years is exemplary, and we are very fortunate to have him at the department. (Applause.)</p><p>Deputy Secretary, I understand that you may have to depart a little bit early, so I just wanted to acknowledge and again thank you. As we celebrate the 25th anniversary, we reflect on the incredible journey and achievements of U.S. companies who have been awarded the ACE over the years. Your work around the world continues to inspire us all.</p><p>While we could elaborate extensively on the accomplishments of these companies, it is perhaps best to let their work speak for itself. At this time, please turn your attention to the screen for a brief montage that illustrates the truly inspiring stories of our awardees.</p><p>(A video is played.) (Applause.)</p><p>And now the moment that we've all been waiting for. We can begin with the presentations of the 2024 Awards for Corporate Excellence. The first category is Innovation to Strengthen Communities. We are proud to be recognizing two companies whose work has generated tangible positive impact in Colombia and Togo.</p><p>Microsoft in Colombia is this year's first winner, nominated by the U.S. Embassy Bogot\\xE1. Microsoft Colombia has harnessed their technological tools and digital capacity to strengthen communities by connecting them to the internet and to the world, helping refine their workers' skills and generating economic growth. We are delighted to have here today U.S. Charg\\xE9 d'Affaires to Colombia Francisco Palmieri - thank you for being here - who very kindly made a congratulatory video for Microsoft. Please turn your attention to the screen:</p><p>MR PALMIERI: (Via video) Secretary Blinken and distinguished guests, it is my distinct honor to congratulate Microsoft Colombia Incorporated for winning the Secretary's Award for Corporate Excellence in the category of Innovation to Strengthen Communities. This prestigious award is a testament to the remarkable impact that Microsoft has made in driving positive change in communities across Colombia.</p><p>Microsoft Colombia has partnered with NGOs, universities, small businesses, and national and local governments to expand internet connectivity, build digital skills, and foster economic inclusion for Colombia's most vulnerable and underserved communities. Their work helps promote peace, diminish Colombia's digital divide, and reduce economic and social inequalities.</p><p>Thank you, Microsoft, for your commitment to making Colombia and the world a better place. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Charg\\xE9 Palmieri, for being here with us today.</p><p>It is now my honor to present Microsoft Colombia Inc. with the 2024 Secretary of State Award for Innovation to Strengthen Communities. Please join me in welcoming the general manger of Microsoft Colombia, Daniel Verswyvel, to the stage to accept the award and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MR VERSWYVEL: Hello, all. Thank you, Assistant Secretary Holman and Special Representative Morgenthau. Members of the diplomatic services, honored guests, and colleagues, it's really an immense pride and a deep gratitude that I accept this prestigious Secretary of State Award for Corporate Excellence on behalf of Microsoft Colombia.</p><p>To be recognized for the impact we're making through our connectivity and skilling programs is a profound honor. This represents not only a milestone for our team, but a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and shared commitment to building a brighter future for all Colombians.</p><p>At Microsoft, we believe in a world where technology is a force of good, a tool that can transform lives, fuel economies, and reduce inequalities. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization to achieve more. And it is not only a vision, it is a responsibility as well. And we deeply feel this responsibility in Microsoft Colombia, where the need for connectivity and digital skills is a great pivot to unlocking the potential for so many.</p><p>The world we live in is increasingly defined by digital experiences. It shapes the way we work, we learn, we communicate, and live in society. But we know that for too many these opportunities remain a challenge. This is why we are relentless in our commitment to bridging the digital divide, and we recognize that access alone is not enough. It must be coupled with knowledge, with skills, and tools necessary for individuals to truly thrive and better their opportunities. Through initiatives like Airband we brough high-speed internet to some of the most remote and underserved communities in Colombia, giving people the chance to participate in the digital economy, to connect with their supply chains, establish their businesses, access government and healthcare services, and so much more.</p><p>Our skilling programs have gone hand in hand, equipping thousands with the capabilities they need to acquire the abilities to secure better jobs and create brighter futures for themselves, their families, and their communities. We have witnessed the power of this transformation. Communities once isolated are now connected. Individuals once without prospects are now building careers and future of their own design. This award is a reminder of what's possible and when we unite around common purpose. But it's also a challenge: a challenge to continue and to deepen our commitment to expand the impact and work.</p><p>As we stand here today, I want to emphasize that this honor belongs to every person and every organization that we have partnered with, every community that has embraced these opportunities and every organization that shares her vision for an inclusive and equitable future. We know no single organization and no single person has the power to make real widespread change, but together we are providing the technology that hopefully can be a catalyst for a long-lasting transformation.</p><p>Thank you for this remarkable recognition, and we - we're excited also of the road ahead and knowing that the best way to predict the future is really to create it together.</p><p>Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you for those remarks. We would now like to recognize our second winner in the category of Innovation to Strengthen Communities, Koster Keunen, for their work in Togo empowering local beekeepers and farmers and forging the path for millions of dollars to exports for an innovative product. We now have a congratulatory video from U.S. Charg\\xE9 d'affaires to Togo Ronald E. Hawkins:</p><p>MR HAWKINS: (Via video) Hello. My name is Ron Hawkins, and I'm the charg\\xE9 d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Lom\\xE9, Togo. It is my great pleasure to extend heartfelt congratulations to Koster Keunen for being honored with the Award for Corporate Excellence and Innovation to Strengthen Communities. To John, Silvan, and the whole team at Koster Keunen, you have empowered tens of thousands of beekeepers throughout West Africa. Thank you for demonstrating the best of American values in Togo. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Charg\\xE9 Hawkins. Please join me in welcoming the President of Koster Keunen, John Koster, to accept the 2024 Award for Innovation to Strengthen Communities and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MR KOSTER: Yeah, thank you, Acting Assistant Secretary Holman and Special Representative Morgenthau. It is an incredible honor to be here today in Washington, D.C. with my partners and my family accepting the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence. I want to thank the U.S. Ambassador to Togo Elizabeth Fitzsimmons and Deputy Chief Ronald Hawkins who we just saw and the Administrator for the Small Business Administration Isabel Guzman for the nomination and their support. We're deeply honored by this recognition from the U.S. Department of State, and we extend our sincere thanks to Secretary Blinken and the entire selection committee.</p><p>For over 170 years across five generations, Koster Keunen has been a global leader in manufacturing and refining natural waxes and ingredients. Our mission is to create sustainable and innovative solutions that benefit both people and planet, and today we stand before you as a testament to the power of business to drive positive change in the world. Our journey in West Africa began in 2019 where we saw an opportunity in beeswax, a by-product of honey production that was often overlooked and undervalued. Local beekeepers, despite their work and dedication, struggled to access modern techniques and export markets for the wax, limiting their income and potential.</p><p>We thought we could make a difference. We launched our sustainability program that we like to call One Hive. It's an initiative designed to empower beekeepers and transform the beeswax industry in West Africa. Through training, education, and the provision of modern beekeeping equipment like Kenyan Top Bar hives and proper bee suits, we equipped beekeepers with the tools and the training they needed to succeed. We introduced sustainable beekeeping practices, ensuring the long-term health of bee populations and their vital role in our ecosystem, as well as sustainable and reoccurring income for the beekeepers and their villages and communities.</p><p>And through a new program we initiated using blockchain technology, this allowed us to trace the beeswax from the hive to the final product, guaranteeing transparency and traceability. By eliminating intermediates and connecting beekeepers directly to global markets, we ensure that beekeepers receive a fair price for their labor, empowering them to reinvest in their families and communities.</p><p>The impact has been profound. Over 28,000 beekeepers across eight West African countries have seen their incomes rise and their livelihoods improve. Communities have been strengthened and families have been empowered, and the environment has benefited with forest preserves and biodiversity protected. This award is a tribute to the incredible people of West Africa whose reliance, resilience, and determination inspire us every day. It's also a testament to the power of collaboration. We're grateful to our partners on the ground, the U.S. Government for its support, and to our customers around the world who share our commitment to sustainability and community development.</p><p>At Koster Keunen, we believe that business can be a force for good. We are proud to be a part of a global movement as working to create a more just and sustainable world. This award strengthens our resolve to continue innovating, to continue empowering and strengthening communities, and to continue making a positive impact in our world.</p><p>Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: We now move to our next award category, Women's Economic Security. Women's Economic Security is a category that not only reflects our shared commitment to creating an inclusive economy but also demonstrates the immense power that women can have on their communities. Empowering women economically benefits all communities and helps us move towards a more just and equitable world. I say that when women win, we all win.</p><p>And I did want to recognize again that this was the 25th anniversary of the ACE Awards which was started by Secretary Madeleine Albright, and we are very honored to have her daughter here with us, Alice Albright, who has been carrying on in her mother's tradition of service and heads up the Millennial Challenge Corporation which the State Department works with closely.</p><p>The first company that we recognize in this category is Bank of America in India. Their commitment to ensuring women are part of the workforce and are given the same skills and opportunities as others is a priority of the bank's country head, Kaku Nakhate. Please join me in watching a brief congratulatory video from U.S. Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti:</p><p>AMBASSADOR GARCETTI: (Via video) Greetings from New Delhi. I'm Eric Garcetti, United States Ambassador to India. And on behalf of the U.S. mission here in India, I want to congratulate Bank of America in India for earning the Secretary's Award for Corporate Excellence in Women's Economic Security.</p><p>Bank of America in India through its president and India country director Kaku Nakhate, together with all of its employees, is leading the promotion of women as employees and entrepreneurs. As Kaku herself often says, Gender parity in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, but it also makes businesses more profitable and impactful.</p><p>Through its corporate social responsibility programs, Bank of America in India is also improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and girls throughout this great country. With companies like Bank of America in India and great leaders like Kaku and her team, India is striving to increase the percentage of women in its workforce, working towards its true potential as a global economic power befitting the world's largest democracy.</p><p>Congratulations and thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Ambassador Garcetti. I'd also like to thank our consul general in Mumbai, Michael Hankey, for being here with us today. And it is my privilege to invite president and country head of Bank of America in India, who can just be known as Kaku. So thank you so much for being here.</p><p>MS NAKHATE: Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>Good afternoon. Assistant Secretary Amy Holman, Special Representative Sarah Morgenthau, of course all the distinguished guests here, and my dear friends - it's my great honor to receive this prestigious ACE Award on behalf of Bank of America India, which is currently celebrating 60 years in India. I would like to thank all the secretaries right from State - Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, U.S. Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti, and of course my dear friend, Consul General Mike Hankey - for recognizing our work in India.</p><p>I'd like to thank Brian Moynihan, our CEO, the - and the entire global leadership for their constant support. Brian has always advocated responsible growth at Bank of America. Acting responsibly is one of our core values and guides how we invest in our communities and help them thrive. For Bank of America. India is a priority market. It's the second largest contributor to our APAC earnings, with over 15 percent share in revenues and more than 23 percent share in profit. This award really belongs to all my teammates across in India.</p><p>Over the last decade, we have deployed roughly 2 percent of our profits in India, amounting to $70 million, working with 30 partners supporting education and skills development, jobs and livelihood creation, environmental sustainability, water and sanitation, and arts and culture. Over the years we have transformed the lives of about 6 million individuals, including women and girls, which gives us great satisfaction. The important role that women can play in the world's GDP development is today recognized wholeheartedly, and you would all agree with me on that.</p><p>Today, nearly half of the workforce in the world is women, while India, only 37 are in the workforce. Unfortunately, they only contribute 18 percent of India's GDP, despite accounting for 48 percent of the overall population. The World Bank estimates that the loss due to gender inequality in the world is around 172 trillion, approximately 1.7 times the global GDP. So in India, if women's contribution to GDP just increased from 18 to 25 percent by 2030, we would add 1.5 trillion to take our economy to 6.5 trillion, a significant 30 percent gain.</p><p>Hence, we decided to apply a gender lens to program models centered around empowering women who we believe will create transgenerational impact in the society. We also focus on adolescent girls, because India accounts for 10 percent of the adolescent population in the world. Lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure has adversely impacted the cohort of girls for years. Our support to partners like Gramalaya, Shelter, MHT, and Vatsalya ensured a toilet in a girl's home, thus enhancing her esteem within the family. In the same cluster, schools were provided with toilets. The idea was the basic need and retaining girls in school. To date, our partners have built 19,000 toilets.</p><p>Our program with Quest Alliance provides STEM and life skills to adolescent students. With UWA, we created smart classrooms and government-run schools, enabling blended learning, using tablets, enhancing STEM learning. We plan to introduce coding in classrooms very soon. Our vocational training programs with partners like Generation and Enable India, who work with individuals with disabilities, help deliver skills to enable employment in sectors like health care services, retail, and technology.</p><p>We support even rural programs with PRADAN and development alternatives that create local income generation opportunities for women, often on the back of community-owned renewables and energy micro-grids and irrigation systems. As a result, 50,000 women farmers and entrepreneurs have seen their income rise significantly, by 70 percent, over a two-year period. The intersectionality of our philanthropic programs hits multiple Sustainable Development Goals, providing access to clean energy, water, sanitation, elevating poverty, and improving, of course, the gender equality.</p><p>We work closely with CSMVS and MAP museum to help conserve India's rich cultural heritage. We supported AmCham in creating a DNI committee across American companies to focus on gender diversity, LGBTQ inclusion, and individuals with disabilities.</p><p>So on behalf of Bank of America, I once again would like to thank all of you and express our sincere appreciation to the State Department for this ACE Award. This will inspire us further to create more opportunities for women empowerment, which will help to make a difference in the society. And today, I learned genius and generosity is all that we need to work for.</p><p>So thank you once again for giving us this award. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Kaku, thank you. The next award in the Women's Economic Security category goes to Parker Clay, nominated by the U.S. embassy in Ethiopia. Parker Clay truly embodies the spirit of uplifting communities by helping women who were once victims of exploitation to become economically empowered individuals. We now have a congratulatory video from U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia Ervin Massinga:</p><p>AMBASSADOR MASSINGA: (Via video) Good day. As ambassador to Ethiopia, I am honored to congratulate Parker Clay for winning the Award for Corporate Excellence in Women's Economic Security. I'm proud to see their incredible work being celebrated. Parker Clay's commitment to ethical business and social impact in Ethiopia is transforming lives and empowering local communities. We nominated Parker Clay for creating sustainable jobs and fostering local craftsmanship, and because Parker Clay is not just building their brand - they're building a better future for Ethiopia. Parker Clay empowers Ethiopian women, helping them to harness traditional skills and local materials to create world-class products, while combating human trafficking. Parker Clay ensures its workers earn wages that support their families and provide them with the tools to uplift their communities on their own terms. Congratulations again to Brittany, Ian, and the entire Parker Clay team for this well-deserved award.</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: (Applause.) Thank you, Ambassador Massinga. And I am now proud to invite the cofounder and creative director of Parker Clay, Brittany Bentley, to the stage to accept the 2024 award for Women's Economic Security and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MS BENTLEY: Leading with heart doesn't just change the outcome; it redirects the course of our world. It's 2015 and I'm seven months pregnant sitting on a small gray sofa. My husband, Ian, and I are in California, living in a friend's one-bedroom apartment with our five kids. That's when I get the news our youngest daughter, Sayla, needs a brain surgery for a rare brain tumor.</p><p>My mind races back to just three years earlier. Ian and I sold everything, left California, and moved to Ethiopia on one-way tickets. Adopting two girls, brought us to Ethiopia, but once there, we saw that creating sustainable jobs for women, especially mothers, could strengthen entire communities. What began as a job training program quickly grew into something much bigger: empowering women through trade and launching a startup deeply rooted in the place that became our home.</p><p>Suddenly, our daughter was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, and it felt like that dream was slipping away. We knew we had to leave and move back to the west coast to get her the care she needed - back to sitting on that sofa and hearing the news. As a mom, I'm heartbroken, feeling helpless and desperate as I watched my youngest suffer. How do I carry the weight of that and continue building Parker Clay?</p><p>I thought about Marta back in Ethiopia. Struggling with her vision loss, she joined Parker Clay and found not just a job but recognition and care. After receiving her glasses through our team's support, her world - for the first time, she said, My world has transformed. I not only see, I feel seen. And Saleh and Bertukan met at Parker Clay, started a family, and are now thriving with the help of our day care program. Their child is nurtured nearby while they work and save for a better future.</p><p>And there are so many more lives in Ethiopia that we can directly impact, yet at the same time, my family in California is counting on me too. I feel so conflicted, but every time I think of the strength and resilience of the mothers there, I'm reminded that I'm far more capable than I was taught.</p><p>It's at that moment that Ian and I make one of the most important decisions of our lives: to go all in on our business, not just as our own venture but for the lives of the women whose stories were too often left untold. We chose purpose over comfort because the impact we were striving for was far greater than our fears.</p><p>Now, over a decade later, I stand before you with deep pride. Two of our daughters are here today, the one I was pregnant with - (applause) - and Sayla, who is thriving after three brain surgeries, reminding us that the hardest moments also defined us. (Applause.) That commitment to build a business with heart, driven by impact, was the best decision we ever made. We put people first, and that choice didn't just change lives, it changed the way we see the world. Imagine what we could all achieve if we led businesses with heart and built them with purpose.</p><p>Today, our team of 200 artisans - 80 percent women - shows that compassion and business go hand in hand. As Ethiopia's largest exporter of finished leather goods and a top-ranking B Corp, Parker Clay sets the standard for quality and impact in ethical manufacturing. Now we're extending this excellence to other global brands and redefining success, not just by profits but by lives transformed, like Marta's, Saleh's, and Bertukan's.</p><p>Through this journey I've learned that success isn't just measured in profits or growth - though, of course, those matter - but also in the lives we impact along the way. For me, this started with my own family and extends across oceans to Ethiopia. Parker Clay isn't just a business. It's proof that when we lead with heart, we change the world, one life at a time.</p><p>And speaking of leadership, I want to thank Secretary Blinken for this honor and recognition; U.S. Ambassador of Ethiopia Mr. Massinga; Minister of Industry Atu Melaku; Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed; and, of course, our entire community, who have joined forces in creating this impact together. Your faith in us is a continued inspiration. I invite you to join us, because together we have the power to transform lives, one woman at a time. Thank you, or in Ethiopia, we say amesegnalehu. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: That was pretty amazing. I just need to take a quick pause. We are a little - very structured here at the State Department, but your mother is a badass. (Applause.)</p><p>We now move to the final category of this year's Secretary Award for Corporate Excellence, Climate Resilience. Our first award in this category goes to Newmont Corporation, nominated by the U.S. embassy in Suriname. Their community collaboration and use of tools to eliminate mercury pollution sets the standard for responsible mining practices in Suriname. We are grateful to have U.S. Ambassador to Suriname Robert Faucher here with us today. The ambassador very kindly made a congratulatory video for Newmont Corporation, and I invite you to turn to the screen:</p><p>AMBASSADOR FAUCHER: (Via video) Good morning. It is my honor to congratulate Newmont Mining for winning one of this year's Awards for Corporate Excellence. Newmont has operated in Suriname for over a decade, and during that time has been an outstanding example of corporate responsibility and environmental stewardship. Newmont has shown that running a successful company and protecting the environment are mutually reinforcing. Newmont's work has enriched the lives of countless Surinamese, while ensuring future generations can enjoy Suriname's natural beauty and biodiversity. Thank you, Newmont, for your leadership and for your commitment to a greener and more prosperous future. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Ambassador Faucher, and this time, please join me in welcoming the senior director of external relations for Newmont Suriname, Shirley Sowma-Sumter, to accept the 2024 ACE Award for Climate Resilience and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MS SOWMA-SUMTER: Good afternoon, everyone. Acting Secretary - Assistant Secretary Amy Holman, Special Representative Sarah Morgenthau, the honorable Ambassador of Suriname to the U.S. Mr. Schalkwijk, and the honorable Ambassador of the U.S. to Suriname Mr. Faucher, distinguished guests, and all who are joining us today, it is with deep gratitude and appreciation that I accept this prestigious ACE Award on behalf of Newmont and our incredible team at Merian, Suriname.</p><p>Our workforce at the Merian, Suriname of nearly 1,400 teammates have come together to make an impact, and it's a privilege to be recognized for our efforts. Since we began operating in Suriname in 2016, we have lived following Newmont's purpose, which is to create value and to improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. And in alignment with our purpose, we have always recognized the critical needs of the local communities we operate in, particularly when it comes to infrastructure and economic opportunities, challenges that may have grown more urgent in the face of climate change.</p><p>Over the years, we have launched numerous initiatives aimed at reducing deforestation, rehabilitating the land, and improving water efficiency. But beyond environmental stewardship, our local programs have delivered tangible and life-changing benefits to these communities. We are deeply committed to enhancing the quality of life for our neighbors. Whether it's working hand in hand with small and artisanal small-scale miners to mitigate their environmental impact, or supporting and fostering new opportunities for local businesses within our value chain, we believe that sustainable growth starts with partnership and collaboration.</p><p>Newmont plays a significant role in supporting and advancing Suriname - Suriname's green development goals, and we will continue to increase our impact in this area in close collaboration with our stakeholders. This unwavering dedication to our purpose has remained constant over the years, driving socioeconomic development in the communities we are privileged to serve.</p><p>I'm grateful for everyone who has helped us along the way, from our dedicated employees and our partner, Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V., the state-owned oil company. And without their unwavering commitment, we would not be here today. I'm especially grateful to Ambassador Robert Faucher for nominating Newmont's work in Suriname. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>And on behalf of Newmont, a 103-year-old American company with 40,000 employees operating in nine countries, and the team of Newmont in Suriname, we look forward to continuing our partnership with the Government of Suriname and surrounding communities in pursuit of even greater achievements in the future.</p><p>For those of you tuned in on the webcast from Suriname, I cannot wait to bring this award back home and celebrate with all of you. Thank you once again for this incredible honor. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you very much. Last but not least, the final award in the category of Climate Resilience goes to Rizome, nominated by U.S. Embassy Manilla. Rizome's innovative projection of bamboo to provide a more sustainable alternative construction material exemplifies the American private sector's ingenuity and ability to adapt to the climate crisis. We are delighted to have U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson here with us today. The ambassador very kindly made a congratulatory video for Rizome. Please turn your attention:</p><p>AMBASSADOR CARLSON: (Via video) Congratulations to Rizome for winning the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence for Climate Resilience. I recently visited Rizome's impressive facility in Mindanao, where they are combining American innovation and Filipino expertise to turn renewable and fast-growing giant bamboo, the miracle timber, into sustainable building materials that are as strong as steel and tough as concrete. Rizome's investment promotes green construction while contributing to the U.S.-Philippine economic relationship as partners in prosperity. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Ambassador Carlson. It's my honor to present Rizome with a 2024 ACE Award for Climate Resilience. Please join me in welcoming founder and chief product officer David Sands to accept this year's final award and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MR SANDS: Well, thank you, Acting Assistant Secretary Holman, Special Representative Morgenthau, and distinguished guests. It's an honor to be here representing our entire Rizome team. I especially want to thank Ambassador MaryKay Carlson, whose staff nominated us. Thank you as well, Ambassador Carlson, for visiting our operations in Mindanao.</p><p>Thank you to USAID Philippines and their staff, who helped fund one of our first reforestation programs. Thank you to One Tree Planted, who helped support that effort as well. And thank you to Climate Impact Partners, who is funding our current planting program of about 17,000 acres.</p><p>Thank you to our investors and our chairman, Fred Murrell, who believed in our vision. Thank you to the entire Rizome team now implementing that vision, especially our CEO Russell Smith, who has shared that vision with me for over a decade and tirelessly implements it. Thank you to our manufacturing teams headed by Chris Ua-o and Ruel Rivalde and our planting teams headed by Eileen Gamo.</p><p>I'm joined here today by our CFO Chara Panagopoulos, who has seen us through from the beginning; by our partner Cito Lorenzo, former secretary of agriculture for the Philippines, a tireless advocate for the well-being of the rural communities of the Philippines and for the health of the planet; and by my brother Bill and his wife Julie, who have really supported me through the decades in this adventure with bamboo. And again, to Fred, we basically grew up together, and he's a former chairman of two Fortune 500 companies and brings that expertise to the work we're doing.</p><p>My work with bamboo started in the 1990s with the creation of Bamboo Living, making homes out of structural bamboo as an alternative to wood to reduce deforestation. As the impact of climate change increased, we looked to bamboo as a solution. We founded Rizome as a climate solution. It seemed so obvious - noninvasive tropical timber bamboos are, after all, the fastest growing woody plants on the planet. If you look at the Guinness Book of Records, they say 35 inches a day. I haven't seen that yet, but we - at least a foot a day. And then they feed on carbon dioxide. The annual harvest stimulates further growth with bamboo plants, and the plants can live for a century or more.</p><p>But nobody was doing what, to me, was so obviously needed to be done. So we started Rizome to do the obvious. Where I grew up in Florida, I played in a bamboo plant that is well over 120 years old. It was growing at Chairman Fred's family home, and his mother played in that same clump as a child.</p><p>So what are we doing at Rizome? By reforesting land that was deforested decades ago, we are creating an engine for the rapid removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, 10 times faster than trees. We're creating an engine that can scale quickly to gigaton levels of impact. We're one of the top solutions, according to climate - the Carbon Removal XPRIZE, and they did not include avoided emissions, which is half of our impact.</p><p>We use only land that is not being used for agriculture to avoid impacting food security. With the help of Cito and others who are using regenerative agriculture techniques, we are doing that without the need for commercial fertilizers and pesticides.</p><p>The wonderful thing we are finding as we implement our strategy is the broad positive social and environmental impacts beyond climate. With our projects in Mindanao, we're addressing every one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in some way, including the former insurgents are now a supplier to us. Our planting partners are indigenous tribal members, and our planting program and our nursery are run by indigenous women. We're helping the tribes reforest their deforested lands of their ancestral domains and create multigenerational livelihoods for their communities by the annual harvest of the bamboo, and then long-term community-held assets in the bamboo plants.</p><p>Bamboo is actually a superfood, containing all the essential amino acids and is high in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It can be a tool for addressing global malnutrition and assuring food security. Our primary focus at Rizome is carbon, the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the long-term storage - excuse me, I get choked up - the long-term storage of that carbon to keep it getting - from getting back into the atmosphere. The bamboo building materials are making a really - real storage mechanism for the CO2 that's captured by the bamboo plants. The tropical bamboo, timber bamboos, they have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than steel and a greater compressive strength than concrete with a fraction of the weight.</p><p>Bamboo is an amazing structural material. We're working with Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, the architects for the Burj Khalifa, on the first high-rise that will incorporate structural bamboo. The IEA projected that the square footage of buildings on Earth will double in the next 40 years. Wood, steel, and concrete are responsible for 25 percent of human emissions currently. We need to build differently. Engineered timber bamboo offers an alternative - rapid renewability and long-term storage of carbon.</p><p>The IPCC says we need to - at least 10 gigatons of removal a year by 2050. And tropical bamboo, with the support of the State Department and others, can deliver that level of impact. Free enterprise - it's one of the great gifts of this wonderful country. We can save our climate and make money doing it. It's no longer business as usual. It's business as a climate solution and community upliftment. And that's everybody's business.</p><p>God bless the United States of America. God bless this beautiful planet and all of us who share it. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: David, that was amazing. Thank you so much for your remarks. And I think it really says we can - to all of you businesses, the work that's being done, good business and doing business really do go hand in hand. But the work that's being done around the world really is amazing. I am really thrilled to join everybody in congratulating all of the 2024 Secretary of State's Awards for Corporate Excellence recipients. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>And finally, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose Fernandez. Under Secretary Fernandez stands at the center of the department's effort to support American businesses and American workers at home and abroad. Under his leadership, we have championed American companies around the world and made meaningful connections with the U.S. private sector to assist them in addressing critical global challenges, including in climate change, inequality, supply chain disruptions, food and energy security, mineral security, and other key areas.</p><p>As someone who has worked tirelessly supporting U.S. businesses and advancing U.S. commercial diplomacy, Under Secretary Fernandez has been involved in many ACE ceremonies, and it is now my great pleasure to welcome him to the podium to offer closing remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>UNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ: Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It's great to be here. Thank you - thank you Special Representative Morgenthau, thank you, Sarah. Amy, good to see you. Thank you all for the kind introduction, and thanks to all of you for being here today and for those of you who are watching on livestream.</p><p>I'd like to just first of all congratulate the six winners. After many years of seeing companies of all types receive this honor - this is our 25th year of having this award, and I'm really excited to be here for the 25th anniversary. But I do have a complaint. I have a complaint, which is at every - I've now done six of these. At each one of them, I tend to close the ceremonies. I am the grim reaper; I end the festivities.</p><p>This is a wonderful - a wonderful - moment for us at the State Department. It's a great opportunity for us to honor companies that have done well and have really highlighted and stuck by the principles that we all hold dear. So please join me to - for one last round of applause for the six winners. (Applause.)</p><p>The companies that we are honoring today showcase the best in American innovation and values. They demonstrate that businesses can flourish while being corporate role models. The shared values of protecting our planet, of helping our workers, of helping our local communities are at the forefront of the operations of all of these companies around the world.</p><p>You will have heard my colleague, Deputy Secretary Campbell, say that the global challenges that we all face cannot be solved by governments alone. This job makes you humble. But that's why the partnership between U.S. companies and the State Department is so crucial to advance our foreign policy. We know - we know that American companies are among the best and most innovative in the world, and we know that they are among the best equipped to contribute creative solutions.</p><p>The tools and the resources of the private sector, coupled with their commitment to doing well while serving the public good, is exactly - exactly - why American companies, I think, are the - this is an easy job in many ways, because American companies are the world's business partner of choice, and that's why we are honoring them today. We want - every year, we want to see more and more of them.</p><p>Here at the State Department, we work every day to promote a friendly environment for businesses operating abroad. When we work with the private sector, we learn how to combine our tools and try to outmaneuver the competition, and at the same time share our values in every corner of the globe. And whether it's protecting economic freedom for women in Ethiopia or keeping our planet safe in Suriname, American companies like the ones that we have recognized this afternoon have a track record of addressing critical issues and innovative solutions in local communities and keeping our principles at the forefront of all that they do.</p><p>This is why Sarah's office and why the Office of Commercial and Business Affairs and our government agency colleagues, many of whom I see in the audience, from ambassadors who've come all the way from the Philippines, from Suriname, and elsewhere, to honor their companies - that's why our government agency colleagues, that's where - at the State Department we work hard to connect U.S. businesses to foreign markets and to help highlight U.S. companies as the partners of choice.</p><p>Last March, a few months ago, I proudly joined other members of the administration in the rollout of something we're calling the second U.S. National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct. This is a set of government commitments to promote responsible business practices for our companies. We've also enhanced the U.S. National Contact Point for the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises to act as a contact point to receive comments and complaints about the conduct of our companies. So we've enhanced this National Contact Point to work with businesses, to work with NGOs, to work with labor unions to encourage responsible business conduct among U.S. companies operating overseas.</p><p>So the challenges that we face are complex. I'm confident that through innovative and principled solutions and our continued partnership, no challenge is impossible to overcome.</p><p>So to everyone here and to all those who are joining on our livestream, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to recognize the good work of these remarkable American companies. And so please join me one last time - one last time - in extending our sincere gratitude. (Applause.)</p><p>Thank you and congratulations.

Instead, firms need to switch to a \"nature-positive business model\". This is a new concept that is receiving support from the global business community.</p><p>The \"nature-positive business\" is simply understood as a method that creates positive impacts on the natural environment, from which firms would help protect nature and contribute to climate change response. In addition, the business method would create long-term growth for companies themselves. Promoting the circular economy model, equitable energy transition, and cutting carbon emissions are all directions of firms that choose to do business in a socially and environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>Enterprises in the world today are not only focusing on building and implementing sustainable development strategies within their businesses but also investing to increase participation and enhance capacity for suppliers and stakeholders in their value chain, thereby forming a sustainable ecosystem, Vinh said.</p><p>He also pointed out new trends in the world business community, which have a strong impact on sustainable business practices, including smart transformation, value chain transformation, and promoting accountability and digital transformation to complement green transformation.</p><p>The Vietnamese business community should pay attention and promptly grasp these trends to catch up with the international community, he added.</p><p>There is a close connection between circular economy implementation and carbon neutralisation goals and sustainable development, said Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyn C\\xF4ng Thanh, Head of the Department of Economics - Natural Resources Management and Environment at the National Economics University.</p><p>Currently, 54 countries have been developing a national strategy or action plan to implement the circular economy. In Vietnam, the circular economy and related issues such as waste separation at source, extended producer responsibility (EPR), green credit and green bonds have been included in the Law on Environmental Protection 2020.</p><p>It is necessary to raise awareness about the important role of the circular economy for sustainable development to businesses and communities. People should be aware that the circular economy will help achieve many goals, such as better economic development, emission reduction, cost reduction for businesses, reduced costs for consumers, and job creation, he said.</p><p>He added that the Government should improve effectiveness and remove policy and legal barriers; promote investment, association, cooperation and supervision in the implementation of the circular economy and promote innovation of circular economic models in production and consumption.</p><p>Firms join hands</p><p>Khut Quang H\\xFCng, Director of External Relations and Communication at Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam said that the Vietnamese Government has many policies to promote green growth and sustainable development. However, it is necessary to concretise these policies to be suitable for each period and each situation.</p><p>In order to deploy the circular economy, it is necessary to have specific solutions from the macro to the micro level, such as implementing incentives to promote green investment in agriculture; developing the legal framework, guidelines and regulations related to emission reduction throughout the value chain; establishing data systems, and auditing for emissions, H\\xFCng said.</p><p>Since 2015, all Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam factories have achieved the goal of \"No waste landfilled into the environment\". Many initiatives of the circular economy model have been applied by the company to effectively use resources. The water treatment system has helped the company reuse 60-65 per cent of the total wastewater. Their waste, including coffee grounds, sand from boilers, and more are used to become green energy, or input materials for other products.</p><p>Nestle Vietnam has come up with a very unique and effective solution to reducing carbon emissions upstream in the supply chain.</p><p>Nestle Vietnam has paid attention to suppliers, production, distribution, and packaging after use to implement the circular economy, he added.</p><p>In particular, emissions from agricultural activities and input materials account for more than two-thirds of the group's total greenhouse gas emissions. It is the reason that Nestle Vietnam has focused on investing in reducing emissions from production. Accordingly, to reduce emissions upstream of the value chain, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam has implemented two strategic solutions: promoting regenerative agriculture and conserving and regenerating forests.</p><p>Its regenerative agriculture strategy has been concretised by the NESCAF\\xC9 PLAN programme that has been implemented in the Central Highlands provinces since 2011. It has brought positive impacts on the environment and economic benefits for farmers in 16,000 households cultivating sustainable coffee according to 4C standards. Some 65 per cent of coffee gardens apply the model of intercropping and agroforestry, distributing more than 73 million high-quality seedlings to help replant more than 73,000ha of old coffee area (as of July 2023).</p><p>Nguyn Th Ngc Hu, Director of External Relations and Communication at AEON Vietnam - one of the leading retailers in Vietnam said: Being aware of the importance of the circular economy, AEON Vietnam has accompanied consumers to help them change their perception of the role of environmental protection.</p><p>For example, AEON Vietnam has limited use of plastic bags in their activities. In order to create a habit and help consumers get used to this programme, AEON Vietnam has designed an environmentally-friendly bag that meets the needs of shoppers, reduces prices, and is convenient. Since then, consumers have gradually abandoned the habit of using plastic bags.</p><p>Home Credit, one of the first foreign enterprises to provide consumer financial products in Vietnam, is the pioneer in offering low-interest loan packages for instalment loans to buy electric motorbikes and household goods, especially those that are environmentally friendly. - VOV</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68SH-M461-JB5P-J0PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1116\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 25, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This guarantees to increase the prestige of the CSI programme.</p><p>The updated CSI 2023 programme includes 130 indicators, including 82 basic indicators on legal compliance and 48 advanced indicators on building a healthy business ecosystem to ensure long-term and sustainable benefits for partners and other stakeholders. Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam has excellently achieved these indicators and is ranked top among the 500 businesses that applied to participate in the programme.</p><p>\"With a vision to become a global company that maintains local connections and leads the way in sustainable development, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam has been consistently striving to implement solutions and initiatives across all aspects, including the environment, society and governance. These efforts contribute significantly to the overall socio-economic development of the country. By fostering close collaborations with partners in Vietnam, we are able to generate positive impacts on the community, the environment and the planet. Achieving the top position in the CSI ranking for three consecutive years is a proud recognition of our continuous endeavours in fulfilling our long-term investment commitments and promoting sustainable development in Vietnam, said Binu Jacob, General Director of Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam.</p><p>Following the outstanding results of continuous sustainable development over the years, 2023 marks many new steps forward for Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam in environmental, economic and social aspects.</p><p>In June, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to co-operate with the MARD to promote and share regenerative agriculture practices, low-emission agriculture, and respond to climate change. They would also strengthen technology transfer, research, development and digital transformation, and multi-stakeholder co-operation.</p><p>In 2023, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam officially launched the \"Sustainable coffee farming according to the combined agro-forestry model\" project in Vietnam, aiming to plant more than 2.3 million trees to contribute to reducing absorption and storage of about 480,000 tonnes of carbon in the 5-year period (2023-27).</p><p>In January 2023, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam was honoured in the list of the largest corporate income tax payers in Vietnam in 2022. This was the 7th consecutive time Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam was honoured in the list, issued by the General Department of Taxation under the Ministry of Finance since 2016.</p><p>The \"Nestl\\xE9 accompanies women\" programme by Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam in co-operation with the Vietnam Women's Union has been expanded to 21 provinces and cities, with the participation of more than 5,000 women in 2023, contributing to the development of rural economy and enhancing the role of women in building the family economy.</p><p>In October, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam was honoured as \"Typical Enterprise for workers\" in 2023, in a programme chaired by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour, in co-ordination with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, and VCCI. This is the 4th consecutive year that Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam has received this title. In November, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam was honoured with the Top position in the ranking of Best Places to work in Vietnam in 2023 for large enterprises, announced by Anphabe. With survey results from nearly 64,000 employees across Vietnam, the award is a testament to the company's persistent efforts in building an advanced, suitable working environment for employees to develop their capabilities, towards common values. - VNS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69WW-VWT1-JB5P-J3RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 19, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

In Vietnam, the company is implementing many initiatives to help reduce emissions throughout the entire value chain, contributing to the transformation of a sustainable, regenerative food system, improving people's livelihoods, and life quality of the community.</p><p>As the world's leading food corporation, Nestl\\xE9 is working to promote the transition to a regenerative food system through co-operation with farmers, suppliers, retailers and customers. In Vietnam, Nestl\\xE9 is supporting farmers, contributing to the transition to regenerative agriculture in coffee farming in the Central Highlands. Through the Nescaf\\xE9 Plan programme deployed in the Central Highlands provinces since 2011, Nestl\\xE9 and farmers have implemented many initiatives that contribute to improving the quality of Vietnamese coffee beans, preserving soil and biodiversity, reducing impact of climate change, promoting biodiversity and increasing income for farmers.</p><p>Towards realising the Net Zero goal, Nestl\\xE9 strengthens co-operation with ministries, specialised units, business partners, and farmers to jointly implement initiatives to reduce emissions throughout the entire value chain, from input materials, production to post-consumer product packaging.</p><p>As for input materials, green coffee beans in Vietnam are currently purchased responsibly by Nestl\\xE9 through Nescaf\\xE9 Plan. This programme has helped farmers save 40 - 60 per cent of water used for irrigation in coffee farming, and reduce the amount of fertilisers/pesticides by 20 per cent.</p><p>Since 2015, 100 per cent of Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam's factories have achieved the goal of \"No solid waste landfilled in the environment\". In 2022 alone, thanks to initiatives to reuse, recycle and circulate water, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam factories saved more than 240,000cu.m of water in production. All coffee grounds are reused as biomass fuel for boilers in coffee production, helping reduce an average of more than 14,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions and save VN\\xD054 billion in fuel costs each year. By the end of 2022, nearly 90 per cent of Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam's product packaging is designed to be recyclable and reusable.</p><p>Thanks to its continuous efforts to bring nutritious products that are good for the health of users and build sustainable regenerative food systems in Vietnam, Nestl\\xE9 was honoured as the most sustainable enterprise in the manufacturing sector for two consecutive years of 2021 and 2022.</p><p>Every year, the leading brand valuation consulting company Brand Finance evaluates the 5,000 largest brands and publishes more than 100 reports, ranking brands across all fields and countries. The Top 100 strongest and most valuable Food brands in the world are included in the annual Brand Finance Food 100 ranking in 2023. - VNS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6968-1TH1-JB5P-J3KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 18, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Efforts to reduce costs for farmers, increase yield and develop soft-textured rice varieties that align with market demand are paramount. Other exporting nations have made significant progress in R and D, resulting in rice strains that are competitive with Thai rice.\"</p><p>According to Mr Chookiat, the government must also develop irrigation systems, such as canals and reservoirs, because without action Thailand's rice exports could deteriorate.</p><p>He said during a recent meeting with wholesalers in Malaysia, they told him they did not buy Thai hom mali rice because it loses its fragrance after the initial part of the season. In addition, the variety can only be grown once a year.</p><p>In contrast, Vietnam's fragrant rice can be grown multiple times over three months, resulting in a consistent supply of aromatic rice, said Mr Chookiat.</p><p>\"The government should avoid market price interference as it could stunt the market. If assistance to farmers is necessary, it should focus on harvest cost subsidies and the development of new rice varieties with cultivation periods of less than 120 days, potentially even 100 days,\" he said.</p><p>Nipon Puapongsakorn, a distinguished fellow at Thailand Development Research Institute, said market intervention in terms of pricing or rice pledging should be avoided, unlike in previous administrations.</p><p>If a support policy is needed, rice prices should not be set excessively high and the price support should be provided with conditions attached, he said.</p><p>\"A price guarantee scheme is okay, but it should come with conditions such as requiring participating farmers to take care of the environment through practices such as alternate wet and dry methods because of water scarcity, regenerative agriculture techniques, the adoption of new technology, and avoidance of burning,\" said Mr Nipon.</p><p>He urged the new government to review policies and triple farmers' income within three years, saying this could prove challenging based on constraints farmers face in adapting to and accepting new technologies. The average yield for hom mali rice in the northeastern region is 370 kilogrammes per rai. Increasing the yield to 600 kg per rai might take up to five years, said Mr Nipon.</p><p>He said globally it usually takes farmers around 10 years to fully adopt new technologies.</p><p>\"The challenge remains how to effectively accelerate this adoption in less than 10 years, especially for small-scale farmers. Tripling income by increasing yield to 1,000 kg per rai is difficult. In the central region, where the yield is 800 kg per rai, increasing it to 1,600 kg per rai is difficult because farmers lack new technologies,\" said Mr Nipon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG020920230001017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6937-YDW1-JCH9-G23V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24135\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 2, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D4DR</classCode><className>GRAIN EXPORTS &amp;

The best is yet to come as we further open up the economy and manage the external headwinds, Panga said.</p><p>He said PEZA has investment leads in vaccines and life science, the new wave of electric vehicle battery technology, motorcycle manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging and testing services, regenerative agriculture, organic fertilizers and pesticides, health care, deep learning, financial technology and other frontier technologies, anaerobic wastewater treatment and liquefied natural gas facilities.</p><p>These investment prospects came from PEZA zone developers and several business delegations that the investment promotion agency received in the past months.</p><p>As always, our strategy is to follow thru investment leads from PBBM's (President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr.) state and working visits to other countries to promote the Philippines as a smart destination in the region. Guided by DTI's Science, Technology, and Innovation-driven industrialization strategy, we also aim to create more ecozones and smart townships in rural and new growth areas to accelerate countryside development, the PEZA chief added. - PNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67WT-F9G1-DXMS-81VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 31, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I am in a category which, I understand, is described by the political scientists as a \"happy warrior\". Being in this business, you have to be optimistic because you see what kind of distance we have already covered.</p><p>Ester Baiget also shared her opinions with Euronews from a purely business perspective, she was also optimistic, stating the Green Deal \"is moving us all in the right direction.\"</p><p>\"There is a strong dependence [on] the fossil base that we cannot simply ignore. Then, investments need to be for the future. Every single investment needs to be for green energy. For solar, for wind, for methane, for Power-to-X, injecting the cash, the investments, these precious dollars, these precious euros, on the solutions of the future.</p><p>\"Same for food, for agriculture, investment in regenerative agriculture, investments in plant-based protein... this should be a gradual move and that will generate growth and that will generate jobs\".</p><p>What does the Green Deal mean for Europe?</p><p>The Green Deal was implemented by the current administration to help Europe transition into a resource-efficient economy and tackle climate change, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, increase food security and ultimately, generate net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>It contains goals for the energy, mobility, agricultural and construction sectors with intermediate targets set for 2030. The Fit for 55 legislative package precisely defines the actions required to achieve the 2030 target.</p><p>The Commission vowed to mobilise 1 trillion over a ten-year period to help Europe transition and to ensure that no member state is left behind in the process. This money will be taken from the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan, the EU budget as well as grants from public and private investors.</p><p>But, according to Brussels, the EU will still need to invest 1.5 trillion per year between 2031 and 2050 if the bloc is to reach its ultimate goal. One milestone is for the member states to slash their emissions by 55 per cent of 1990 levels before 2030.</p><p>Who is making progress?</p><p>Preliminary calculations made by the Agora Energiewende think tank in early January suggest CO2 emissions across Germany have already dropped by 73 million metric tonnes, compared to 2022's figures - the lowest levels seen since the 1950s.</p><p>In addition, the think tank reported that renewable energy sources accounted for more than half of the country's energy production in 2022 while electricity production using black coal has also dropped to 8.9% from 12.8%.</p><p>Despite these wins in Germany, some industrial sectors and businesses, as well as the farming community, feel that complying with the EU's environmental regulations is too difficult in the wake of inflation and rising energy prices as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This has in turn fuelled climate-sceptic parties predominately on the right in their calls for a pause in environmental legislation who argue that the net-zero transition away from fossil fuels is too costly.</p><p>In the face of political headwinds, the EU has vowed to charge on towards its goal but, with the European elections on the horizon, it has become evident that public support is key for the future survival of the Green Deal.</p><p>\"When you want to build public support, start with the obvious win-win solutions\" advised Prime Minister Mitsotakis, \"and be very careful with agriculture, because agriculture on its own is a very, very complex topic. It's very difficult to decarbonise. And, we need to be very sensitive when it comes to reactions from our farmers.\"</p><p>Balancing transition against targets and energy security</p><p>Maksym Timchenko, the CEO of DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy investor, also weighed in: We are in a situation where we have to balance coal mining and coal power generation, playing a crucial role in national security, at the moment.</p><p>\"We have thousands of coal miners working in Ukraine, at the moment. On the other side, Ukraine is committed to following all standards and regulations coming from Europe. So, for us, it's extremely important that it's done in a fair way for the next ten years</p><p>According to Prime Minister Mitsotakis, the future of energy security is clear. \"In the short term, we want to be an energy provider for at least the Balkans, by building strong interconnections, pipelines, floating storage and regasification units in northern Greece, leverage our unique, geographic potential, possibly even, if necessary, export gas up to Ukraine because, if you actually look at the map, the distance is not that far,\" he said.</p><p>Part of our medium- to long-term plan is to really make a breakthrough when it comes to offshore wind. But, in order to do that, we also need to build the necessary interconnections\" he said.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B66-P7H1-JB5P-J05C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1146\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 29, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004L76</classCode><className>NOVOZYMES A/S</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS325199 ALL OTHER BASIC ORGANIC CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC2869 INDUSTRIAL ORGANIC CHEMICALS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NZYM.B (CPH)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000639</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

We want action on climate change to be embedded, meaning that it is integrated into our action plan going forward,\" OIKN Head Bambang Susantono told ANTARA while attending the COP28 in Dubai in early December 2023.</p><p>The RLDC document is regional in nature and valid in the Nusantara region that covers an area of 252 thousand hectares. It covers the target to reduce emissions to -1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) in 2045 in the first scenario. Meanwhile, in the second scenario, there is a more ambitious target, namely reducing emissions to -1.5 MtCO2 in the same period.</p><p>The steps that are taken cover five sectors, namely forestry and other land use (FOLU), energy, industry, waste management, and agriculture.</p><p>For instance, in the FOLU sector specifically, the OIKN aims to conduct forest restoration in 45 percent of the total land for the first scenario and 47 percent for the second scenario. Overall, the authority targets forests to constitute 65 percent of Nusantara's land.</p><p>The new capital is also designed to have 100-percent renewable electricity sources by 2030, utilize more efficient cement by using cement additives, reduce waste, and apply sustainable agricultural practices by 2045.</p><p>In terms of electricity, the development process of a solar power plant, with a total capacity of 50 megawatts, has begun. Furthermore, Nusantara is targeted to be a city where only electric vehicles would ply on the roads by 2040.</p><p>These targets are not easy to achieve, considering the condition of the Nusantara area, which was earlier a monoculture industrial forest area and a former mining area whose ecosystem required massive environmental restoration. In the RLDC document, there is a target to restore a total of 83 thousand hectares of land.</p><p>Reforestation efforts have begun with the construction of a nursery in Mentawir, North Penajam Paser District, East Kalimantan, which can produce 15-20 million trees per year to support reforestation efforts.</p><p>There are also sustainable projects in Nusantara that will be carried out by cooperating with private parties.</p><p>In December 2023, the third phase of the groundbreaking of the Nusantara construction will take place. It covers 10 projects, with an investment value of around Rp10 trillion (around US$642.13 million).</p><p>Collaboration</p><p>As the first city in Indonesia to have a roadmap to reduce carbon emissions in its area, Nusantara cannot work alone to achieve its goal of becoming a green city. Not only from the private sector, communities at the grassroots level also have an important role in realizing the plans in the RLDC document.</p><p>Deputy for Environment and Natural Resources at the OIKN Myrna Safitri emphasized that the RLDC is inclusive in nature, where its implementation is not only carried out by OIKN but also by all parties that conduct activities in Nusantara. It also includes the indigenous people living in the area and new residents who will live there.</p><p>\"What is really important when we talk about RLDC is not just the presence of policies, not just the presence of programs because this is a matter of mindset and lifestyle,\" she noted on the sidelines of the COP28 event.</p><p>Several targets in the RLDC require collaboration with the community, including the target on waste management, with a target of recycling 60 percent of waste using a circular economy approach, namely reduce, reuse, and recycle (3R), and 40 percent being reprocessed into products.</p><p>Likewise, collaboration is also needed in the agriculture sector, which will apply sustainable practices, such as the use of biochar, which is a soil amendment made from organic waste. Regenerative agriculture and agroforestry practices will also be carried out in several degraded forest areas.</p><p>To this end, a permanent change in mindset and lifestyle is deemed necessary. One of the approaches to achieve this is the dissemination of information by religious and community leaders.</p><p>Chairman of the Environmental Protection Agency (LPLH) of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) Hayu Prabowo underscored the need to disseminate information on the issue of climate crisis and deforestation.</p><p>Through places of worship, religious leaders can continue to promote the message of protecting the environment in the country, including specifically encouraging better conditions in Nusantara.</p><p>Support also comes from the international community, including from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which supports Nusantara to become a city with zero carbon emissions.</p><p>Director General of the Southeast Asia Department of the ADB, Winfried Wicklein, highlighted the importance of the role of subnational governments, such as city governments, to achieve national climate targets, especially to create climate-resilient communities.</p><p>His side supports the planning of Nusantara to become a green city and the mobilization of the financial sector, especially from private parties, and helps to identify opportunities for collaboration between the government and the private sector.</p><p>Those various forms of support and collaboration from the community at the grassroots level, various religious institutions, the private sector, and the international community can help to realize the commitment to make Nusantara a zero-carbon city for all.</p><p>Source: ANTARA News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69W2-6R21-JB5P-J2DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 15, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009R7I</classCode><className>LAND RECLAMATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp;

That's why the Government of Canada is finding new ways to collaboratively engage across all sectors and governments to help support nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, launched the Conservation Exchange Pilot, an innovative, science-based initiative designed to enable more conservation work in Canada.</p><p>Businesses across Canada are reflecting on ways to reduce their carbon footprint and improve environmental sustainability practices, and the Conservation Exchange Pilot presents a voluntary opportunity for them to help conserve nature. For the first time, the Conservation Exchange is applying a science-based certification process that includes a standardized measure of biodiversity benefits to conservation projects. Funding partners will receive a certificate from Environment and Climate Change Canada to recognize their investments in nature.</p><p>The first three projects include:</p><p>- The Amherst Point Salt Marsh Restoration Project-to transition the landscape from unnatural and highly-modified habitats to richer, naturally-dynamic coastal wetlands. This project is being carried out by Ducks Unlimited Canada and partially funded by Irving Oil Ltd., in Nova Scotia.</p><p>- The MacKenzie Creek Restoration Project in Alberta-this watershed-scale restoration project, which will be carried out by Trout Unlimited Canada with funding support from Teck Resources Limited, will address stream health degradation at high-priority sites, and improving and protecting spawning and rearing habitat for Bull Trout and Athabasca Rainbow Trout (endangered).</p><p>- Precision conservation agriculture in Manitoba and Saskatchewan-this project involves helping farmers realize biodiversity benefits, including enhanced pollination, by converting areas of marginal cropland to perennial cover. It is being carried out by Ducks Unlimited Canada and supported by Nutrien and Maple Leaf Foods.</p><p>Organizations interested in participating in the Conservation Exchange are invited to visit Canada.ca to learn more about getting involved.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>Nature benefits us all and we can all contribute to protecting Canada's natural beauty. The Conservation Exchange Pilot is an innovative and mutually beneficial funding mechanism designed to enable more conservation efforts in Canada. We know that businesses are looking for meaningful ways to give back to the environment, and governments must find ways to share the responsibility for funding all the projects required to meet our domestic and international conservation goals. This pilot brings partners together to fund and implement effective conservation projects that address the fundamental issue of biodiversity loss.</p><p>- The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change</p><p>Ducks Unlimited Canada is proud to participate in the first projects delivered through the Conservation Exchange Pilot, alongside our valued partners at Irving Oil, Nutrien, and Maple Leaf Foods. These partnerships, which leverage public and private investments, demonstrate the shared leadership and action that's needed to scale-up conservation work across the country. Restoring the Amherst Point salt marsh will significantly benefit species at risk, allowing a host of wildlife to thrive within this rich coastal habitat. At the same time, working alongside Canadian farmers to implement regenerative agriculture practices will improve profitability, and increase pollinator habitat and biodiversity across the Prairies. The Conservation Exchange is an example of the whole-of-society approach that's needed to successfully restore nature nationwide.</p><p>- Michael Nadler, Chief Executive Officer, Ducks Unlimited Canada</p><p>Irving Oil has partnered with Ducks Unlimited Canada for more than 60 years, and we are proud of the work that we have done together to help conserve Atlantic Canadian wetlands and the wildlife that call them home. We are equally proud to have this important work recognized as we work together to achieve sustainability outcomes that result in measurable environmental benefits, promote strong biodiversity in our regions, and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions within Canada.</p><p>- Ian Whitcomb, President, Irving Oil</p><p>Maple Leaf Foods is proud to be part of one of the first projects selected for the Conservation Exchange Pilot. With our funding support, Ducks Unlimited Canada and Nutrien will work with farmers in our supply shed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to measure and quantify biodiversity benefits from implementing regenerative agriculture practices on the marginal lands around their farms. This is an important and innovative step to catapult conservation efforts in Canada and is clearly aligned with our sustainability goals at Maple Leaf Foods.</p><p>- Randy Huffman, Chief Food Safety and Sustainability Officer, Maple Leaf Foods</p><p>Biodiversity and water resources are critical to sustainable agriculture. That's why Nutrien is proud to engage in conservation efforts that work directly with growers, as well as food and agriculture industry partners, to support productive farming and restore forages on marginal land for positive local outcomes.</p><p>- Tim Faveri, Vice President, Sustainability and Stakeholder Relations, Nutrien</p><p>Trout Unlimited Canada has long been working with partners to conserve, protect, and restore Canada's freshwater ecosystems. Support from Teck Resources Limited will allow us to complete important rehabilitation work along MacKenzie Creek to protect Bull Trout and Athabasca Rainbow Trout and their habitats. The Conservation Exchange Pilot is an innovative mechanism enabling effective partnerships between industry, government, and the non-profit sector to address habitat and biodiversity challenges across Canada.</p><p>- Lesley Peterson, Director of Conservation, Trout Unlimited Canada</p><p>Supporting nature conservation and restoration in Canada is a key part of our work to increase the supply of the Canadian critical minerals that the world needs to enable decarbonization, while helping solve the global challenge of nature loss.</p><p>- Jonathan Price, Chief Executive Officer, Teck Resources Limited</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>- The Conservation Exchange Pilot is a three-year pilot project, funded as part of the Enhanced Nature Legacy program from Budget 2021.</p><p>- The Conservation Exchange Pilot is the first-ever application of a government-backed, science-based certification process that applies a standardized measure of biodiversity benefits to conservation projects.</p><p>- The Pilot is being developed and delivered in collaboration with industry associations, conservation organizations, interested provinces and territories, experts, Indigenous leaders, and other federal departments and agencies. An external working group meets quarterly to provide input and advice.</p><p>- Environment and Climate Change Canada intends to assess up to five projects through the Conservation Exchange Pilot and, with the support of an external working group, continues to seek potential projects and funding partners to participate in the initiative.</p><p>- Projects undertaken by the Conservation Exchange Pilot will help Canada make progress on commitments to halt and reverse nature loss in the country by 2030, while achieving a full recovery for nature by 2050.</p><p>Source: Government of Canada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:688G-J0K1-DXMS-81NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 22, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was the largest market for the EIF in 2023 by number of transactions and the third-largest by financing amount.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The main areas of activity of the European Union's public bank in France in 2023 were loans for combating climate change and adapting to its adverse effects, for supporting innovation and public facilities, and for sectors helping to strengthen EU sovereignty and strategic autonomy.</p><p>The EIB Group's results in France last year reflect strong momentum and significant growth in volumes, said EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle. They confirm our role in supporting investment in a challenging economic environment. The increase in our financing for the green and energy transition enables us to attract more private investment in support of EU priorities. Our loans in key and innovative sectors such as renewable energy, semiconductors and electric batteries all contribute to the European Union's competitiveness and strategic autonomy. More broadly, our financing in these sectors but also in education, health, transport and public infrastructure has a real impact on people's lives.</p><p>With 1.4 billion invested in SMEs last year, the EIF's activity in France was marked by strong demand, making it one of our most active markets and the largest market in Europe by number of transactions, said EIF Chief Executive Marjut Falkstedt. The EIF is a vital tool for the development of more competitive, greener and more digital SMEs through its essential bank guarantee business, which encourages financial intermediaries to take more risks, and its contributions to many investment funds that are now largely focused on clean technology and the green transition.</p><p>France top beneficiary of EIB climate and environment financing</p><p>With 64% of its lending volume devoted to climate action and environmental sustainability, France was the largest beneficiary of EIB financing in this area in 2023. This resulted in an overall investment of 6.9 billion in renewable energy, clean mobility and energy efficiency.</p><p>In 2023, the Bank invested 3.9 billion in France under REPowerEU, an EU initiative to reduce Europe's dependence on fossil fuels and accelerate the green transition.</p><p>Some of the flagship climate action projects in 2023 included several operations under the InvestEU investment support programme that aims to mobilise more than 372 billion in public and private financing across Europe by 2027. These were a 450 million loan to finance AESC's electric vehicle battery gigafactory in Douai, and 250 million for energy company Sor\\xE9gies for renewable energy and distribution network upgrades. The EIB contributed 150 million to the first issue of green bonds for automotive supplier Valeo and invested 442 million to develop Engie's new heating and cooling networks at 16 locations in France.</p><p>Increased support for all innovation</p><p>Innovation is another essential part of all activity in France. Investment in this area reached 3.9 billion last year. In the semiconductor industry, which is vital for strengthening the European Union's strategic autonomy in a sector where it still relies too heavily on foreign supplies, the EIB provided 750 million to GlobalFoundries. This investment will help finance its gigafactory in Crolles (Is\\xE8re). The factory will produce large-scale FDSOI chips requiring less energy. These chips are used in many sectors including the automotive sector, the internet of things (IoT) and mobile devices.</p><p>The EIB continued to invest in the health and life sciences sector by financing four medtechs in 2023, with a total of 95 million: Germitec (technology for the disinfection of medical probes with ultraviolet light), SafeHeal (postoperative treatment of colon cancer), Quantum Surgical (surgical robot for removing liver cancer tumours) and Wandercraft (walking exoskeleton for medical rehabilitation).</p><p>In digital infrastructure, the EIB provided 500 million to support the deployment of Orange's 4G and 5G mobile networks, 300 million for Iliad's 5G networks, and 150 million for investments under Auvergne Num\\xE9rique's ultra-fast internet plan. The EIB also granted a 250 million loan to Amadeus, the world leader in technology for the travel industry, for its investments in IT research and development.</p><p>Supporting sustainable public sector investments</p><p>As a partner of local and regional authorities, the EIB spent 4.5 billion on more sustainable public infrastructure investments (42% of financing) in 2023. This included 2.3 billion for public transport, the sector which received the most EIB loans in France last year. The EIB is also providing 1 billion to help finance Line 15 South of the Grand Paris Express metro. With a total length of 33 km, the line will cross 22 municipalities and serve more than 1 million people living in the Ile-de-France area. It is expected to be brought into service at the end of 2025. The EIB is also supporting Nantes, Strasbourg and Tours in their urban transport projects. In rail transport, it has signed financing agreements with the Centre-Val de Loire, Grand Est, Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Sud regions for a total of 825 million.</p><p>In the education sector, which has seen rapid growth with more than 900 million in investment in 2023, it will help finance the CentraleSup\\xE9lec campus in Saclay and the INSEAD campus in Fontainebleau. In secondary education, the EIB will finance school construction and renovation projects for lower secondary schools in five departments and upper secondary schools in Ile-de-France.</p><p>The EIB also signed two new intermediated loan packages with the Caisse des D\\xE9p\\xF4ts group in 2023 totalling 1 billion: 500 million for the construction of social housing and 500 million to finance the public facilities of local authorities.</p><p>1.4 billion from the EIF for small and medium businesses</p><p>Dedicated to supporting SMEs through bank guarantees and investment funds, the EIF, a subsidiary of the EIB Group, invested 1.4 billion in France last year, accounting for 9.4% of its total financing. The 20 bank guarantee operations mobilised 689 million. The 24 venture capital fund investment operations provided 674 million for startups specialising in infrastructure, deep tech, clean technology and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>In total and including all activities, the EIB Group directly or indirectly supported more than 52 000 SMEs in France in 2023, helping to safeguard 450 000 jobs.</p><p>Annual EIB Investment Survey</p><p>Climate change is increasingly becoming a reality for French companies. Almost nine out of ten (89%) of them are taking action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and 61% of companies surveyed believe climate events have an impact on their business. But fewer than four in ten (36%) have taken steps to strengthen their resilience to climate risks. Energy costs (84%), the availability of skilled staff (83%) and uncertainty about the future (80%) were identified as the main long-term barriers to investment.</p><p>Background information</p><p>About the EIB</p><p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its 27 Member States.

It will be funded from the \\xA32.4 billion annual farming budget, which is being maintained at its current level for the rest of this current Parliament.</p><p>Alongside the ongoing roll-out of the Environmental Land Management schemes, the grants will help to deliver long-term sustainable food production and support farmers to halt and reverse the decline of nature as set out in the Environmental Improvement Plan.</p><p>Farming Minister Mark Spencer said:</p><p>It's important that we fund projects like these - and those still to come in future rounds - as we support farmers to deliver sustainable food production and protect the environment.</p><p>Innovation, research and development will help keep the sector at the cutting edge of technology as we look into the future.</p><p>Katrina Hayter, Interim Executive Director Healthy Living &amp; Agriculture, Innovate UK, said:</p><p>These projects have all demonstrated not only an innovative solution to a real-life, on-farm problem, but also the value of partnerships and collaboration between different sector experts. For novel technology to truly succeed, it needs the input of the farmers themselves for the day-to-day realities of its use.</p><p>We're really pleased that these partnerships have this idea at their core, and we now look forward to working with them as they develop their solutions further and bring the benefits to life.</p><p>Successful projects</p><p>The Agri-Opencore project, led by APS Produce, has been awarded over \\xA33.8m to accelerate the delivery of robotic crop systems for horticulture. With labour shortages affecting the horticulture sector around the world, there are huge opportunities to reduce costs and labour requirements. The funding will help the project create the world's first open development platform (software and hardware) for agri-robotic crop harvesting. The open development platform will enable multiple organisations to contribute, allowing cross-sector collaboration and demonstration of technologies on English farms. It is hoped that the project will help to accelerate the adoption of robotic picking by two years.</p><p>Phil Pearson, from APS Produce, said:</p><p>The AGRI-OPENCORE robotics project is an exciting, and vital project for the fresh produce industry. It promises to deliver the significant progress required to automate fresh produce harvesting in the UK. As this work brings leading technology providers, Dogtooth, Xihelm and Wootzano, with the academic excellence of the University of Lincoln team, we can expect significant progress towards autonomous harvesting.</p><p>The AG ARC project, led by Garnett Farm Engineering, has been awarded over \\xA32.5m towards the development of an autonomous cow cubicle bedding unit. Cow comfort is a key factor in reducing the chances of cows suffering from mastitis, a fatal inflammation of their mammary gland, with dry and clean bedding and careful management of cubicles being vital. Currently, this must be done manually by farmers, but this project will develop an intelligent robotic cubicle bedder to monitor and respond to key sensor data to optimise dispensing of bedding. This will help to boost cow health and welfare, improve farm productivity and reduce costs through efficient use of bedding.</p><p>Andrew Garnett, of AG Products, said:</p><p>We look forward to collaborating with the University of Liverpool on this exciting project to further enhance our cattle bedding solutions to farmers, improving cow welfare and productivity. Our passion for innovation has seen the recent launch of the AG Duo; the AG ARC will further revolutionise the industry's approach to cattle bedding..</p><p>The Potato-LITE project has been awarded \\xA32,830,000 to explore optimised systems for potato cultivation. Current systems require the soil to be cultivated to create a deep and uniform seedbed, free from stones and clods, to provide a favourable environment for potato growth. Whilst reduced tillage technologies have enabled regenerative agriculture in cereal systems, this technology has not been developed for the production of potatoes and other root crops. Potato-LITE will transform potato tillage through developing new cultivation equipment and systems, delivered through a leading partnership between food manufacturers (PepsiCo and McCain), a machinery manufacturer (Grimme), growers (Strawson Ltd, JRO Griffiths, H Sutton &amp; Son and JM Bubb &amp; Son) and research organisations (Cranfield University, Harper Adams University and CHAP). The project focuses on reducing the depth, intensity and number of operations required, which will improve soil health and reduce the environmental impact of potato production whilst also reducing costs, making the \\xA3824 million potato sector more resilient and sustainable.</p><p>Shaunagh Slack, Project Lead for Potato-LITE, Regen Ag Scientist, Agricultural Science, PepsiCo, said:</p><p>At PepsiCo, agriculture is core to our business and we believe that sustainable agricultural practices are pivotal in protecting and enhancing our natural resources. Through Potato-LITE, we have a unique opportunity to form a leading industry and academic partnership to transform potato tillage and quantify the benefits on soil health and greenhouse gas emissions. This four year research project will enable the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices among UK farming communities as we work towards a net zero future.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67W5-B0J1-JB5P-J1BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1053\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 28, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It builds on long-standing collaboration between the UK and France to accelerate action on climate change and protecting the natural environment. Both governments are committed to deepening this further, and to increasing support for emerging and developing economies, as reconfirmed through the Joint Leaders' Declaration made at the 36th France - United Kingdom Summit, held in Paris in March 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today's event was convened by France's Minister for Higher Education and Research, Sylvie Retailleau, Minister for the Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion, Christophe B\\xE9chu, and Minister for the Energy Transition, Agn\\xE8s Pannier-Runacher, and UK Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Claire Coutinho, and Minister for Biosecurity, Marine and Rural Affairs, Lord Benyon. It brought together key figures from the private and public sector to identify how we can go faster to mobilise investment and financing to deploy climate and nature solutions in emerging and developing economies.</p><p>The event builds on the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum held earlier this year in Windsor, at which financial institutions and philanthropists announced a range of new investment platforms and initiatives, demonstrating their commitment to concrete actions to finance climate efforts in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p><p>It also follows on from the commitments on climate and nature made by the UK and France during the UN General Assembly this week in New York, and at the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact in June 2023, at which France and the UK launched a joint initiative to promote funding for nature protection and restoration. A key part of this was the creation of a new International Advisory Panel on Biodiversity Credits co-chaired by Chair of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew Dame Amelia Fawcett and Former Deputy Governor of the Banque de France Sylvie Goulard. The panel brings together existing initiatives and a diverse range of perspectives to guide the development of biodiversity credits, which are a new tool for raising private sector investment for protecting and restoring biodiversity.</p><p>Participants at the Forum held today discussed practical actions that investors and companies are already taking to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss and what more can be done to increase investment particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. Many of those attending made new announcements and set out how they are implementing their existing commitments.</p><p>The companies involved today made the following announcements:</p><p>Ardian, a French private investment house, and aDryada, a French biodiversity operator, join forces to launch the Averrhoa Nature-Based Solutions Fund, dedicated to large-scale nature-based projects, with a strong positive impact on climate, biodiversity and local communities. It will allow investments for a total of up to 1.5 billion.</p><p>Designed to accelerate the strategies of investors and companies in the protection and regeneration of nature and the fight against climate change, this Fund aims to build a portfolio of around 15 diversified projects of reforestation, afforestation, restoration of mangroves and wetlands allowing for the removal of c. 150 million tons of carbon. These projects will be based on the three pillars of climate, biodiversity and providing benefits for local communities, complying with the most demanding international standards and generating high-quality carbon credits.</p><p>Averrhoa Nature-Based Solutions Fund will deploy capital globally, mostly in emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>Amundi is taking a new step in the deployment of its strategy to contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and the investment into natural capital.</p><p>After engaging 385 companies in 2021 and 2022 to trigger improvements in integrating biodiversity into their strategy, Amundi is proud to join Nature Action 100, the largest global investor's coalition dedicated to foster action on natural capital, building on the success of Climate Action 100.</p><p>Amundi has already launched 2 thematic funds linked to the biodiversity thematic: one on the blue economy and another one to support the transition to a circular economy taking into account the biodiversity footprint.</p><p>Amundi is also working on a first fully dedicated biodiversity fund, which is to be launched in the coming months.</p><p>In 2022, AXA, Unilever, and Tikehau Capital committed to create a 1bn private equity impact investment fund. This fund is unique by its size, thematic approach towards regenerative agriculture, and partnership gathering AXA's specialised arm in climate adaptation and impact financing (AXA Climate), a large multinational consumer packaged goods company and an experienced fund manager in climate-related investments. They are now launching a 120 million investment in Biobest, a pioneer in sustainable crop management solutions, in particular in biocontrols that replace conventional pesticides. Biocontrols help farmers derisk their transition to regenerative agriculture practices during 5 to 10 years to restore the ecosystem on the field. With the investment, Biobest will acquire Biotrop, a Brazilian company active in bioinput, highly complementary to their own offer and impact generation.</p><p>Cool Earth, have pioneered unconditional grants to rainforest communities from Peru to Papua New Guinea and are regarded as the most effective approach, and are pleased to announce the roll out of a unique programme that provides regular cash grants to 2,000 households in the PeruvianAmazon putting decisions and control in the hands of the people who have most to lose from forest destruction and contributing to keeping 290,000 hectares safe.</p><p>Kering launched the Climate Fund for Nature at the COP15 on biodiversity in 2022. In partnership with L'Occitane Group, 140 million have already been committed, and new investors are expected to join this effort with the aim of reaching a total objective of 300 million.</p><p>Nine months after its creation, the Fund is fully operational and Kering is thrilled to announce the funding of a first project on the ground to protect primary forests in Peru (for an amount of 2 million) in partnership with a local NGO and indigenous communities. Various other projects are at an advanced study stage, including the restoration of mangroves and land in Latin America, West Africa and South-East Asia.</p><p>Finally, Kering will renew its financial support to the Museum of Natural History's endowment fund to assist them in their work on biodiversity certificates, which are intended to establish a science-based methodology for creating a voluntary market for biodiversity credits, similar to what already exists for carbon.</p><p>LVMH is pleased to announce that it will join the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA) as a Founder Member. The CBA was established in 2020 by His Majesty King Charles III (then His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales) to demonstrate, through Living Labs on the ground, a holistic approach to landscape restoration and value chain creation that works for people, for nature and for the planet. LVMH is already working with the CBA through its support of a Living Lab in Chad that produces cotton sustainably, using agroforestry systems and regenerative farming techniques in partnership with local communities.</p><p>Mirova is continuing to roll out its Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) fund with an investment of 8.5 million in Pamoja, an impact company specialising in sustainable land use, and a reference for sustainable macadamia nut production in East Africa. Pamoja supports nearly 6,000 small macadamia nut growers in Kenya in their efforts to promote sustainable agricultural land management practices. In Tanzania, Pamoja develops certified farms of macadamia nuts, under agroforestry systems. The investment will contribute to the development of Pamoja's projects in Kenya and Tanzania, with the aim of contributing to sustainable land management over 6,200 hectares of land and reaching 13,000 local smallholder farmers. Mirova is a mission-driven, B Corp certified asset manager 100% dedicated to sustainable investing.</p><p>Safaricom, a Kenyan telecom operator and an associate business in Vodafone Group, will invest KES 15-20 billion (~96 - 128 million) into a major environmental improvement programme. The company intends to reduce its CO2 emissions by accelerating the roll-out of more energy efficient fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-building broadband to customers; to increase the usage of solar energy to power its network; to reduce plastic usage in its store network; and to increase the recycling of electronic waste, including redundant customer handsets. Safaricom has secured the largest Sustainability Linked Loan ever undertaken in East Africa. The funding was provided by a consortium of four banks: Standard Chartered Bank; Stanbic Bank; ABSA Bank; and KCB Bank.</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, is in the process of partnering with the Natural Capital Investment Alliance (NCIA). This collaboration aims to advance the Terra Carta's mission of prioritising nature, people and the planet at the forefront of global value creation. Furthermore, Tikehau Capital announces the first investment of its 1bn private equity impact strategy dedicated to regenerative agriculture and the launch of the second vintage of its decarbonisation strategy, which aims to mobilise between 2 and 3 billion. The first vintage, launched in 2018, successfully raised 1.4 billion and became one of the largest private equity vehicles exclusively committed to empowering companies that are at the forefront of efforts to decarbonise the economy.</p><p>This is in addition to recent pledges and initiatives from Forum participants showcasing climate and nature leadership:</p><p>Actis has pledged, through its Actis Energy 5 vehicle, $6bn of investable capital to renewable energy investment over the next 3 years, across 9 renewable energy businesses who will collectively deliver over 50 wind, solar and battery storage projects to both utility scale and commercial and industrial customers in Latin America, Asia, the Middle-East &amp; Africa, the US and Central &amp; Eastern Europe. A separate strategy will focus on transition in Asia including energy efficiency and sustainable mobility. Actis will build on its track record of delivering over 180 renewable energy projects across 35 countries over the last 20 years. With sustainability integral to Actis' investment strategy, Actis continues to focus on a just energy transition - transformation for communities, investors and planet.</p><p>This year, both the International Development Finance Club (IDFC) - the group of 26 national and regional development banks from all over the world, and AFD Group - the French development bank and IDFC chair - announced record high levels of climate and biodiversity finance.</p><p>IDFC members reported a record high of 288 billion USD in total green finance commitments in 2022, a 29% increase from 2021, of which 32 billion USD were allocated to adaptation finance, a 52% increase from 2021. Cumulatively, green finance commitments by IDFC members surpassed 1.5 trillion USD since the Paris Agreement in 2015.</p><p>With 6.9 billion in 2022 of climate finance approved in developing countries and Overseas France, AFD Group reached a new record level too, which makes the Group one of the main international climate finance providers.</p><p>Bank of America recently made an investment in responsAbility's Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Fund, which provides long-term debt to innovative businesses in the food value chain in emerging markets. The fund could potentially transform 300,000 hectares to climate-smart practices, drive sustainable land use and reduce about 8 million tons of GHG emissions. It builds on other ways that Bank of America is deploying capital into blended finance vehicles focusing on natural capital. Previously, Bank of America also committed to Bamboo Capital's Agri-Business Capital (ABC) Fund and the InsuResilience Debt Fund, both driving private capital to largely underserved segments of small agricultural holders and farmers in developing countries. Each of these funds is addressing issues of land use, biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions while creating sustainable food supply, jobs and economic benefits as well as climate resilience for local communities.</p><p>Egis, a global consultancy, construction engineering, and operations firm, allocates 38% of its R&amp;D budget to climate action and biodiversity conservation. Through nature-based solutions like Soil.is, Egis is assisting countries such as C\\xF4te d'Ivoire and Congo to diagnose soil health and implement approaches to boost carbon sequestration around major infrastructure. Its Seaboost initiative has aided the Philippines to mitigate flood risk whilst safeguarding local populations and biodiversity. These innovations underscore Egis's belief that climate and biodiversity solutions must evolve hand-in-hand. By 2030, the company will integrate sustainable design practices in every project, part of a wider strategy that has already seen 45% of its 2022 revenue contribute to sustainable transition. Solidifying its commitment, Egis secured a landmark Sustainability-Linked Loan in 2023 to finance its growth in alignment with its environmental, social and governance objectives.</p><p>ENGIE is stepping up its engagement for climate. Firmly committed to achieve its Net Zero Ambition worldwide by 2045, it will reach Net Zero in 4 countries as early as 2030. To reach this target, it will invest 22-25bn between 2023 and 2025. Concretely, it develops energy transition projects in both developed and developing economies, such as the 150MW utility scale battery in the former Australian coalmine site of Hazelwood, a new 3GW windfarm as part of the Ras Ghareb consortium in Egypt and the recent acquisition of BTE Renewables in South Africa including 340MW of installed capacity.</p><p>Federated Hermes Limited is pioneering work directing public and private capital into nature while targeting 80% alignment with 1.5C by 2030 across its public markets portfolio, through active engagement with over 190 companies whose market cap tops USD 10 trillion.</p><p>In late 2022, the firm announced the development of a UK Nature Impact Investment fund to invest in nature-based solutions across land, coasts, rivers and sea. With the UK government committing \\xA330 million, and with strong private capital interest, it is now committing to raising \\xA3400 million in the medium term.</p><p>Federated Hermes Limited also launched its Biodiversity Fund in 2022, devoting capital to companies globally that provide solutions around biodiversity loss or lead their sector on nature. Drawing on its partnership with the Natural History Museum in London, the fund has raised over \\xA350 million since launch and is now aiming to exceed \\xA3100 million of assets by the end of 2024.</p><p>Haleon is committed to helping break down social and environmental barriers that hold people back from better everyday health. Recognising the worsening impact of climate change on health, the company works with industry peers through the 'Climate and Health Coalition' to mobilise action. Haleon created 'The Clean Breathing Institute' to support pharmacists to give trusted advice to patients on mitigating the impact of air pollution on their respiratory health. The business has 1.5 degree-aligned near-term Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon reduction targets, which were recently validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. During its 2022 reporting period, Haleon reduced its net Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 41% versus its 2020 baseline, driven by steps including switching to 100% renewable electricity across the sites the business directly controls.</p><p>The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), the governing body of skiing and snowboarding, has established the FIS Rainforest Initiative and committed to investing in communities in Peru by supporting the charity Cool Earth. The deforestation project focuses on educating local young people to become tomorrow's successful farmers and protectors of the rainforest. By off-setting its total carbon footprint many times over through the Rainforest Initiative, FIS has become the world's first Climate Positive sports federation.</p><p>Pollination is a joint project owner in Delta Blue Carbon (DBC), the largest coastal blue carbon project in the world. Across two phases, the project will restore more than 4000 km2 of degraded mangroves, while further conserving an area of approximately 2000 km2, and will produce an estimated total of 244 million carbon credits. The project is underpinned by strong benefit sharing mechanisms across education, healthcare, economic development and gender equality, with approximately 60% of the revenue from carbon credit sales reinvested back into the local communities.</p><p>When combined, these are landscape - scale projects which aim to protect and restore the entire ecosystem and bring increased climate resiliency to the southern Sindh province, an area severely impacted by climate change in the floods of 2022. Quite simply there is no other successful restoration project in its class. The second phase, DBC-2, is currently in the fundraising stage.</p><p>The members of the Sustainable Markets Initiative's (SMI's) Financial Services Task Force have committed over $9 trillion to support the transition to net zero by 2030 (or sooner) and have already provided and mobilized over $2.5 trillion in capital as part of those commitments since 2020 to 2021. The SMI continues to work to align industry, investment and country roadmaps to accelerate the deployment of private sector capital with a focus on emerging and development markets.</p><p>Source: United Kingdom Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:697B-DSM1-JB5P-J1P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3045\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 25, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He noted that FAO addresses these challenges with a focus on transforming agrifood systems through science, technology, and innovation.</p><p>The climate crisis is currently threatening the productivity of agrifood systems, affecting the most vulnerable populations and exacerbating inequalities. Soil degradation, loss of water quality, and water scarcity are on the rise, limiting access to fertile and productive soils and water resources, and contributing to food and nutrition insecurity.</p><p>Integrated climate-smart land, soil, and water management technologies and practices are considered essential for improving efficiency and enhancing water and land productivity. The event highlighted innovations in re-carbonizing soils, improving soil health, and enhancing water use efficiency. Strategies for promoting integrated governance of natural resources and managing water scarcity were also discussed, with the aim of strengthening the resilience of agrifood systems in the face of the climate crisis.</p><p>For example, efficient water use, judicious fertilizer use, reduced pesticide use, and improvements in soil health could lead to average crop yield increases of 80 percent.</p><p>Sustainable management of ecosystems in source areas and upper catchments, such as mountains, grasslands, and forests, is also vital for ensuring a reliable and healthy water supply. Governance actions such as supporting innovative technologies like precision agriculture, remote sensing, and big data analytics could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of integrated soil and water management.</p><p>Working towards innovative climate solutions</p><p>The event featured a range of experts and notable speakers from different sectors and regions of the world who highlighted several innovations.</p><p>In a keynote speech, Rosa Poch, Chair of the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils, highlighted the recent FAO-hosted Global Symposium on Soils and Water, which aimed to find solutions for sustainable soil and water management and food production. Key findings and recommendations from the symposium include increasing public awareness, adopting sustainable practices, monitoring soil moisture, using adapted plants, and accounting for green water (the portion of water in the natural hydrological cycle that is stored in the soil and is available for use by plants) in national water budgets.</p><p>Malin Lundberg Ingemarsson, Programme Manager at Stockholm International Water Institute spoke about innovative approaches of restoring degraded soils which can bring synergistic benefits for food security, climate, biodiversity, and water availability. She advocated for a shift from a farmer-focused perspective on these issues to also include pastoralists.</p><p>Axel Schmidt, Technical Advisor for the Water-Smart Agriculture program of Catholic Relief Services mention three cutting-edge research areas: 1) Real-time water and soil information at scale through remote sensing, particularly focusing on root zone soil moisture, 2) Fast and cost-effective soil analysis, including handheld devices for on-site, hyper-localized information, and 3) The use of geospatial tools for identifying viable locations for rainwater harvesting.</p><p>Federico Truco Chief Executive Officer of Bioceres Crop Solutions said that integrating technology and business model innovations can contribute to regenerative agriculture and the preservation of native ecosystems. His company has engineered drought tolerance in soybeans and wheat using a sunflower gene, aiming to enhance rotational schemes for sustainable intensification of land use and improve water and carbon footprints.</p><p>Amarjit Basra, Director and Chief Scientist at OCP Group in the USA emphasized the need for disruptive innovations to drive significant yield enhancements in key food crops. He highlighted the emerging paradigm of doing more with less, focusing on highly efficient fertilizer formulations, such as controlled release or slow-release fertilizers, to improve nutrient use efficiency.</p><p>FAO and innovation for soil and water</p><p>To ensure global food security while conserving natural resources , the world needs to produce an estimated 50 percent more food by 2050 compared to 2012 levels.</p><p>FAO is harnessing innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and Big Data to transform agrifood systems and generate high-quality data for effective water and land use planning, policies, and investments.</p><p>For example, The Global Soil Partnership supports advanced tech for assessing soil health, moisture, and fertility to aid science-based decisions by farmers and policymakers.</p><p>The FAO's Global Agro-Ecological Zones framework offers a vast database of over 65,000+ geospatial data layers, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions about crop suitability, yield gaps, and sustainable practices in a changing climate.</p><p>FAO is dedicated to the UN Water Action Agenda, promoting cooperation, partnership, capacity development, and catalyzing actions, especially in research and development investment, to facilitate faster and larger-scale international actions.</p><p>(The Food and Agriculture Organization)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69G5-46P1-JB5P-J1N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 25, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Agriculture is at the heart of human civilization. And so, as Agriculture Ministers, your task is not simply that of handling one sector of the economy. You shoulder a big responsibility for the future of humanity. Globally, agriculture provides livelihood for over two point five billion people. In the Global South, agriculture accounts for almost 30 percent of GDP, and over 60 percent of jobs. And today, this sector faces several challenges. The supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic have been worsened by the impact of geo-political tensions. Climate Change is causing extreme weather event more and more frequently. These challenges are felt most by the Global South.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Friends,</p><p>I want to share with you what India is doing in this most vital sector. Our policy is a fusion of</p><p>'back to basics' and 'march to future'. We are promoting Natural Farming as well as Technology-enabled Farming. Farmers all over India are taking up natural farming now. They are not using synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Their focus is on rejuvenating the mother earth, protecting soil health, producing 'per drop, more crop', and promoting organic fertilizers and pest management solutions. At the same time, our farmers are proactively using technology to boost productivity. They are generating and using solar power on their farms. They are using Soil Health Cards to optimize crop selection, and drones to spray nutrients and monitor their crops. I believe this ''fusion approach'' is the best way to address several issues in agriculture.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>As you know, the year 2023 is being celebrated as the International Year of Millets. You will find a reflection of this on your plates in Hyderabad, with many dishes based on millets, or Shri Anna, as we call it in India. These superfoods are not only healthy to consume, but they also help raise the incomes of our farmers by using less water, needing less fertilizer, and being more pest-resistant. Of course, Millets are not new. They have been cultivated for thousands of years. But markets and marketing had influenced our choices so much that we forgot the value of traditionally grown food crops. Let us embrace Shri Anna Millets as the food of our choice. As part of our own commitment, India is developing an Institute of Millets Research as a Centre of Excellence - for sharing best practices, research and technologies in millets.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>I urge you to deliberate on how to undertake collective action to achieve global food security. We must find ways to build sustainable and inclusive food systems, focussed on marginal farmers. We must find ways to strengthen global fertilizer supply chains. At the same time, adopt agricultural practices for better soil health, crop health and yield. Traditional practices from different parts of the world may inspire us to develop alternatives for regenerative agriculture. We need to empower our farmers with innovation and digital technology. We must also make solutions affordable for small and marginal farmers in the Global South. There is also an urgent need to reduce agricultural and food waste, and instead, invest in creating wealth from waste.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>India's G20 priorities in agriculture focus on healing our 'One Earth', creating harmony within our 'One Family' and giving hope for a bright 'One Future'. I am happy to learn that you are working on two concrete outcomes. The ''Deccan High level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition''; And, the ''MAHARISHI'' initiative for Millets and other grains. The support to these two initiatives, is a statement in support for inclusive, sustainable, and resilient agriculture. I wish you all success in your deliberations.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68H3-MK51-JB5P-J26P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 20, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet despite our complete dependence on nature, its contribution -- for example, the water used to make your clothes or the soil in which your food is grown -- is implicit and largely invisible. Building an equitable, nature-positive future thus requires a new generation of principles-based and well-governed markets for ecosystem assets and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nature and climate stability are two sides of the same coin, and their fates are intertwined. Conserving and restoring biodiversity is essential for limiting greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, while uncontrolled global warming will destroy the planet's natural wealth. But efforts to decarbonise the global economy are not enough to prevent the exploitation of ecosystems. Today's climate playbook can be learned and leveraged, but not copied and pasted.</p><p>A new playbook is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and the Taskforce on Nature Markets was established in March 2022 to help write it.

Yet despite our complete dependence on nature, its contribution -- for example, the water used to make your clothes or the soil in which your food is grown -- is implicit and largely invisible. Building an equitable, nature-positive future thus requires a new generation of principles-based and well-governed markets for ecosystem assets and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nature and climate stability are two sides of the same coin, and their fates are intertwined. Conserving and restoring biodiversity is essential for limiting greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, while uncontrolled global warming will destroy the planet's natural wealth. But efforts to decarbonise the global economy are not enough to prevent the exploitation of ecosystems. Today's climate playbook can be learned and leveraged, but not copied and pasted.</p><p>A new playbook is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and the Taskforce on Nature Markets was established in March 2022 to help write it.

HLED principals discussed joint accomplishments and progress on the dialogue's ongoing workstreams since the third HLED Ministerial in Washington, D.C. on September 29, 2023. The U.S. delegation was led by Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Marisa Lago, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez, and Senior Advisor to the United States Trade Representative Cara Morrow. The Mexican delegation was led by Under Secretary of Foreign Trade Alejandro Encinas and Secretariat of Foreign Affairs Chief Officer for North America Roberto Velasco.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United States and Mexico share a powerful economic and commercial partnership that continues to grow. Mexico was the United States' top trading partner in 2023 with total two-way goods trade at $799 billion. Our countries rely on closely integrated supply chains to power our economies and strengthen our global competitiveness.</p><p>U.S.-Mexico engagement under the HLED complements and strengthens our dynamic commercial relationship. In 2021, the United States and Mexico relaunched the HLED to advance shared strategic economic and commercial priorities. The HLED provides a platform for the United States and Mexico to leverage their strong economic integration to foster regional prosperity, expand job creation, promote investment in our people, and reduce inequality and poverty.</p><p>The HLED has continued its work over the last six months under the dialogue's four pillars: 1. Building Back Together; 2. Promoting Sustainable Economic and Social Development in Southern Mexico and Central America; 3. Securing the Tools for Future Prosperity; and 4. Investing in Our People.</p><p>As part of the dialogue, our two governments engaged stakeholders to inform and advise on HLED workstreams and considered stakeholder recommendations in areas such as semiconductor supply chain coordination, commercial cybersecurity and ICT, workforce development, and border infrastructure and trade facilitation efforts.</p><p>HLED accomplishments over the last six months are highlighted in the specific pillars below:</p><p>PILLAR I: BUILDING BACK TOGETHER</p><p>The governments of the United States and Mexico have collaborated closely on initiatives to strengthen the region's supply chains and reduce the risk of their interruption in the face of possible threats in the current international context.</p><p>Strengthening supply chains and coordinating crisis management</p><p>- The United States and Mexico are coordinating efforts through a joint semiconductor supply chain action plan with the following objectives: 1) supporting the integration of regional semiconductor supply chains; 2) scaling existing activities in the region by improving the investment climate, and attracting new investments in assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP); 3) promoting the diversification of investment towards activities not yet present in the region or which could have an expanded presence; 4) fostering state and local-level dialogues to promote investments in the semiconductor industry; and 5) supporting workforce development efforts in the region's semiconductor industry.</p><p>- The United States and Mexico are advancing semiconductor workforce development through a community college initiative taking place during the January - May 2024 semester. This U.S.-funded pilot sent eleven Mexican engineering students to Mesa Community College in Arizona to pursue the Automated Industrial Technology program. The program will help catalyze further academic collaboration between both countries to train specialized talent in the semiconductor and ICT sectors in Mexico.</p><p>- In 2023, Mexico's Secretariat of Economy launched its Ventanilla \\xDAnica para Inversionistas (VUI) or One-Stop Shop for Investors to promote investment among business communities globally. The website provides relevant information to help interested stakeholders make informed decisions about investing in Mexico. In 2024, Mexico has promoted the VUI to technology investors and the U.S. semiconductor industry and plans to promote with state governments in Arizona, California, and Texas, to bolster the semiconductor ecosystem in Mexico.</p><p>- In February 2024, the Mexican Chamber of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technologies (CANIETI), with U.S. Embassy support, convened in Guadalajara, Jalisco the first of four quarterly semiconductor forums attended by over 160 participants. The forums catalyze dialogue among the U.S. and Mexican federal governments, Mexican states, municipalities, the private sector, academia, and other organizations to promote development of semiconductor supply chains in North America. The remaining quarterly forums will be held in Baja California, Chihuahua, and Mexico City.</p><p>- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is working with Mexico on a study of the country's semiconductor ecosystem funded by the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act International Technology, Security, and Innovation Fund (ITSI). This report focuses on the Assembly, Testing and Packaging (ATP) segment of the supply chain, and includes a comprehensive assessment of the industry in Mexico. The study will provide joint recommendations to foster the semiconductor ecosystem.</p><p>- In February 2024, Mexico hosted a two-day OECD Semiconductor Informal Exchange Network meeting in Mexico City, covering topics such as the semiconductor ecosystem, workforce development needs, R&amp;D innovation, and supply chain resilience.</p><p>Cooperation on Environmental Technologies</p><p>- On October 16, 2023, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) co-hosted a webinar on Challenges and Best Practices to address plastic waste and marine litter. Speakers from the U.S. and Mexico outlined national approaches to plastics and marine litter and showcased state level projects that aim to address plastic pollution and marine litter in the US-Mexico border region.</p><p>- On February 15, 2024, a workgroup of the US-Mexico Border 2025 environmental cooperation program hosted the first of two webinars on scrap tire management. The first session helped connect ongoing border wide work on scrap tire management by outlining state policies and initiatives, highlighting available resources, and providing a space for discussion to identify gaps, priority issues and opportunities for future work. The topics discussed in session one informed the agenda for the second session, which will focus on specific priority challenges and solutions. Over 100 virtual participants attended the first session.</p><p>Improving border conditions to facilitate travel and legal trade</p><p>The United States and Mexico continue to improve and expand border infrastructure, and to coordinate these activities through our bilateral border coordination mechanisms, including the Western Regional Binational Bridges and Border Crossing Group (BBBXG) in October 2023, and the January 2024, 21st Century Border Executive Steering Committee, and the Eastern Regional BBBXG meeting in March 2024. All meetings supported bilateral efforts to increase secure, licit trade flows across our shared border.</p><p>Recent accomplishments include the modernization and expansion of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry (POE) in January 2024; completion of the enhanced feasibility study for the modernization and expansion of the Bridge of the Americas POE in November 2023; the completion of the Program Development Study on the BIL-funded Brownsville Gateway project; and the start of southbound transit of empty commercial vehicles at the Donna POE. Additionally:</p><p>- The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) expects to conclude feasibility studies for the Santa Teresa POE in April 2024 and the Nogales DeConcini POE in October 2024.</p><p>- The United States signed a memorandum of understanding allowing project sponsors to move forward with the 30 percent design of the Otay Mesa East POE.</p><p>- GSA expects to complete the Environmental Impact Statement regarding a new commercial crossing at the Douglas Agua Prieta POE in May 2024, with the project design-build process starting summer 2024.</p><p>- Mexico's Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) reports a progress of almost 60% on the Mexican side of the construction of the new border crossing at Otay Mesa II. It is expected to be completed by September 21, 2024.</p><p>- Regarding Piedras Negras-Eagle Pass II, SEDENA reports a progress of 44% and expects to complete works by June 7, 2024.</p><p>- The Mexican National Customs Agency (ANAM) has concluded the necessary equipment installation to allow the crossing of empty cargo vehicles at the Rio Bravo-Donna International Bridge.</p><p>- Mexico's Secretariat of Infrastructure, Communications, and Transportation (SICT) expects to conclude the construction on the Mexican side for the second span of the Nuevo Amanecer (Reynosa)-Pharr international bridge by October 2024.</p><p>Partnership for the facilitation of trade in medical equipment</p><p>- The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) completed in November 2023 its public-private Medical Devices Regulatory Convergence (MDRC) project with Mexico, which provided training and technical assistance to Mexico's Federal Commission for Protection from Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) and other regulatory agencies of the Americas region.</p><p>- Under the MDRC, experts supported by USAID provided technical assistance, which along with other efforts, contributed to COFEPRIS' improvements in implementing Good Regulatory Practices as shown in the publication of its Regulatory Certainty Strategy for the Medical Device Sector in October 2023.</p><p>- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues collaborating with COFEPRIS, which met important milestones by becoming an affiliate member of the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) in November 2023, and an affiliate member of the International Medical Device Regulators' Forum (IMDRF) in March 2024. In February 2024, COFEPRIS published for public comment a new equivalence agreement proposal to increase the number of authorizations of medical devices by recognition of the decisions of regulatory authorities in other countries, strengthening regulatory convergence. These advances will help COFEPRIS align with international standards and international best practices.</p><p>PILLAR II: PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA</p><p>The United States and Mexico are working together to improve the livelihoods of the population of southern Mexico and northern Central America to mitigate the root causes of irregular migration through the creation of jobs and opportunities in the region.</p><p>- The United States and Mexico have been partnering to address the root causes of irregular migration in southern Mexico and northern Central America, since the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID) and USAID launched Sembrando Oportunidades, a strategic collaboration, in December 2021. This collaboration has built upon AMEXCID's successful Sembrando Vida and J\\xF3venes Construyendo el Futuro projects in El Salvador and Honduras and USAID's complementary youth employment and agriculture projects in Central America. As of December 2023, Sembrando Oportunidades in Honduras and El Salvador has benefited 3,300 farmers and young people.</p><p>- In late 2023, USAID and AMEXCID extended their work under Sembrando Oportunidades to Guatemala. In early 2024, USAID and AMEXCID concluded the capacity building training of AMEXCID's Sembrando Vida technicians in Guatemala on agri-business, good agricultural practices, and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>- USAID and AMEXCID cooperation will benefit farmers through AMEXCID's Sembrando Vida program in Guatemala. Field visits were conducted in February to identify municipalities for coordinated implementation of the Agricultural Innovation and Market Access Program. This activity is expected to begin in spring 2024.</p><p>- USAID and AMEXCID also institutionalized trilateral cooperation in Honduras with Global Affairs Canada (GAC). In October 2023, GAC conducted a training with USAID and AMEXCID missions in Honduras to improve gender approaches and increase the participation of women in regional value chains, and another training in January 2024 on gender mainstreaming in development projects. GAC also announced a $17.5 million (over 5 years) call for proposals for programs benefiting youth, and gender equality in Honduras. This project is expected to begin in summer 2024 and one of the objectives is to complement the bilateral Sembrando Oportunidades framework.</p><p>- In southern Mexico, USAID continues to work closely with state and municipal governments, small rural and Indigenous communities, and businesses to create jobs, sales, investment, and positive environmental impacts. Over the last two years, USAID mobilized over $33 million in economic development investments that advance HLED goals, improving economic opportunities to over 30,000 people in southern Mexico. In 2024, USAID is launching two calls for proposals for programs working with community development organizations to increase efficiency, product quality and access to markets. The programs aim to mobilize $10 million within three years.</p><p>PILLAR III: SECURING THE TOOLS FOR FUTURE PROSPERITY</p><p>The United States and Mexico strengthened cooperation efforts in the implementation of commercial cybersecurity practices and new technologies in telecommunications and ICT to mitigate risks related to these sectors.</p><p>- In April, the U.S. Department of Commerce in collaboration with SICT, convened a technical workshop on cybersecurity with Mexican government officials and industry to preview National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology's (NIST) new Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and approaches to implementation. The workshop was an opportunity to present and discuss government and industry efforts and perspectives on cybersecurity, as well as ways for organizations to develop their own cybersecurity framework. NIST's Cybersecurity Framework is based on existing international standards, guidelines, and practices for organizations to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.</p><p>PILLAR IV: INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE</p><p>The United States and Mexico promoted measures to develop and prepare the workforce to meet the needs that current strategic industries demand.</p><p>Workforce development in strategic industries</p><p>- The United States and Mexico continue to work closely to develop, deploy and expand initiatives to improve workforce training and readiness to support the semiconductor, automotive, aerospace, medical devices, ICT, agroindustry, and other strategic sectors of the regional economy.</p><p>- Mexico and the United States developed a comprehensive cooperative workforce development workplan outlining initiatives to be completed in 2024. These include:</p><p>o Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) signed in February 2024 a final licensing agreement with Arizona State University to begin an online pilot program on English for the Semiconductor Industry. SEP launched the twelve-week pilot program in March 2024 with an initial 5,106 enrolled students from the National Technological Institute of Mexico (TecNM by its acronym in Spanish).</p><p>o Since March 2024, the Government of Mexico, through the Ministry of Economy and the Mexican Ministry of Public Education, is coordinating a Binational Virtual Dialogue on competency certification processes that seeks to share and exchange experiences between certifying companies in the United States and Mexico's National Council for Standardization and Certification of Labor Competencies (CONOCER). The dialogue will take place in spring 2024 and will also include the participation of companies in the automotive sector from Mexico and the United States.</p><p>Source: U.S. Department of State</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BW0-02W1-DXMS-81VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 24, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Healthcare Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBEQTY4ODlFREI3NDFERkFGQjVGNjM4NjZFMEM4NEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA0RjRFQTA3RUI2NENCRDlEODAyNDZFREM1OTE1RDQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Tires</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0FCNUQ3OTRCNkUyNEQ5NDlDMUQ2RTZENThERTkwQkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkMyNTdFM0IyMjQ2NDQzOEEwNzc4NUE5RjExN0Y3RTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Yet despite our complete dependence on nature, its contribution -- for example, the water used to make your clothes or the soil in which your food is grown -- is implicit and largely invisible. Building an equitable, nature-positive future thus requires a new generation of principles-based and well-governed markets for ecosystem assets and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nature and climate stability are two sides of the same coin, and their fates are intertwined. Conserving and restoring biodiversity is essential for limiting greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, while uncontrolled global warming will destroy the planet's natural wealth. But efforts to decarbonise the global economy are not enough to prevent the exploitation of ecosystems. Today's climate playbook can be learned and leveraged but not copied and pasted.</p><p>A new playbook is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and the Taskforce on Nature Markets was established in March 2022 to help write it. The taskforce's findings and recommendations on how best to shape a new generation of markets that conserve, rather than destroy, nature, will be released at the regional summit for the Amazon rainforest alliance held in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil.</p><p>The need for such a taskforce reflects a historic pivot toward putting a price on nature. There is a big push, for example, to quantify nature-related risks and to require nature-related corporate disclosures. Regenerative agriculture is attracting growing interest, sharing the benefits of genetic resources has sparked vigorous debate, and biodiversity-credit markets are beginning to take shape.</p><p>Advocates of market-based solutions claim that these developments, coupled with policy signals, will eventually align the global economy with nature-positive outcomes. The planet's ecosystems will be saved, they argue, by rewarding businesses and governments that offer nature-related financial products and services and channel investment into restoring biodiversity.</p><p>Policymakers and corporate leaders have relied on the same approach to mitigate global warming, with mixed results. But climate change is more amenable to a market-based paradigm for two reasons: GHG emissions are easily quantifiable and verifiable, and green technology continues to attract huge amounts of investment. The natural world, on the other hand, has neither an equivalent to GHG emissions, which makes it difficult to price, nor an investable technological landscape, aside from an emerging cluster of nature-saving commodity-production technologies such as lab-grown meat and vertical farming.</p><p>Another fundamental difference concerns the role of indigenous peoples and local communities in preserving nature. Despite comprising less than 5% of the world's population, indigenous peoples protect 80% of the planet's biodiversity. Even well-intentioned market-based policies and instruments could undermine these stewards of nature, dimming the outlook for conservation efforts (and thus climate mitigation).</p><p>To be sure, market mechanisms can and must be harnessed to save nature. But, given these unique challenges, they will succeed only if their governance principles and operating methods are designed to promote equity and sustainable prosperity. The taskforce makes seven practical recommendations that could steer the global economy to a nature-positive pathway.</p><p>At the top of the list is a need for finance and economy ministers and central bankers to align economic and financial rules more closely with the goals of preserving biodiversity and supporting nature's stewards. When amending trade and investment agreements, international policy coordination through the G20 and other international fora must ensure that nature-rich low-income countries do not bear the brunt of transition costs.</p><p>Central banks and supervisors must also ensure that financial markets are aligned with nature and climate commitments. Those governing global finance need to be more proactive -- addressing the intermediate goals of financial stability and market integrity is not enough.</p><p>Governance of soft commodities markets, especially for agricultural products, must be revamped, given their outsize effects on biodiversity, the climate, and society. Such targeted actions should include measures to increase transparency, including full traceability, and to overcome the current regulatory disinterest in nature.</p><p>Anti-money-laundering rules need to focus more on environmental crimes such as illegal deforestation, mining, fishing, and wildlife trafficking. Legal investments in the agricultural sector, particularly in soft commodity producers, can unintentionally finance these crimes, which destroy nature and often fuel violence.</p><p>Given the unique challenges of halting and reversing biodiversity loss, and humanity's total dependence on thriving ecosystems, we need a new playbook for preserving nature. It can draw on current climate strategies while also pushing for more ambitious measures that are fit for purpose. This is especially important when designing nature markets to deliver equitable, nature-positive outcomes for people and the planet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG090820230001055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68X3-HHG1-JCH9-G54B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24135\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 9, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

He mentioned that the responsibilities of an Agriculture Minister are not only limited to handling one sector of the economy but extend towards securing the future of humanity. The Prime Minister noted that agriculture provides a livelihood for over 2.5 billion people globally and accounts for almost 30 percent of GDP and over 60 percent of jobs in the Global South. Underlining the challenges faced by the Global South today, the Prime Minister stated the impact of the pandemic and the worsening geopolitical tension disrupting the supply chain. He also touched upon climate change causing extreme weather events more and more frequently</p><p>Throwing light on India's contribution to the agricultural sector, the Prime Minister highlighted India's policy of a fusion of 'back to basics' and 'march to future' and said that India is promoting Natural Farming as well as Technology-enabled Farming. Farmers all over India are taking up natural farming now, the Prime Minister said. He further added that they are not using synthetic fertilizers or pesticides but their focus is on rejuvenating the mother earth, protecting soil health, producing 'per drop, more crop', and promoting organic fertilizers and pest management solutions. At the same time, the Prime Minister continued, our farmers are proactively using technology to boost productivity and gave the example of generating and using solar power on their farms, the use of Soil Health Cards to optimize crop selection, and drones to spray nutrients and monitor their crops. Shri Modi expressed the belief that this 'fusion approach' is the best way to address several issues in agriculture.</p><p>The Prime Minister noted that the year 2023 is being celebrated as the International Year of Millets and said that the dignitaries will find a reflection of this on their plates in Hyderabad as many dishes are prepared based on millets, or Shri Anna. Shri Modi informed that these superfoods are not only healthy to consume but also help in raising the incomes of farmers as the crop requires less water and fertilizer. Highlighting the history of millets, the Prime Minister informed that they have been cultivated for thousands of years but due to the influence of markets and marketing, the value of traditionally grown food crops was lost. Let us embrace Shri Anna Millets as the food of our choice, the Prime Minister remarked as he pointed out that India is developing an Institute of Millets Research as a Centre of Excellence for sharing best practices, research and technologies in millets.</p><p>Shri Modi urged the Agriculture Ministers to deliberate on how to undertake collective action to achieve global food security. He suggested finding ways to build a sustainable and inclusive food system that focuses on marginal farmers and strengthens global fertilizer supply chains. At the same time, the Prime Minister asked for adopting agricultural practices for better soil health, crop health and yield. The Prime Minister said that traditional practices from different parts of the world may inspire us to develop alternatives for regenerative agriculture. He emphasized the need to empower the farmers with innovation and digital technology and make solutions affordable for small and marginal farmers in the Global South. He also touched upon the urgent need to reduce agricultural and food waste, while investing in creating wealth from waste.</p><p>Concluding the address, the Prime Minister said, India's G20 priorities in agriculture focus on healing our 'One Earth', creating harmony within our 'One Family' and giving hope for a bright 'One Future'. He expressed happiness that work is underway on two concrete outcomes - The 'Deccan High-level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition', and the 'MAHARISHI' initiative for millets and other grains. The support for these two initiatives is a statement in support for inclusive, sustainable, and resilient agriculture, the Prime Minister concluded.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68H3-MK51-JB5P-J269-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 20, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Those businesses who get onboard early can capture major opportunities and build a competitive advantage, for instance, they are able to access green finance and enjoy relevant incentives thanks to regulatory support for green finance to facilitate a green economy.</p><p>On top of that, aligning a business to a net zero future also helps build a stronger brand, increase brand value, and improve employer branding to meet the expectations among employees and consumers.</p><p>He encouraged businesses to start working out their transition plan, beginning with setting a clear strategy and targets.</p><p>They should refer to the guidelines of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to set short- and long-term targets and adjust their business strategy to align with climate risks, he said.</p><p>They should consider rolling out emission reduction initiatives like reducing waste, increasing circularity and implementing energy-efficiency measures, redesigning products for lower-carbon materials and switching facilities to renewable power, and so on. In the long run, new, low-carbon business models should be developed with technologies, goods, and services of a sustainable tomorrow at its core.</p><p>In this net zero pathway, cooperation will be the key in driving businesses, especially those who are linked together in the same ecosystem/supply chain, to join hands in looking for win-win solutions that benefit not only themselves but the society as a whole, he added.</p><p>Many businesses have already had a green agenda in place and great progress has been made, such as Nestl\\xE9 with regenerative agriculture through the NESCAF\\xC9 Plan project.</p><p>Khut Quang H\\xFCng, head of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability at Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam, said currently nearly two-thirds of Nestl\\xE9's emissions come from the production of agricultural ingredients it uses. Therefore, the shift toward regenerative agriculture will help the group to greatly slash greenhouse gas emissions in the near future.</p><p>However, delegates at the seminar agreed that the transition to green growth is a challenging process, and much more needs to be done to achieve the net zero targets and a sustainable future for future generations.</p><p>HSBC's Evans said, in order to accelerate the transition of Vietnam, there is a clear need for the Government to have a thorough framework coupled with detailed policies in place after its green growth strategy as a springboard. The green economy transition requires comprehensive reforms in which the finance sector should be at its heart. Only with strong green finance should other sectors be able to step up.</p><p>At present, international funds for green growth, particularly in renewable energy, are still nascent due to the hesitation of investors caused by insecure electricity commercial contracts posing risk to project-based funding as well as the restrictions in regulatory and legal frameworks for refinancing existing projects. Much more needs to be done to create a hassle-free space to leverage international capital for national green growth.</p><p>In adition, delegates suggested the Government should have incentive policies to encourage enterprises to transform towards sustainable development.</p><p>Top 50 corporate sustainability awards</p><p>The seminar was followed by the Top 50 corporate sustainability awards ceremony that honoured 50 foreign invested, listed and non-listed enterprises that have contributed to sustainable development, environmental friendliness and social justice.</p><p>The awards also aim to contribute to promoting the trend of sustainable development spreading among the business community and Vietnamese society, raise awareness, and demonstrate how sustainable business benefits companies, the environment, and society.</p><p>Akzo Nobel Vietnam, Cargill Vietnam, GE Vietnam, Manulife Vietnam, Nestl\\xE9 Vietnam, Unilever Vietnam, Masan, Nam Long, Novaland, PNJ, Sacombank, the Pan Group, Vinamilk and H\\xFCng Thnh Land were among the winners.</p><p>The awards were assessed based on criteria such as stable growth (company size, average growth and its position in the market), sustainable corporate culture, corporate governance, environmental protection and the social responsibility of companies.</p><p>The programme received data and advisory from the appraisal panel including representatives of HSBC Vietnam, Deloitte Vietnam, FTI Consulting, Talentnet, the Institute of Circular Economy Development and experts from Harvard Business School. - VNS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664J-N0S1-DXMS-849Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 12, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We must encourage additional green stimulus, design carbon pricing schemes, reduce dependence on fossil-fuel intensive power, and attract private sector investors to large-scale renewable energy, sustainable transport, and clean urban projects, Subramaniam said.</p><p>To implement a green recovery, Southeast Asian governments need to identify sustainable sources of financing that will fund climate-friendly infrastructure investments and leverage green growth opportunities.</p><p>According to the report, financing approaches should include mobilising domestic resources through environmental and carbon taxes, reducing subsidies for fossil fuels, mobilising private investors by addressing risks related to green investments, and leveraging public and private finance through green funds such as the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility. Finally, strong collaboration among neighboring economies and new partnerships with various stakeholders should be forged to ensure benefits accrue throughout the region.</p><p>ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. - VNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65W3-PF91-JB5P-J4FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 8, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Through the AIM for Climate, we are collaborating with the U.S., and partners worldwide to tackle the climate impacts of food systems. This collaboration aims to mobilize governments and the private sector to deliver innovative solutions that can enhance food security while reducing the environmental impact of agriculture, said Assistant Under Secretary Alameeri.</p><p>We are proud to collaborate with the U.S. in this effort, and we look forward to highlighting the importance of agriculture innovation at COP28 in the UAE later this year. COP28 will be an ideal platform to emphasize the significance of adopting the latest agri-tech as a solution to our global food security and climate change challenges. We believe that this path will pave the way towards a more sustainable future for all, he added.</p><p>USDA Chief Scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young shared key USDA scientific breakthroughs at the high-level plenary featuring leading female scientists, moderated by Sweta Chakraborty, Chief Executive Officer North America of the climate-focused social media network, We Don't Have Time. Along with Jacobs-Young, the plenary included insights from women leaders in science- Sarah Kapnick, Chief Scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Ismahane Elouafi, Chief Scientist for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</p><p>Thanks to breakthrough research and innovation, we've been able to improve agricultural production and make progress on some of the world's most complex challenges, said Jacobs-Young. Our groundbreaking research and development will be critical to achieving an agricultural enterprise that is inclusive, productive, profitable, sustainable and resilient. Equitable access to science-based, data-driven information and innovative technologies is essential to creating a better world for us all.</p><p>Chakraborty encouraged sharing of authentic stories so that women in science can amplify their voices in agricultural policymaking and help ensure diverse gender, age, ethnic and geographic perspectives in shaping climate solutions.</p><p>The day's lunch session, hosted by the Gender, Climate Change and Nutrition Integration Initiative and supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, focused on the theme Innovation for Inclusive Impact: Women at the Heart of our Food Systems. Speakers included CropLife International President and CEO Emily Rees, USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman, Canadian Minister of Agriculture Marie-Claude Bibeau and UN Foundation President and CEO Elizabeth Cousens.</p><p>USAID is proud of our commitment and contribution to the AIM for Climate initiative as ambitious investments in climate-smart agriculture and food systems are critical to ensure future security in a warming planet and we're seeing real progress-but we also must make sure we're putting women at the heart of our work, said USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman. When women have the tools to succeed, they reinvest in their families and communities, creating a multiplier effect that promotes wellbeing, prosperity and stability.</p><p>During the afternoon session Call to Action: Investment, Innovation, and Implementation, Ertharin Cousin, former Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme delivered the keynote address. The session was co-hosted by the Business Council for International Understanding and the International Trade Centre.</p><p>To realize a more sustainable food system, our food must be grown and transported using more effective and climate-smart methods, noted Cousin. That means expanding farmers' access to better seeds and tools that will more efficiently increase the quality and quantity of their yields; increasing the use of climate-smart agricultural practices like precision agriculture; and investing in regenerative agriculture systems that will address the significant effects of climate change on our food systems. We have a real opportunity to take pre-emptive action to transform our agricultural practices and support a more equitable, sustainable food system that ensures environmental and human health as well as a financial return for our farmers and all actors across the food system.</p><p>Since AIM for Climate's inception, partners have increased investment to more than $13 billion, launched 51 innovation sprints, and expanded to more than 500 partners worldwide.</p><p>(U.S. Department of Agriculture)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68BC-P6R1-JB5P-J4TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 29, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I think the success was around just bringing likeminded people together.</p><p>For other councils interested in starting a similar project, local support is important, Mr McAinch said</p><p>I think there's a great benefit having someone local that can support private landowners in making positive changes to the biodiversity in their environment.</p><p>The project will be extended for another 12 months and will also run in City of Greater Bendigo and Hepburn Shire Council.</p><p>Source: Government of Australia</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6465-RVD1-JB5P-J1H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 30, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It increased its volume purchase of locally-grown coffee by 41 percent in 2021 over 2020, sourced from participants in NESCAF\\xC9 Plan projects as well as consolidators, smallholder farmers, and farmer cooperatives across Mindanao. -PNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:665T-WM71-DXMS-82SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 18, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It identifies five areas that support a post-COVID-19 recovery through greener development, namely productive and regenerative agriculture, healthy and productive oceans, sustainable urban development and transport models, circular economy models, and renewable and efficient energy.</p><p>This report highlights key policy priorities for Southeast Asian economies that can help ensure that both socioeconomic and environmental aspirations are served in their pursuit of economic recovery, said ADB Director General for Southeast Asia Ramesh Subramaniam during a webinar jointly organized by ADB and ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. While several countries in the region have begun to support a green recovery, more needs to be done. We must encourage additional green stimulus, design carbon pricing schemes, reduce dependence on fossil-fuel intensive power, and attract private sector investors to large-scale renewable energy, sustainable transport, and clean urban projects.</p><p>Without concerted actions to address the environmental crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, the region's long-term growth prospects could be constrained. A green recovery from COVID-19 is crucial to ensure an economically and environmentally resilient future.</p><p>Other policy options identified in the report include intensifying research on green technologies, encouraging women entrepreneurs to participate in green business opportunities, and managing biodiversity better through open and integrated data systems.</p><p>To implement a green recovery, Southeast Asian governments need to identify sustainable sources of financing that will fund climate-friendly infrastructure investments and leverage green growth opportunities. According to the report, financing approaches should include mobilizing domestic resources through environmental and carbon taxes, reducing subsidies for fossil fuels, mobilizing private investors by addressing risks related to green investments, and leveraging public and private finance through green funds such as the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility. Finally, strong collaboration among neighboring economies and new partnerships with various stakeholders should be forged to ensure benefits accrue throughout the region.</p><p>ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members-49 from the region.</p><p>Source: The Asian Development Bank</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65W2-V431-JB5P-J41N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 8, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Today we are confirming that we will support 22 collaborative projects in the first phase of the Landscape Recovery Fund. The opening of this fund complements the significant work already underway through Countryside Stewardship and the Sustainable Farming Incentive to support regenerative agriculture and promote soil health and financial resilience for farms.</p><p>The Landscape Recovery scheme is one of three new environmental land management schemes introduced by the Government, including the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which supports action at farm level to make agriculture more sustainable, and Local Nature Recovery, which will support action at local level to make space for nature alongside food production.</p><p>Each of the 22 projects covers an area of between 500 and 5,000 hectares. The majority involve groups of land managers and farmers, including tenants, working together to deliver a range of environmental benefits across farmed and rural landscapes.</p><p>Successful projects will now be awarded a share of around \\xA312 million in development grants to help them finalise their delivery plans.

This sector employs over 60 percent of Congolese, according to the International Trade Administration. \"What we need to do first is to put agriculture back in its place. It is decreasing, because we are a mining county, says Nicolas Kazadi, DRC's Minister of Finance, The ambition of the government is to turn things around, to make sure that agriculture and the agro-industry regain their place and to do so we need farmers, large and small, who use modern methods to reinforce their productivity\".</p><p>How to build sustainable agri-food systems is also on the agenda of European and African leaders in Brussels. Hunger and malniutrition remain rampant in many parts of the world. And developing new methods of agriculture will require significant changes.</p><p>\"There is a range of innovative practices that could really be made much more visible and accessible, explains Paul Walton, the executive director of the Africa-Europe Foundation,We know that in pockets across Africa and Europe there are fantastic areas around sustainable agri-food systems, the way regenerative agriculture is taking place, but they are less visible and less accessible to the kind of finance and sustainable support that's needed as well\".</p><p>And time is ticking. The worsening effects of climate change are being felt across the African continent, further endangering food sovereignty, and putting millions at risk.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64TF-9NC1-DXMS-825R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That is business ethics and business culture,\" he said.</p><p>In the context of global integration and competition, ethical requirements in production and business, consumer protection, environmental protection, green economy, and circular economy are being promoted. They have become new standards for entering markets, especially in developed countries.</p><p>Business ethics and culture both create new internal abilities and competitiveness for enterprises and are indispensable foundations for the sustainable development of enterprises.</p><p>A survey conducted by VCCI with more than 10,000 businesses nationwide shows that 56 per cent see opportunities from climate change. Of which, about 30 per cent said it is time to restructure and rearrange production, while 17 per cent said it is an opportunity to create new technology products and services and develop more markets.</p><p>Nguyn Quc Kh\\xE1nh, Executive Director of the Research and Development Division, Vietnam Dairy Products Joint Stock Company (Vinamilk), said: \"Vinamilk's farm system is an example of sustainable development. Practising regenerative agriculture at Vinamilk's farms, we use renewable energies such as solar energy and technology systems to reduce methane emissions.\"</p><p>V Th Kim Chi, Deputy Head of the Investment Promotion and Support Department of Qung Ninh Province, said Qung Ninh considers sustainable development an urgent task. Therefore, in its development strategy, Qung Ninh has changed the economic structure from brown to green.</p><p>The private sector plays an important role in mobilising investment to develop the green economy. Qung Ninh has piloted a public-private partnership model in implementing key transport infrastructure projects such as V\\xE2n Don airport and highways.</p><p>In addition, it has promoted administrative procedure reform and improved the business investment environment to create favourable conditions for businesses in expanding investment.</p><p>This is the first step in mobilising private resources to promote green growth and sustainable development, Chi said.</p><p>Besides that, to meet development needs, Qung Ninh has also approached energy sources for sustainable development. Instead of depending on the traditional material source of coal, the province aims to develop new energy sources such as wind power, solar power and gas power in the provincial development plan future.</p><p>Chairwoman of the Board of Directors of Deloitte Vietnam Ha Th Thu Thanh, Vice President of Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development (VBCSD), said that the trend of ESG practice is receiving more and more attention from the business community because ESG helps improve competitiveness, from helping businesses seize \"green growth\" opportunities, reduce costs and risks, as well as enhance corporate image.</p><p>According to Thanh, since its establishment in 2010, VBCSD has made persistent efforts to promote sustainable business in Vietnam. In the future, VBCSD will focus on building the ability to carry out ESG practice for the private sector and applying the Corporate Sustainability Index to corporate governance.</p><p>Speaking at the forum, Nguyn Hong S\\xF5n, Deputy Head of the Central Economic Commission, emphasised that the development of enterprises is also the country's prosperity.</p><p>He said it needs to improve the legal framework, national and local governance ability, and the business environment. Central-run and local authorities should also promote public-private partnerships and strengthen international cooperation to create all favourable conditions for sustainable development.</p><p>Meanwhile, enterprises need to renew their thinking, enhance competitiveness, and increase corporate value via sustainable business management practices. They should implement the Sustainable Business Index developed by VCCI, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:672K-G571-DXMS-803D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 12, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Could it provide inspiration for farmers battling climate change?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On a hot August day in 2020, Grant Shadden stopped weeding and looked up to the sky. A dark line of clouds was moving quickly toward him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shadden is the production manager at Red Earth Gardens, a 40-acre regenerative agriculture farm in rural Iowa. He's seen his fair share of severe storms tear across the US Midwest, but this one was different. He watched in shock as the wind ripped trees from the ground and lifted half of the barn roof into the air.</p><p>What he witnessed was a \"derecho,\" a category of thunderstorm with sustained straight-line hurricane-force winds. Flattening 10 million acres of crops valued at $11 billion (9 billion), it was one of the costliest thunderstorms recorded in US history.</p><p>Across the world farmers like Shadden are facing severe storms with increasing frequency, as well as changes in temperatures and rainfall that make growing seasons unpredictable. Agriculture also contributes to climate change, accounting for 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>Alternative ways of farming</p><p>To anyone looking out over the vast expanses of corn and soy that cover Iowa today, conventional agriculture may seem natural. But Shadden points out that a long time before the first plows broke the Midwestern prairie in the 1830s, Indigenous people practiced regenerative agriculture here.</p><p>When it comes to sustainable farming, Shadden believes a lot could be learned from Red Earth Gardens, which carries forward the regenerative approaches of their ancestors. The farm - which is situated on the Meskwaki Nation's Settlement, an unincorporated community on land the tribe purchased from the government in 1857 - focuses on resilience and has adaptation to the climate crisis as a core concept.</p><p>The farm combines a grounding in Meskwaki land use ethics with permaculture methods.</p><p>\"Conventional agriculture is about identifying something and then killing it, to get a yield,\" Shadden said, explaining how standard farmers seek to dominate the land. \"We're trying to partner with nature and cultivate and steward the soil and the water and the air.\"</p><p>Shadden kneels and sticks his hands in the dirt next to a line of carrots in one of the greenhouses that survived the storm. He reveals delicate white threads in the black soil - mycelium mushrooms, evidence of healthy soil - and enthusiastically explains how they provide vital nutrients to the plant's roots in a symbiotic relationship. By eliminating tilling, he's encouraged these underground networks to develop. They act as organic fertilizers and safeguards against fungal pathogens, reducing the need for fertilizer and fungicide.</p><p>On the farm, diverse species of crops and other plants that attract beneficial insects are planted close together. Tomatoes and carrots grow alongside a variety of greens, and nearby blackberry bushes form a natural protective windbreak. Cereal rye, which is green all winter, covers the fields in the offseason. Shadden said this \"companion planting\" means the farm produces more harvests on a smaller area of land. Besides irrigation, its only input is natural compost produced on-site.</p><p>Food security and independence</p><p>The farm is the cornerstone of the Meskwaki Food Sovereignty Initiative, launched in 2012 to preserve traditional Meskwaki agricultural practices, reducing the 1,400-member community's dependence on outside food sources and government support.</p><p>Stephanie BadSoldier Snow, a Meskwaki farmer, helped found the initiative and believes conventional farmers could draw inspiration from Indigenous perspectives on agriculture. \"Our ecological practices traditionally were designed to preserve and to mitigate the overuse and depletion of resources,\" said Snow, adding the value of these methods is often overlooked.</p><p>Standard practice in Iowa's conventional agriculture involves repeatedly tilling the land before planting, applying fertilizers and other products that pollute waterways through runoff, and growing vast monocultures.</p><p>Outside the settlement, Iowan farmer Robb Ewoldt grows corn and soybeans near the Mississippi River. He believes the conventional agriculture system that dominates Iowa needs to change. \"Our weather patterns are changing. There's no denying it,\" he said. \"We're seeing differences in the amount of rainfall we get. The extremes seem to be more extreme.\" In response, he's implemented no-till methods and cover crops - which reduce damage to his soil and prevent erosion in the offseason -across his farm over the past 15 years.</p><p>Financing agricultural change</p><p>Convincing farmers to drastically alter their current lucrative practices to follow in his footsteps will be a struggle, he believes. \"It's going to be kind of tough,\" Ewoldt said. \"Farmers have a lot of money and ... when farmers have money, it's hard to get anybody to change.\"</p><p>But tougher times appear to be on the horizon. In 2018, the US Fourth National Climate Assessment predicted yields and crop quality from conventional agriculture will decline over the next several decades due to climate variability and increased heat in the Midwest. The assessment recommended investment in changing practices.</p><p>Ewoldt sits on the Iowa Soybean Association, which recently launched a Soil and Water Outcomes Fund with the backing of major corporations to pay farmers who \"produce positive environmental outcomes\" like carbon sequestration. So far, however, the incentives are small, as are the benefits offered by federal government cost share programs. Ewoldt said for many farmers those incentives may not outweigh the costs of retrofitting a planter to function in a no-till field, or buying cover crop seeds every year.</p><p>Linking climate change to agricultural finance and safety nets for farmers is also crucial, because many benefits are realized only in the medium to longer term. Increases in yields from improved soil health, for example, can take years to accrue.</p><p>Last summer, Meskwaki farmers endured monthslong severe droughts only to be doused with heavy rainfall that couldn't penetrate the dry soil. Seasonal fluctuation is also making it difficult to know when to plant crops. The farmers at Red Earth Gardens are planting more natural windbreaks to protect plants and continue to grow ancient heirloom varieties of corn, beans and squash well-adapted to the region.</p><p>Snow feels confident about the future of their approach to agriculture, particularly given her people's history of forced relocation.</p><p>\"To be pushed out of a land and livelihood that you fully understood and were comfortable with and had to continue to adapt, each time that we were moved, that's what resilience is,\" she said.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:630G-D9F1-DXMS-8536-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1141\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 25, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
