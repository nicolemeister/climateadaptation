It is attended by delegations from eight countries: the Russian Federation, the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Tajikistan, the Republic of Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. All these countries are long-standing partners working together on environmental issues at the bilateral level and within the framework of international associations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conference will begin with a plenary session titled Environmental Challenges: A Path towards Sustainable Development, during which the prime ministers of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will speak about their countries' nature protection and environmental agendas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speakers at the expert session titled Keeping the Global Water Balance will be the ministers of natural resources, ecology and environment. They will discuss the influence of climate change on water resources and measures that must be taken immediately to minimise the consequences of climate change.</p><p>A themed session titled Ecotourism: The Calling Card of the Country will be devoted to regulating the anthropogenic effect on natural systems, the role of ecotourism in economic development, the creation and development of nature trails, the functioning of cross-border nature reserves and national parks, as well as joint projects.</p><p>The participants will also discuss the development of cross-border ecotourism, the conservation of specially protected natural areas, and the preservation of biodiversity, for example, the five countries' joint efforts to restore the population of snow leopard, a rare feline that lives only in Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p><p>Excerpts from the transcript:</p><p>Alexandra Suvorova (moderator, Rossiya 24 TV channel): Mr Mishustin will deliver a report, but first, I would like to take advantage of my position here and ask him a question. Considering all the environmental challenges humanity is facing today, do you believe any country can effectively address them alone?</p><p>Mikhail Mishustin: Absolutely not - it is impossible. This conference, with its high-level international participation, itself answers your question. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the heads of government from friendly counties, distinguished guests, and environmental experts who have gathered here in this magnificent setting - Manzherok in the Altai region. Together, we will now tackle the most pressing challenges in ecology and nature conservation</p><p>Alexandra Suvorova: Thank you.</p><p>Mikhail Mishustin: Friends, colleagues, good afternoon.</p><p>Mikhail Mishustin during the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>I would like to once again welcome everyone to the Altai Republic and the famous resort of Manzherok - a place of amazing and diverse natural beauty, as the local people rightly say. There are many equally stunning sites across other Russian regions. We actually discussed this over breakfast today. Someone asked me: Is this some new style? I replied: No. This is our style, now extending to Altai. Of course, all participating countries have their own remarkable and beautiful natural corners.</p><p>Eurasian countries are home to billions of people. Unfortunately, this has increased the burden on the environment in recent years. There is no doubt that if we want to preserve this natural wealth for future generations, we must work together to improve the environmental situation. This is crucial for people's health and well-being.</p><p>President of Russia Vladimir Putin emphasised: ...nature conservation cannot be successfully addressed by any country alone. This must be taken up by all countries, without exaggeration, by all humankind. This meeting provides an excellent opportunity to discuss a broad range of environmental issues. Equally important is outlining shared approaches to balance environmental protection with socioeconomic development.</p><p>The Russian Federation is deeply engaged in environmental initiatives across multiple bilateral and multilateral formats, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, BRICS, and others. Crucially, we must ensure that all agreements reached are implemented in practice as well as expanded to address other pressing challenges. Let me now highlight a few key priorities.</p><p>First, we must strengthen collaboration to improve environmental quality.</p><p>In Russia, we have launched the General Cleaning federal project, in response to Presidential instructions, to address accumulated ecological damage. Over the past six years, we have eliminated 185 unauthorised city landfills along with hazardous wells and abandoned industrial facilities. To date, we have also successfully raised and disposed of over 200 sunken vessels across the country.</p><p>Building on the President's initiative, we are now establishing a circular economy framework. Currently, more than half of all municipal solid waste undergoes processing, supported by the construction of approximately 300 integrated waste management facilities nationwide. The reuse rate for recyclables across key sectors - agriculture, industry, construction, and housing utilities - has risen to 10 percent. Looking ahead, we are committed to increasing this figure to 25 percent within the next five years.</p><p>Of course, we are ready to share our best practices with our friends.</p><p>Lean water management is another important track for us. We must ensure that our people can access clean water at all times.</p><p>The Russian Federation has about 3 million rivers with a total length of almost 12.5 million kilometres. There are also over 2.5 million lakes. There are vast freshwater reserves.</p><p>In keeping with the President's instructions, the Government also takes action to restore and reclaim rivers, water bodies, and to expand the network of hydrotechnical structures for ensuring flood and drought protection. We are building special water treatment systems for ruling out any water pollution with residential and industrial wastewater.</p><p>There are quite a few major and medium-size rivers in Russia flowing through neighbouring countries. We also work together on using lake resources. The total area of these cross-border water bodies is about 3 million square kilometres.</p><p>Of course, it is essential that we step up our cooperation for protecting them and to ensure that we monitor them and share data in real time, while also coordinating our flood control initiatives and ensuring that our research teams work together when carrying out their studies and surveys.</p><p>We have been keeping a close eye on the Caspian Sea's shallowing - these matters require our attention and result from global climate change. In this regard, one of the main goals, as we have been telling our partners, is to devise an effective long-term model for forecasting changes in the water levels of this unique and beautiful water body. This model would serve as a foundation for planning our economic activity and minimising the possible negative consequences.</p><p>Statement by Mikhail Mishustin at the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is already working on this agenda. Taking this opportunity, I would like to invite our foreign colleagues to join these efforts. Millions of people depend on the Caspian Sea and its state. Preserving it and ensuring its sustainable use is our shared responsibility and our common objective.</p><p>The same goes for preserving forests. In Russia, they cover a territory of almost 1.2 billion hectares, which is a fifth of the global forest acreage.</p><p>The Government has taken action to prevent it from shrinking. For several years now, the area of recovered forest has exceeded the territories where the forests disappeared or where removed. This is a very important indicator. To give you an example, last year the former exceeded the latter by a factor of 1.5. Since 2019, we have restored about 8 million hectares of forests.</p><p>We are introducing advanced technologies. By using drones, we can get updates on the damaged and dead trees in real time, as well as identify any damage quicker. Satellite imagery enables us to monitor natural forest regeneration processes. In this regard too, we are ready to share all these solutions and technologies with our partners.</p><p>The next track is also very important - it deals with the endangered flora and fauna. We must step up our intergovernmental efforts in order to better protect rare species. This is instrumental for preserving biodiversity.</p><p>Russia attaches a lot of attention to this topic. Our country offers state protection status to over 400 animal species and almost 750 plants. This republic alone is home to the Altaisky and Katunsky state nature reserves which are designate as UNESCO natural heritage sites. Our country has a total of over 12,000 specially protected areas.</p><p>Selected areas are being made accessible to travellers, provided they exhibit a responsible and considerate attitude towards nature. Pursuant to the decision of the Head of State, we are establishing the necessary infrastructure that does not disrupt fragile ecosystems.</p><p>The number of visitors to federal national parks continues to grow. Last year alone, it increased by 150 percent. Over 17 million people have now had the opportunity to witness pristine nature.</p><p>I believe this form of tourism holds tremendous potential, and I propose we develop it together.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>To successfully address environmental challenges and mitigate the consequences of climate change, it is vital that we combine the efforts of scientists and innovators across our nations. We must employ the most advanced technologies to monitor the state of ecosystems, air, water, solar activity, radiation levels, and wind patterns.</p><p>Russian researchers obtain such data in real time thanks to the extensive observation network of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Rosgidromet) and our domestic orbital constellation of 18 satellites.</p><p>Statement by Mikhail Mishustin at the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>For the study of Arctic natural processes, we have constructed an ice-resistant self-propelled platform named North Pole. This is a unique vessel - the only one of its kind in the world. It has enabled scientists to access high-latitude Arctic regions previously deemed unreachable. The data collected is now instrumental in improving navigation along the Northern Sea Route, a critical transport artery and logistics corridor.</p><p>Research in Antarctica is also underway. Last year, we inaugurated a new wintering complex named Vostok. This modern facility, located at the heart of the continent, was built in less than five years. Spanning nearly 3,000 square metres, it houses scientific laboratories, residential and communal spaces, energy centres, and technical units.</p><p>The studies conducted there hold substantial scientific value, offering insights into the causes of climatic shifts. We must, of course, enhance conditions for collaboration among our scientists so that such projects - including joint initiatives - continue to multiply.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>Environmental improvement and nature conservation remain at the forefront of the Russian Government's priorities. Our President, Vladimir Putin, has identified environmental well-being as one of the nation's key development goals. We will do everything necessary to achieve this objective. However, as I have stated earlier, no country can tackle such challenges alone. I propose intensifying our collaborative efforts in this direction - for the benefit of present and future generations.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Nikol Pashinyan: Mr Mishustin, heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan at the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude for the invitation to participate in this International Environmental Conference and to extend my appreciation to the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation for his hospitality and the high-level organisation of today's event.</p><p>It is symbolic that this critically important discussion is taking place in Altai, a region renowned for its natural beauty.</p><p>Heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Armenia is a mountainous country, with 80 percent of its territory comprised of highland regions. Our country is known for its diverse climatic zones - ranging from arid subtropical to alpine.</p><p>Armenia boasts numerous endemic flora species. Four national parks and three reserves occupy over 10 percent of the country's territory. Among these is the Khosrov Reserve, founded upon an artificial forest established as early as the 4th century as a royal hunting ground. The jewel of Armenia - Lake Sevan - is the largest freshwater body in our region.</p><p>The mountain ecosystems of our country are acutely vulnerable to climate change. Droughts, floods, and flash floods are becoming increasingly frequent. Although Armenia's carbon dioxide emissions are negligible on a global scale, our country is among those most severely affected by global warming.</p><p>The consequences of climate change manifest in accelerated glacial melt, reduced precipitation, landslides, soil erosion, and desertification. Water scarcity leads to diminished pasture and arable land productivity, as well as declining forest resources. In this context, we attach great importance to enhancing water resource efficiency, adopting innovative technologies, and implementing drip irrigation programmes.</p><p>It is for this reason that the Government of Armenia has approved the Climate Change Adaptation Programme for the Water Sector, covering the period 2022 to 2026. A new draft law on climate has also been developed in the Republic of Armenia.</p><p>The purpose of this draft law is to establish legal and institutional frameworks for formulating and implementing the country's climate agenda. In response to national needs and international commitments, the Government approved the National Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan and a corresponding set of measures for 2021-2026 in May 2021. Thus, we are defining the strategic parameters for adaptation and planning efforts on a permanent and ongoing basis.</p><p>Armenia welcomes cooperation among EAEU member states on the climate agenda. Eurasian low-carbon development programmes are equally vital.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Placing high importance on biodiversity conservation, Armenia is implementing programmes to restore populations of wild animals.</p><p>The programme to revive the Caucasian leopard population, carried out jointly with the World Wildlife Fund since 2002, has yielded tangible results. Permanent habitation of this species within Armenia's borders - along with the birth of cubs - has already been recorded, signalling the establishment of a stable habitat and food supply for the Caucasian leopard.</p><p>In collaboration with the Fund, we are also executing a programme to restore the Caucasian red deer population in the Dilijan Reserve.</p><p>Armenia supports the agenda of mountainous countries within the UN framework. We actively participate in the Group of Friends of Mountainous Countries at the UN, an initiative launched by Kyrgyzstan. Additionally, we have joined the Kyrgyz side's initiative, the Mountain Partnership Group, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties. We hope this group will become an active participant in the negotiation processes of climate conferences, and to this end, we stand ready to facilitate the development of a requisite agenda within the group.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>As you are aware, the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP17) on Biological Diversity will be held in Armenia in October 2026. We anticipate the participation of high-level delegations from your countries, as well as representatives from academic and expert communities, in COP17 proceedings.</p><p>As the chair and host nation, Armenia will spare no effort to foster productive dialogue, bridge differences among parties, and adopt balanced, substantive decisions that account for the interests and priorities of all stakeholders.</p><p>We are confident that together, we can make a substantial contribution to global efforts in preserving biodiversity and promoting the sustainable use of natural resources - in the spirit of shared responsibility for our planet.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Turchin: Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Belarus Alexander Turchin</p><p>First and foremost, allow me to extend my gratitude to the organisers of this conference and to the leadership of the Republic of Altai for their invitation and the opportunity to discuss environmental agenda issues in such a picturesque and symbolic location. The nature of Altai serves as a reminder of how fragile and beautiful is our planet is, and how crucial it is to unite our efforts in preserving it.</p><p>With each passing year, the international community devotes increasing attention to environmental protection and maintaining the planet's ecological integrity. This is not merely a matter of following trends but rather a commitment to establishing a robust model of sustainable socio-economic development. In Belarus, environmental protection is a cornerstone of state policy and is approached in a comprehensive manner. It encompasses all natural components, ecosystems, as well as the economy, healthcare, science, education, and other spheres of state and human activity.</p><p>In accordance with the national security concept of the Republic of Belarus, the primary national interests within the environmental sphere include ecologically oriented socio-economic development of the state, preservation of a favourable environment, and adaptation to climate change.</p><p>Thus, we regard the conservation of natural resources and the minimisation of anthropogenic impact on climate change as strategic imperatives upon which the well-being of future generations depends. In our country, the principles of green and circular economies are enshrined in legislation through the National Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Republic of Belarus until 2040, as well as other long- and medium-term planning documents.</p><p>One of the key priorities in the environmental agenda for the near future is maximising the reintegration of waste into secondary circulation. Today, the republic achieves a waste utilisation rate of approximately 90 percent for industrial waste (excluding large-tonnage waste), while the rate for municipal solid waste stands at around 40 percent.</p><p>In May 2025, the President of our country set the task of establishing a comprehensive waste management system covering all types of waste, alongside the creation of an automated tracking system for waste volumes - from generation to reuse - at every stage. In the near future, Belarus will adopt a strategy for the management of industrial and consumer waste.</p><p>This strategy will serve as the foundational document, outlining in detail the objectives and long-term development of the waste management system, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that, by 2040, no less than 90 percent of industrial and consumer waste is utilised.</p><p>Water resources, as a natural asset, constitute a national treasure for all nations. Belarus is home to over 20,000 watercourses and more than 10,000 lakes.</p><p>National policy concerning water protection and usage is founded on principles aimed at improving the ecological state of surface water bodies while preventing pollution, depletion, and degradation. The assessment of rational water resource usage is conducted based on the integration of circulating and reused water supply systems into industrial processes.</p><p>The Republic of Belarus has successfully ensured economic growth while decreasing water consumption, achieving a 24 percent reduction in water extraction since 2000. Through timely modernisation and upgrade of municipal treatment facilities, discharges of insufficiently treated wastewater have decreased by a factor of 7.8 over the past 20 years, now representing less than 0.2 percent of total wastewater entering surface waters.</p><p>On air quality, the country maintains rigorous standards through an ever-expanding monitoring network covering all industrial cities, with continuous improvements to both coverage and technology.</p><p>Belarus has implemented an automated environmental monitoring system that aggregates real-time data from air quality stations and industrial emissions sensors. This system streams information directly to regional offices of the Ministry of Natural Resources, enabling immediate action against regulatory violations.</p><p>Our commitment to international climate obligations remains unwavering. Under the Paris Agreement, Belarus pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 40 percent by 2030 (against 1990 levels) - a target we have already surpassed. We are now advancing toward an even more ambitious goal: deeper emissions cuts by 2035.</p><p>Belarus has made significant strides in renewable energy adoption, with wind, hydro, solar, and biogas now contributing 7.3 percent of total heat and electricity generation.</p><p>The transition to electric transport is accelerating nationwide. In 2024 alone, the number of electric cars surged by a factor of 3,4. In Minsk, electric public transport already accounts for over 40 percent of the fleet, with its share climbing steadily.</p><p>Belarus' network of specially protected natural areas forms a robust foundation for environmental conservation. Over the past decade, we have made significant progress in expanding these protected areas, achieving some tangible outcomes. Our system now encompasses 1,355 designated natural areas covering nearly 2 million hectares (representing 9.2 percent of the nation's total territory) through sustained, systematic efforts.</p><p>In closing, Belarus' systematic efforts have earned us 32nd place out of 180 countries on the Environmental Performance Index ranking - a notable achievement, but not a reason to pause our progress. We remain committed to advancing our environmental targets and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources.</p><p>We stand ready to actively shape the green agenda within the CIS and pursue joint projects with our partners in the CIS and across other integration associations.</p><p>Thank you. I wish all participants productive discussions and rewarding outcomes from this conference. Thank you.</p><p>Olzhas Bektenov: Mr Mikhail Mishustin, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Olzhas Bektenov</p><p>First and foremost, allow me to sincerely thank the Russian side for their warm welcome, traditional hospitality and the excellent organisation of today's event.</p><p>We live in an era of rapid technological progress and global challenges. Alongside achievements in the economy and social development, environmental protection has become an increasingly pressing issue.</p><p>Environmental security is not just part of the international green agenda; it is a vital condition for the sustainable development of any country. The conservation of natural resources, ensuring access to clean air and water, as well as the frugal use of available resources, are top priorities that directly impact the wellbeing of current and future generations.</p><p>With this in mind, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has launched the Taza Kazakstan (Clean Kazakhstan) initiative, aimed at fostering a culture of environmental responsibility and care for nature and the land. As part of this initiative, large-scale clean-up efforts, tree-planting drives and other environmental campaigns are being held systematically across the country.</p><p>Importantly, Taza Kazakstan is not a one-time project. It is a continuous effort to transform public attitudes toward cleanliness, urban and rural aesthetics, and environmental stewardship. Today, the initiative has grown into a large-scale movement and an integral part of daily life for the people of Kazakhstan, influencing both individual values and the development of public spaces and the natural environment.</p><p>In parallel, the Government is undertaking efforts to modernise environmental legislation and introduce advanced nature conservation technologies. A real-time emission monitoring system is being introduced as part of the digitalisation of environmental oversight. This system enables the timely tracking of environmental impact and prompt responses to abnormal occurrences.</p><p>Kazakhstan is also actively participating in global efforts to preserve biodiversity. New protected natural areas are being created and existing ones expanded. Work is underway to establish a biodiversity conservation fund, with the primary goal of protecting and restoring wildlife populations, including the Caspian seal, the greater flamingo and many other species.</p><p>Special attention is being given to rare and endangered species, such as the Bukhara deer, kulan, argali sheep, and goitered gazelles. Kazakhstan is also working on the reintroduction of the Turan tiger and Przewalski's horse. Thanks to the measures being implemented, we are seeing encouraging growth in populations of the snow leopard and the saiga antelope.</p><p>One of the most urgent issues facing Kazakhstan is the environmental and economic impact of changes to water bodies. Since the early 2000s, the Caspian Sea has experienced a steady decline in water levels. To study this and related issues, the Kazakh Research Institute of the Caspian Sea was established. Unfortunately, expert forecasts remain disturbing. Coordinated and decisive action by all Caspian littoral states is urgently needed to preserve this unique body of water. Kazakhstan is also taking steps to partially restore the Aral Sea and its surrounding ecosystems.</p><p>In this context, Kazakhstan is undertaking initiatives to fortify the Kok-Aral Dam, restore the Syr Darya Delta, support the region's fishing industry, and embark on extensive afforestation of the Aral Sea bed. Last year, Kazakhstan assumed the leadership of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. Under our nation's chairmanship, a series of international events have been convened in the Aral region. These include the establishment of new monitoring centres, the launch of collaborative programmes to preserve the unique ecosystems of the Aral area, and expeditions involving leading international environmentalists and biodiversity specialists.</p><p>The initiatives being executed underscore the readiness of Central Asian states to engage in collaborative action to address environmental challenges. Within the global water agenda, one of the most urgent issues is the preservation of glaciers. According to expert forecasts, the volume of glaciers in Central Asia is projected to decline significantly by the year 2100.</p><p>In this regard, at the 2024 One Water Summit in Riyadh, the President of Kazakhstan proposed the Water Towers Partnership initiative. Its objective is to systematise support for glaciological science by uniting the efforts of global research centres to study glacier protection. It is important to acknowledge the contributions of the UNESCO-affiliated Central Asian Regional Glaciological Centre, based in Almaty.</p><p>The centre has consolidated regional research and serves as a scientific platform for assessing the impact of global climate change on mountain ice masses. Kazakhstan has enacted institutional reforms in water management, now centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation. Key priorities are outlined in the Water Resource Management Development Concept and the new Water Code. These strategic documents are founded on principles of conservation and sustainable water use, the adoption of water-saving technologies, ecosystem protection, and climate change adaptation.</p><p>We stand ready to implement joint interstate hydraulic projects, ranging from regulated reservoirs and canals to monitoring stations and automated water accounting systems. Kazakhstan's participation in developing the promenade around Lake Manzherok has been an excellent opportunity to contribute to the shared environmental agenda. Symbolically, Altai - the cradle of Turkic civilisation - was chosen as the venue for the inaugural session of this International Environmental Conference.</p><p>Preserving the natural heritage of this unique region is not merely an environmental imperative but also a vital component of cultural and humanitarian cooperation between our nations.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>Despite emerging natural and climatic challenges, Kazakhstan remains committed to resolving them through mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations. We are prepared to share our experience and work in a spirit of partnership.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, I would like to invite you to the regional environmental summit, to be held in Kazakhstan in 2026.</p><p>I am confident it will serve as a logical continuation of our efforts and define new avenues for collaboration.</p><p>Once again, I thank the organisers of this event and extend my best wishes to all conference participants.</p><p>Adylbek Kasymaliev: Mr Mishustin,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister - Head of the Presidential Administration of Kyrgyzstan Adylbek Kasymaliev</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>Conference participants,</p><p>First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you, Mr Mishustin, for your traditional hospitality and proposal to hold this international conference.</p><p>The conference is dedicated to environmental problems which cause growing concern across almost the entire world.</p><p>It is deeply symbolic that we have gathered in the Altai Republic, a region renowned for its unique natural beauty, majestic mountains, pristine rivers, and rich cultural heritage. This land offers valuable experience in preserving biodiversity and caring for natural resources, an experience that matters not only for this region but for the entire planet.</p><p>Today, environmental issues such as climate change, eroding biodiversity and pollution, require urgent and coordinated action at the international level. Only by working together can we find fair and effective solutions that will preserve our ecosystems for future generations.</p><p>Esteemed conference participants,</p><p>Kyrgyzstan has a rich and diverse natural heritage. Its highlands, glaciers, pastures, and lakes form unique ecosystems. Our country is home to about 2 percent of all plant species and over 3 percent of animal species on the planet: more than 26,000 species, many of them endemic; with 209 of them listed in the Red Data Book of Kyrgyzstan.</p><p>Like mountainous areas in many parts of the world, Kyrgyzstan's ecosystems are under severe pressure from climate change. Over the past seven decades, glaciers have shrunk by 16 percent, leading to an increase in natural disasters such as mudflows, landslides, and floods, and disrupting water and energy balances.</p><p>According to World Bank estimates, water shortages in the Central Asian region may reach 20-30 percent by 2050. In this regard, Kyrgyzstan prioritises joint efforts to strengthen climate resilience. We have established a system of glacier monitoring across the Northern, Central, and Inner Tien Shan, the Issyk-Kul Basin, and the Pamir-Alai, with key sites designated for continuous observation. Within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and despite our comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions, Kyrgyzstan has voluntarily committed to reducing emissions by 16 percent by 2030, and, with the support of international donors, by up to 44 percent.</p><p>We have also adopted a concept of carbon neutrality by 2050. In this context, it must be highlighted that the states responsible for 80 percent of emissions must help ensure climate justice, including providing financing and technologies to low-emission countries.</p><p>Esteemed participants,</p><p>Kyrgyzstan has been promoting the mountain agenda on the world arena for over 20 years. We have initiated a dialogue on mountains and climate change under the UN Framework Convention. We appreciate the countries' support for our initiative, including from the Russian Federation.</p><p>At the Kyrgyz Republic's initiative, the 77th session of the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on Sustainable Mountain Development.</p><p>This past April Bishkek held the Global Mountain Dialogue conference attended by 50 countries from Europe, Asia, America and Africa, and 29 international organisations. Given the global climatic processes, we have been promoting the Declaration on Climate Change, Mountains and Glaciers, which has so far been supported by 21 states, including the Russian Federation.</p><p>We are going to hold the Second Mountain Summit Bishkek +25 in 2027. I will avail myself of this opportunity to invite you to take part in that event and support our global mountain dialogue.</p><p>In 2024, at the Kyrgyz Republic's initiative, the United Nations proclaimed October 23 International Day of the Snow Leopard as a reminder of the importance to preserve its population. Given that the snow leopard is a symbol of mountain ecosystems' health, we are undertaking some active measures. Thus, we have adopted a presidential decree on the snow leopard as a national symbol and worked out a government strategy for its protection. Just a month ago Cholpon Ata hosted the ninth meeting of the committee of the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Programme involving 12 countries of its habitat, international partners and experts.</p><p>Thanks to the support measures, the current snow leopard population in Kyrgyzstan exceeds 500 animals. I want to underscore the fruitful cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Altai in preserving the snow leopard. In March 2025, the Snow Leopard centre in the Altai Republic received three snow leopards as an important step in reintroducing and improving the population. That was not just a symbolic act but a contribution to the sustainability of the Altai-Sayan region's ecosystem.</p><p>In general, starting from 2019, we together with our international partners have implemented over 10 joint projects in protecting biodiversity, laying nature trails and mounting expeditions. Kyrgyzstan has made two ecological corridors. The first one is Chatkal and the second is Ak Ilbirs.</p><p>With a view to preserve the biodiversity in Central Asia, we suggest considering creation of transborder ecological corridors extending to adjacent countries. Transborder ecological corridors will not only help preserving the biodiversity but will also open new opportunities for sustainable development, including in the ecotourism.</p><p>At present, to maintain biodiversity in Kyrgyzstan, a network of 96 specially protected natural territories has been established and is operational, covering a total area of over 2 million hectares.</p><p>Kyrgyzstan also regards ecotourism as one of the priority areas for ecologically and economically balanced growth. Last year, the country welcomed 8.9 million tourists, of whom more than 20 percent specifically chose ecotourism routes. The most popular destinations include trekking, ethno-tourism, birdwatching, as well as horseback and cycling routes in mountainous regions.</p><p>At the same time, ecotourism cannot develop without proper protection of natural areas from pollution, primarily from plastic products. Plastic waste poses a serious threat to vulnerable ecosystems, including Issyk-Kul and the fragile mountainous regions of the Tien Shan. In this regard, restrictions were introduced in 2023 on the circulation of polymer film bags and certain plastic products in the Issyk-Kul resort area, and since January of last year - on specially protected natural and biosphere territories.</p><p>From 2027, a complete ban is planned on single-use plastic items that cannot be recycled. The Kyrgyz Republic is open to exchanging expertise in plastic waste management, adopting recycling technologies, developing infrastructure for waste collection and disposal, and establishing joint cross-border environmental standards.</p><p>Greening plays a crucial role in the ecological well-being of any region. Amid climate change and increasing air pollution, tree planting and the expansion of green zones have become priority tasks for environmental preservation and improving the quality of life for our citizens. Since 2022, under the initiative of President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov, the Jashyl Muras campaign - meaning Green Legacy - has been implemented.</p><p>Over the past three years, more than 29 million saplings have been planted. In total, the campaign aims to plant over 70 million trees. These are millions of small dots of hope on the map of our country that, with careful nurturing, will grow into forests and orchards tomorrow.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that joining efforts to protect the environment and preserve natural resources is the foundation of sustainable development and the well-being of our peoples. We must act today to secure a future where humanity and nature coexist in harmony. The Kyrgyz Republic is open to cooperation and knowledge-sharing so that together, we may build a world where nature is valued, safeguarded, and restored.</p><p>I hope that our discussions and productive deliberations today on the hospitable Altai land will contribute to the global efforts in addressing the environmental challenges of our time. Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Tajikistan Kohir Rasulzoda</p><p>Kokhir Rasulzoda: Colleagues,</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Let me first of all express my gratitude to the Government of the Russian Federation and personally to Mr Mishustin, for inviting me to take part in this International Environmental Conference. I believe that this forum will help consolidate our collective efforts to counter growing environmental challenges. These problems are transnational by nature and require coordinated, multilateral actions to be effectively addressed.</p><p>Turning to national priorities, I would like to emphasise that the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, fully aware of the importance of careful management of natural resources and their preservation for future generations, is making significant efforts to protect and expand them. This approach is a cornerstone for ensuring a sustainable economic and social development of our country.</p><p>In this context, it must be noted that Tajikistan has been actively promoting the water and climate agenda on the international stage for many years. The adoption of 14 relevant resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly, initiated by Tajikistan, has laid a solid foundation for achieving coordinated global water goals. These resolutions have also contributed significantly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals included in the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>The close connection between energy and climate change cannot be denied. We believe that developing green energy is a constructive step toward preserving the global climate. Today, Tajikistan generates 98 percent of its electricity from hydropower, ranking sixth in the world in terms of the share of renewable green energy in its total energy production.</p><p>By 2032, Tajikistan plans to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy sources, and by 2037, to become, in essence, a fully green country.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>Considering these priorities, it is particularly relevant to underscore that the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan pays special attention to climate change and environmental sustainability, as these issues have profound and multifaceted impacts on our natural resources: most notably, the melting of glaciers. Tajikistan's glaciers are a key water source for the entire region, with 60 percent of Central Asia's water resources coming from the territory of our country. At the initiative of Tajikistan, the UN General Assembly declared 2025 the International Year for the Conservation of Glaciers, and designated 21 March as World Glacier Day.</p><p>In continuation of the topic of international cooperation, it is noteworthy that in May Dushanbe hosted an International High-Level Conference on the Conservation of Glaciers organised on the basis of the UN resolution.</p><p>The conference's key outcome documents were the Dushanbe Declaration on Glaciers and the Dushanbe Call to Action, which urge UN Member States and interested parties to take specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in promoting and coordinating the global agenda for the study and conservation of the cryosphere and glaciers. It is also important that last August, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution declaring the Decade of Action in Cryospheric Sciences (2025-2034), an initiative jointly proposed by Tajikistan and France.</p><p>In order to further advance these initiatives, and recognising the importance of studying the impacts of climate change on regional glaciers, a regional glaciology coordination centre will be established in Dushanbe under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation in cooperation with other development partners. This will become yet another substantial contribution by Tajikistan to the global climate agenda.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>To underscore our commitment to the sustainable development principles, I would like to highlight that the political will of our country, outlined and supported in the annual messages of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, His Excellency Emomali Rahmon, confirms our national dedication to preserving natural wealth as both a priceless heritage and the foundation for sustainable progress.</p><p>Tajikistan's biodiversity is truly unique, comprising more than 6,500 plant species as well as a rich variety of wildlife, including rare and endemic species.</p><p>However, it is evident that climate change continues to affect the ecosystems of our region. Many species of wild animals and plants are now on the verge of extinction. One such species is the markhor, a rare wild goat species inhabiting several Central and South Asian countries. In order to safeguard and increase the population of this endangered animal, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in May 2024, at the initiative of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, declaring 24 May International Markhor Day.</p><p>Snow leopard is another emblematic species, unique for our region. To protect this majestic animal, the Government of Tajikistan has adopted the State Programme for the Conservation of the Snow Leopard for 2024-2028.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the Snow Leopard Rehabilitation Centre has been established in the Murghab district of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. Tajikistan closely cooperates with the Russian Federation and other countries within the snow leopard's natural habitat to exchange experience and coordinate efforts to preserve snow leopards.</p><p>For a truly comprehensive approach to environmental protection, it is crucial to not only take direct measures to preserve individual species but also to ensure sustainable management of natural resources. This includes fostering environmental education, creating new protected areas, and implementing restoration programmes.</p><p>As a result of these efforts, over the past 30 years the total area of protected territories in Tajikistan has increased from 3 percent of the country's territory to 23 percent.</p><p>Tajikistan National Park, which is the largest protected territory in the country, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to note that close cooperation and coordinated actions make it possible to address global environmental challenges more effectively, preserve the natural diversity of our countries, and ensure a sustainable future for our peoples.</p><p>I wish you all well-being, fruitful discussions, and success in your meaninful work. Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Abdulla Aripov: Mr Mishustin, heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>First of all, allow me to express our gratitude for the traditionally warm welcome and brilliant organisation of the International Environmental Conference.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that all the necessary conditions have been created for fruitful work and exchange of views on the issues on our forum's agenda.</p><p>Esteemed conference participants, all countries and the entire population of the Earth are now facing an environmental crisis causes by climate change, the loss of biodiversity, environmental pollution, and a growing number of natural disasters.</p><p>Taken together, this complicates the task of ensuring food and energy security and hinders access to water and natural resources. Climate issues are becoming a new obstacle to improving the living standards for the people and implementing national development strategies aimed at overcoming poverty.</p><p>Dear friends, we have been working at the initiative of President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev to implement large-scale reforms aimed at creating favourable environmental conditions for the people and the green transition.</p><p>Uzbekistan has declared 2025 the Year of Environmental Protection and Green Economy. We are working within a state programme to introduce green technologies and green economy principles. Our objective is to ensure a rational use of mineral resources, save energy and water, and improve public health. In addition, we are also implementing the Yashil Makon (Green Belt) national initiative proposed by the President of Uzbekistan.</p><p>Under it, we plant more than 200 million trees every year, aiming to increase the share of green areas in the republic to 30 percent by 2030. We are implementing one of the region's largest revegetation programmes within the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Since 2018, we have planted over 2 million hectares of the dry bed of the Aral Sea with drought and salt-tolerant plants.</p><p>This year alone, we plan to revegetate 250,000 hectares of land in the Aral Sea Region, including 115,000 hectares of the dry bed of the sea. In addition, we are implementing long-term strategic documents, including the Green Economy Transition and Green Growth Programme in Uzbekistan until 2030, and an energy saving concept in various industrial sectors.</p><p>Green energy is becoming a driver of economic growth in the country. We plan to increase its share to 54 percent by 2030, which will allow us to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by nearly 16 million tonnes.</p><p>We are working closely together with our partners within the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS). The UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region, which has been established to support social and environmental projects in the Aral Sea Region, has become a reliable platform for implementing relevant initiatives in the region.</p><p>We cement irrigation networks to save water. We have created an industrial base for the production of water saving technologies, which have been installed on an area of nearly 2 million hectares, or approximately half of our irrigated land. These measures have helped us save about 8 billion cubic metres of water last year.</p><p>We have established the Central Asian University of Environmental Protection and Climate Change Studies (Green University), where the first regional office of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for the CIS (Eastern Europe and Central Asia) has opened a representative office.</p><p>We invite researchers and relevant professionals to take part in the work of the climate residence at the Green University to conduct joint climate studies. The first International Climate Forum was held under the UN umbrella in Samarkand in April 2025. Uzbekistan has also proposed several UN resolutions in this sphere, including a recent resolution on the Decade for Afforestation and Reforestation.</p><p>All this is graphic proof of Uzbekistan's active role in advocating the climate agenda at the regional and global levels. Besides, we are paying special attention to the development of ecotourism, which combines recreation with care for the environment.</p><p>Uzbekistan has unique ecosystems, from deserts and mountains to biosphere reserves that are on the UNESCO's World Heritage List and on the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat.</p><p>In 2024, the village of Sentab in Uzbekistan was recognised as one of the Best Tourism Villages by UNTourism (formerly UNWTO), and Samarkand was promoted as a Tourism Capital.</p><p>We are actively implementing projects to create all-season and mountain ski resorts and also developing ecotourism. We invite everyone to discover the natural and cultural wealth of Uzbekistan.</p><p>Dear conference participants, Uzbekistan intends to increase its practical contribution to joint efforts to overcome the consequences of climate change. Our priority is to do everything in our power so the future generations live in a sustainable, safe and prosperous world. We firmly believe that the initiatives and proposals advanced during this conference will contribute to the cause of rallying the international community towards adopting effective decisions in the name of green and sustainable development.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Russian side once again for their hospitality and for organising this event. I wish all conference participants fruitful discussions and productive work. Thank you.</p><p>Statement by Deputy Prime Minister of Turkmenistan Nokerguly Atagulyev</p><p>Nokerguly Atagulyev: Mr Mishustin, heads and members of delegations, forum participants,</p><p>First, allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the Government of the Russian Federation and the Altai Republic Government for the warm and cordial welcome extended to our delegation. Special thanks for your kind invitation. We are truly delighted to be hosted in this land of the flourishing Altai Territory.</p><p>The beauty of this untouched nature leaves an unforgettable impression. Today's nature conservation forum is highly relevant given the growing environmental challenges and their impact on people's lives and our planet as a whole. Environmental diplomacy and sustainable development remain undoubtedly effective tools for strengthening international cooperation and trust among states.</p><p>Turkmenistan has joined several key international environmental conventions, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p><p>Furthermore, our country is actively engaged in implementing the Central Asian Subregional Programme of Action to Combat Desertification.</p><p>Turkmenistan is pursuing a robust environmental policy under the leadership of the National Leader of the Turkmen people, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, and President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov. This policy is aimed at ensuring environmental safety, sustainable development, and the preservation of the country's natural heritage.</p><p>The pillars of this policy include upholding constitutional rights, developing a national environmental security system, and enforcing liability for environmental damage - as enshrined in Turkmenistan's Law on Environmental Safety.</p><p>To mitigate climate risks and strengthen the resilience of key economic sectors, the President resolved to adopt Turkmenistan's National Climate Change Strategy. In 2022, Turkmenistan approved its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, outlining commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p><p>As part of its environmental policy, Turkmenistan has planted over 162 million seedlings of diverse tree species nationwide over the past two decades. These afforestation initiatives are supported by international partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p><p>Turkmenistan is actively expanding its specially protected natural areas, which currently include nine nature reserves and 16 wildlife sanctuaries. These protected zones are vital for conserving the country's unique nature. However, Turkmenistan faces growing threats from water scarcity, driven by climate change, rising agricultural demand, and upstream economic activities in neighbouring countries.</p><p>Our water supply mostly relies on transboundary rivers - the Amu Darya, Murghab, Tejen, and Atrek - with annual demand reaching 25 cubic kilometres, most of which originates abroad. To address this, Turkmenistan is prioritising water-saving technologies and strengthened legal frameworks for sustainable water management. Under a Presidential resolution, agricultural producers now receive 10-year preferential loans at 1-percent interest to purchase farm machinery and water-saving equipment.</p><p>Proactive measures are being taken to protect rare and endangered species. Turkmenistan collaborates closely with international conservation organisations, achieving notable successes - such as a leopard population recovery project, which has expanded their habitat beyond Turkmenistan into Kazakhstan's neighbouring Mangystau Region.</p><p>The country also holds significant renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind power. A hybrid solar-wind power plant has been built in western Turkmenistan to supply clean energy to communities along Lake Altyn Asyr.</p><p>A cornerstone of this initiative is the development of a solar energy roadmap, incorporating innovative urban solutions like Arkadag - Turkmenistan's first smart green city. The project envisions feasibility studies and a pilot urban solar plant, projected to generate over 4 GW annually thereby reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by over 3,000 tonnes.</p><p>Four distinctive desert ecosystems - Bereketli Garagum, Gapla\\xF2gyr, Repetek, and Yeraji - are now included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Encouragingly, private sector representatives are playing an increasingly active role in addressing environmental challenges. Across Turkmenistan's agriculture and industry, cutting-edge waste-free technologies are being introduced, dramatically reducing environmental impacts while boosting resource efficiency.</p><p>Colleagues, friends,</p><p>This year marks a historic milestone for Turkmenistan - the 30th anniversary of our Permanent Neutrality status. At the same time, we remain fully committed to active international cooperation in developing sustainable solutions.</p><p>Turkmenistan stands ready to champion joint initiatives focused on nature conservation, climate adaptation, and sustainable development. In closing, I wish all participants productive discussions.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>(The Russian Government)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

South Africa's theme points the way - solidarity, equality and sustainability. Reaching all three goals requires justice. Justice for the developing world - and justice in particular for Africa and the Africans.</p><p>So many of the global challenges we face are deeply rooted in the injustice that the African continent historically suffered. Being from Portugal, the last colonial country in Africa, I know exactly what I am talking about.</p><p>And indeed the challenges are here in front of us.</p><p>From poverty, hunger and inequalities...</p><p>To deepening conflicts and the climate crisis...</p><p>And at the same time, we recognize that the global governance institutions that reflect the world of 1945 and do not adequately serve or represent developing countries - in particular African countries.</p><p>Our inability to tackle these challenges and more is eroding people's faith in Governments and institutions. And so the message is clear: Our institutions need an update.</p><p>In November, leaders committed, in the Summit of the Future, to reforming the tools of global governance - from global financial institutions to the United Nations itself, in particular the UN Security Council, which lacks legitimacy and effectiveness.</p><p>This agenda of reform was clearly reflected in the Pact for the Future, which was adopted at the UN Summit of the Future.</p><p>And you are critical to bringing that Pact to life and helping to lead this process of reform and renewal.</p><p>How can we do that?</p><p>First - the G20 must lead on delivering financial justice.</p><p>As you know well, financing is fundamental.</p><p>From inclusive economic growth, to supporting industrialization and food security, or addressing inequalities.</p><p>The Pact for the Future includes commitments that provide a road map to reform global financial institutions.</p><p>These institutions must represent today's economy - not the world of decades past. And developing countries must be represented fairly in their governance.</p><p>These institutions must also protect economies - particularly vulnerable ones - from global shocks.</p><p>It is time to mend and strengthen the global safety net that during the Covid we detected that it was no longer fit for purpose.</p><p>And we need to mobilize finance at scale to close the Sustainable Development Goals financing gap.</p><p>This means substantially increasing the capital and lending capacity of multilateral development banks, making them bigger and bolder.</p><p>And allow me a personal note. We are all aware that there is not enough money to address all the challenges that we face. Development challenges, climate challenges, many other dramatic problems that our world is full of.</p><p>And when we do not have enough money, the capacity to multiply the money that exits becomes vital. And that is where I truly believe that an enhanced role of multilateral development banks is absolutely crucial.</p><p>When your country puts $1 in a project of support in some place of the world, $1 is $1. If the same country puts $1 in the capital of the multilateral development bank, that $1 is 5, 7, depending now on how the bank has access to financial markets.</p><p>And indeed I am a true believer that we need to make a strong bet in making bigger and bolder, our multilateral development banks, and that the capitalization of the banks is one of the key instruments.</p><p>And if I remember well [from] my times as the Prime Minister, when you put some capital in an international financial institution, you do not need to put it in the deficit of your budgets, so there is another advantage for using this kind of mechanisms to multiply the resources that we have and we recognize are not enough for all the challenges that we face.</p><p>At the same time, it's very important to boost concessional funding, but to take into account that not only gross domestic product (GDP) must be the metrics, it's very important to look especially also at vulnerability, and we have just approved at the General Assembly a comprehensive vulnerability index.</p><p>At the same time, we need action to make the debt resolution architecture work in a more timely and effective manner. We need meaningful solutions to address the debt crisis, so countries can invest in meeting the basic needs of their people and drive long-term development.</p><p>The Pact for the Future includes a proposal for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lead a review of ways to strengthen and improve the sovereign debt architecture in collaboration with key partners.</p><p>I recognize all the efforts the G20 has made in relation to the so-called framework. But let's be clear, we are far from having an instrument able to address the debt problem that exits at global level.</p><p>A number of examples are positive, but examples do not represent the total reality that we face.</p><p>And July's conference on Financing for Development in Spain is a critical opportunity to make progress in all these key areas. And I urge finance ministries and central banks to fully engage in the preparations for this conference, so leaders can arrive prepared to advance high-impact solutions on financing for development.</p><p>One of the problems that we still have in international institutions, and I was Prime Minister and I know how difficult it is to coordinate the Government when you have different ministries with different views.</p><p>The truth is that in many of these institutions, countries are represented by different ministries and so the capacity to have ministers of finance fully engaged in the preparation of these international conferences, to make sure that what makes things move is part of the agenda, is absolutely essential.</p><p>Second - we need the G20 to lead on delivering climate justice.</p><p>Many vulnerable countries are being forced to respond to a crisis they did nothing to create. Meanwhile, they lack the necessary financial support to seize the benefits of clean energy to spur prosperity and eliminate poverty.</p><p>As the world's top emitters, G20 countries must lead the way in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. But recognizing that every G20 country have to do more in the reduction of emissions.</p><p>By next year, every Government must deliver new economy-wide national climate plans and align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C.</p><p>These new plans must cover all emissions and the whole economy, accelerate a just fossil fuel phase out, and contribute to the energy transition goals agreed at the twenty-eighth UN Climate Change Conference.</p><p>At the same time, we need developed countries supporting developing ones with adequate, affordable, and accessible finance and technology.</p><p>Through meaningful contributions to the new loss and damage fund...</p><p>By doubling adaptation finance by next year, as promised...</p><p>And by forging new partnerships - like the Just Energy Transition Partnership - that South Africa is a pioneer - to pave the way to a renewable future for all countries, swiftly and fairly.</p><p>And we must also ensure that Africa's critical mineral resources - that can power the renewables revolution worldwide - benefit Africans first and most.</p><p>We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past.</p><p>The UN Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals, co-chaired by South Africa and the European Union, identified a set of principles and recommendations to empower communities, create accountability, and ensure that clean energy drives equitable and resilient growth, with maximum added value in producing countries.</p><p>And third - we need the G20 to lead on technological justice. From digital technology to artificial intelligence (AI), the developing world needs to access and benefit from the technological revolution.</p><p>At September's Summit of the Future, world leaders endorsed the Global Digital Compact to spur progress across all these areas.</p><p>The Compact includes the first universal agreement on the international governance of artificial intelligence, ensuring that every country has a seat at the AI table. It calls for an independent international scientific panel on AI and initiating a global dialogue on its governance within the United Nations.

A growing sense of economic injustice and insecurity is contributing to the rise of authoritarian movements around the world. Meanwhile, the world is set to blast past global heating targets. But this is not inevitable. What if, instead, economic decisions were made with people and the planet at the center?</p><p>This is the idea behind the concept of a human rights economy, which means putting rights at the heart of economic policymaking. The concept draws from the work of human rights scholars and organizations around the world, while supporting transformative economic approaches emerging from other movements, including climate justice, gender justice, and decolonization.</p><p>International human rights law guides how global resources should be used for everyone's benefit while protecting the environment. It obligates governments to use the maximum of their available resources - individually and through international cooperation and assistance - to realize human rights. This includes economic, social, and cultural rights, such as to health, education, social security, housing, food, and water, as well as the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.</p><p>Yet governments have failed for decades to align their economies or international cooperation with these obligations. The exponential increase in resources has done too little to improve the lives of billions of people while devastating the planet. That needs to change.</p><p>Several human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, have collaborated on a working paper, available in English, French, and Arabic, which details how governments should set human rights as guideposts against which economic policies can be assessed, such as to progressively raise adequate revenues to fund universal public services and social security systems, as well as a just transition to sustainable energy.</p><p>At the same time, the paper recognizes that governments are often constrained by the global economic system within which they operate. Implementing human rights economies therefore means transforming the international financial architecture, including related to tax, debt, and the governance and operations of international financial institutions, to align with human rights. It also means moving beyond the longstanding fixation on GDP and growth as a measure of economic progress to metrics that reflect people's lived reality and the environment.</p><p>Our current economic approach is putting people and the planet in crisis. Human rights offer a blueprint for a far better approach.</p><p>Source: Human Rights Watch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGB-DP73-RRPX-513W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 3, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;

Unfortunately the lack of progress towards these goals in Bonn is concerning.</p><p>Restrictions on civic space in Bonn have highlighted how essential it is to ensure that the rights of participants attending COP29 in Baku in November are protected and guaranteed, especially freedom of expression and peaceful protest. These rights are regularly abused in Azerbaijan, a repressive petrostate which detains its critics, including environmental human rights defenders.</p><p>The Host Country Agreement, which sets out arrangements between the COP summit organizers and the host authorities, must guarantee these rights. The document should also be made publicly available in time for attendees to assess any risks they could face. It is unacceptable that the Host Country Agreement for last year's COP28 in the United Arab Emirates has only just been made available to us and contains no reference to the protection of these rights.</p><p>Far too little progress has been made at Bonn to ensure that states will agree a new adequately scaled-up target at COP29 for finance from high-income polluting countries to lower-income states on the frontline of the climate crisis. G7 countries, and others, including high-income fossil fuel producing states, must act to help protect the rights of people in lower income countries who are bearing the brunt of climate change but are least responsible for causing it. It is time for historical polluters to pay the climate debt they owe.</p><p>Background</p><p>The Bonn Climate Change Conference which ended today and COP29, which will be held from 11 to 22 November 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan, are held under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Amnesty International supports calls for a fast, fair, funded and forever phase out of fossil fuels and a human-rights compliant transition to renewable energy, and campaigns for the protection of free expression and peaceful protest in relation to climate action.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C83-CYD1-JB5P-J003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"381\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 17, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

But, as we approach the possibility of seismic shifts in British voting patterns, it is crucial to caution: a party's green sheen should not allow us to drop our guard, particularly when figures like Zack Polanski, a recent arrival to prominence within the Greens, arise as potential leaders.</p><p>Polanski, whose history includes support for centrist and pro-Zionist causes, and who was once quick to participate in the campaign to delegitimise Corbyn, poses difficult questions for those hoping for truly progressive leadership.</p><p>Political homelessness</p><p>Starmer's leadership of the Labour Party has been marked not by the bold action he once promised but by an aggressive shift to the right and the purging of the party's socialist spirit.</p><p>The party's abandonment of policies to end austerity, nationalise rail and utilities, and support the vulnerable has left millions feeling betrayed.</p><p>On welfare, pensions, and disability rights, Starmer has doggedly refused to reverse Tory-era attacks, and in too many cases, has doubled down on rhetoric targeting welfare dependency or promising to be 'tougher than the Tories.'</p><p>Veteran movie director Ken Loach, a lifelong supporter of human rights, who highlights the struggles of the underdog, oppressed and downtrodden, and a lifelong supporter of Labour's socialist tradition, was ejected from the party following its purge of left-wing members. He warned ominously of Starmer's trajectory.</p><p>'He wants to prove to the establishment and the right-wing press that he is a safe pair of hands for big business, the city, the banks, the military... The Labour Party now is part of the establishment.'</p><p>Zara Sultana, a Labour Party MP until her suspension in July 2024 as one of seven Labour MPs who voted to scrap the two-child benefit cap.

Instead, we're seeing the leadership triangulate towards the Tories.'</p><p>For activists who poured heart and soul into the Corbyn project, it is a bitter pill. The sense of betrayal is profound, as expressed by the Guardian's Owen Jones.</p><p>'Keir Starmer won by promising to stick to Corbyn's basic policy framework. One by one, he broke those pledges. That's not just political cynicism. It's fraud.'</p><p>Green temptation</p><p>Into this void walks the Green Party, whose anti-austerity policies and commitment to environmental justice sound, at least on paper, like the logical new home for left-wing voters.</p><p>Yet as we have all learned, parties are not immune to co-option, and history is replete with examples of successful left movements hollowed out by opportunists.</p><p>The rise of Polanski to a position of national influence in the Green Party demands the scrutiny of any voter who genuinely cares about radical change.</p><p>In his previous incarnations, Polanski was a member of the Liberal Democrats, a party whose coalition with the Conservatives post-2010 ushered in some of the most savage austerity policies in modern British history. More alarming to many, however, is his record during the Corbyn years.</p><p>Polanski was among the chorus of voices claiming that Labour under Corbyn was 'rife' with antisemitism, echoing attacks which, while rooted in legitimate concerns, were ruthlessly weaponised by establishment opponents to discredit the broader socialist platform.</p><p>With Starmer now presiding over a Labour Party that has accepted essentially the same neoliberal consensus as the Conservatives, the risk is clear: that the Greens, under a leadership eager to demonstrate its 'respectability' to the mainstream press, could follow the same tragic script.</p><p>Leopard, spots, and change</p><p>Polanski's recent statements, expressing regret over how the antisemitism crisis was handled, and criticism of Israel's behaviour in Gaza, appear to signal a shift. But to many, the question remains: are these the contrite reconsiderations of a changed man, or just the calculated rebranding of a political chameleon?</p><p>Across social media and activist circles, critics argue that Polanski's track record does not inspire confidence. You can't take a wrecking ball to the left in Labour, then rock up to lead the Greens and ask for trust. Leopards don't change their spots this quickly.</p><p>The Green Party has prided itself on being a bottom-up, member-driven movement. Yet the rise of politically ambitious figures with no deep roots in Green activism, parachuting in after abandoning other parties in their hour of need, rightly provokes suspicion.</p><p>As Jones wrote regarding Starmer's betrayal.</p><p>'Voters are not fools. If you say one thing and do another, they will clock it sooner or later. Credibility, when squandered, is almost impossible to regain.'</p><p>The same principle applies now to the Greens.</p><p>Deja Vu</p><p>If Labour under Starmer is proof of anything, it's that parties can and do abandon their principles overnight if the leadership believes it is expedient. Starmer's relentless targeting of rank-and-file left-wingers, his refusal to support even modest policies like social rent caps, and his attempts to reposition Labour as a party of business at the expense of public ownership have already left a devastating social legacy.</p><p>The poor, the disabled, the unemployed, and pensioners are all more vulnerable today because Labour will not defend them. Who is to say the Green Party, under the stewardship of a former Liberal Democrat whose left credentials are unproven, would not do the same?</p><p>Loach summarised the risk with characteristic clarity.</p><p>'The crisis is not just about one leader or another, it's about the direction of British politics. The establishment will always fight to maintain its power. A movement for real change must be ready to defend itself from within and without.'</p><p>Zara Sultana agrees.</p><p>'We can never take it for granted that parties will stick with progressive values. It's up to us to hold our leaders and would-be leaders to account.'</p><p>Recycled rhetoric</p><p>If the Green Party wishes to inherit the hopes of the millions betrayed by Labour, it must show far more than a fresh face or recycled rhetoric.</p><p>It must demonstrate a firm break with the revolving door of opportunists and careerists who move from party to party with barely a second thought for members' ideals.</p><p>The party's record under Caroline Lucas and its long history of supporting peace, social justice, and the environment are admirable. But new contenders must be scrutinised not just for what they say, but for what they have done, and who they have stood with when it mattered.</p><p>The alternative? Another round of betrayal, another generation of disenfranchised voters, and more broken promises.</p><p>For voters seeking genuine change, a government committed to ending inequality, tackling the climate crisis, defending human rights, and building public services, the lesson of recent years must be clear.</p><p>Tread carefully. Scrutinise not just the words, but the records of those who seek our trust.</p><p>The Green Party remains a potential force for good, but only if it remains true to its grassroots, not to those who saw their previous parties as disposable stepping stones.</p><p>To paraphrase an old saying: if you want change, beware the chameleons who appear at the colour of the moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHUKET-THAI2705202500010015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHUKET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX7-V9R3-RS91-S4TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461134</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1347\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Thaiger All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Thaiger</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 27, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

And so, with your permission I would like to address the distinguished members by simply saying dear colleagues. Dumelang. [Good day.]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wish to begin by expressing my deepest gratitude to His Majesty King Letsie III, and to the people of Lesotho for your warm welcome. I am honoured to be in the Kingdom of Lesotho more than 20 years after the visit of my dear friend and predecessor Kofi Annan. And I am honoured to address this Parliament as you celebrate the bicentenary of the Basotho nation.</p><p>Two centuries ago, as profound upheaval was reshaping southern Africa, King Moshoeshoe charted a revolutionary path. While others chose conflict, he embraced dialogue. When faced with hostility, he responded with wisdom and courage His vision transcended the challenges of his time - transforming this great land into a sanctuary of peace through diplomatic and moral courage.</p><p>By welcoming displaced communities and building bridges across divides, he showed the world how diversity can strengthen the fabric of nationhood. The principles he embodied - human dignity, diplomacy and the courage to embrace differences - lie at the heart of our shared aspirations at the United Nations.</p><p>Lesotho's partnership with the United Nations began even before your independence. In 1963, the General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution that warned against any attempt to annex or encroach upon the territorial integrity of Basutoland. That principled stand of the international community reaffirmed your inalienable right to self-determination and independence. And three years later, Lesotho joined the UN as a sovereign State.</p><p>Since then, you have been an unwavering voice for peace - honouring King Moshoeshoe's legacy of dialogue and solidarity. Your consistent support for multilateral solutions shows that a nation's true strength lies in its principles.</p><p>For all these reasons, I am especially honoured to convey a message not only to the people of Lesotho, but to Africa and indeed the world. A message of solidarity and justice for this great continent. We all know Africa's enormous potential.</p><p>But, let's be clear: deep injustices are denying Africa's rightful place on the world stage. These injustices share a common root: a global system designed without African voices; maintained without African participation; and perpetuated despite African protests.</p><p>When a continent that is home to nearly a fifth of humanity, remains systematically excluded from global decision-making, we must call this what it is: A relic of colonialism that has no place in today's world. Start with the UN Security Council. Nearly 80 years after its creation, Africa still awaits even a single permanent seat.</p><p>This hurts Africa, but it also hurts the Council - its effectiveness, its legitimacy and its credibility. From Sudan to the Sahel, conflicts rage and communities suffer. These crises demand not just global attention, they demand African leadership. Yet, Africa has no permanent voice when the world decides on matters of war and peace... in Africa, through the Security Council. That is unacceptable - and it must change. But we must also act to correct the injustices across many other fronts.</p><p>First, financial justice. The current international financial system is outdated, dysfunctional and unfair - to Africa and beyond. It was built for the world of 1945, not the twenty-first century. The current system not only reflects historical injustices - it exacerbates them.</p><p>Today, so many countries across Africa must choose between servicing debt and realizing their people's rights and needs. Their legitimate development aspirations are subject to credit ratings that do not reflect the enormous potential of the African continent.</p><p>African nations pay up to eight times more for borrowing than developed countries. So, for every dollar that a country like Lesotho spends on education or infrastructure, disproportionate sums are drained away in interest payments - with 11 per cent of your budget going into debt servicing. It is time to change it.</p><p>And the Pact for the Future adopted by the General Assembly in September charts a new course. It calls for reforming and boosting the lending capacity of Multilateral Development Banks, it calls for an Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Stimulus Plan of $500 billion a year for developing countries, and it calls for comprehensive debt relief.</p><p>And until now, the framework created by the Group of 20 (G20) has been applied to four countries. There are so many more that need debt relief, and I would say deserve debt relief because they are not responsible for the conditions that led to the high levels of debt that they face.</p><p>Africa's perspective and leadership must guide these reforms, to help create a system that serves all countries, not just the privileged few. And Lesotho has an important voice in advocating for these changes - a voice rooted in its proud history of resilience and justice.</p><p>Second, climate justice. Climate change is destroying our planet - from the snow-capped peaks of the Maluti Mountains to the sinking islands of the Pacific. Rising temperatures, extreme weather and soil erosion are threatening agricultural productivity and food security. Families are grappling with food shortages, water scarcity and the loss of livelihoods.</p><p>The continent accounts for less than 4 per cent of global carbon emissions - but suffers from some of the most devastating climate impacts. The environmental damage and lost productivity cost African economies billions each year - yet you receive only a fraction of global climate finance. In short: you are paying twice for a crisis that you did not cause. This is profoundly unfair.</p><p>Africa must not be forced to choose between economic development and climate action. The continent's vast renewable energy potential, from solar to wind to hydropower - and Lesotho is a fantastic example of that potential - remains largely untapped, while 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity.</p><p>A just transition means investing in renewable technologies, providing concessional finance for green investments and supporting the transfer of knowledge and technologies. And no other country would use better these instruments than Lesotho. You have demonstrated it in the past, I am sure you will do it in the future.</p><p>We need solidarity and justice in action, not just words. The Loss and Damage Fund must be operationalized swiftly and funded generously by those most responsible for climate destruction. And allow me to tell you a true story. The Loss and Damage Funds was a strong, strong demand of developing countries. So much loss and damage are taking place in the world. And it is fair that those who have responsibility about that loss and damage contribute to the response that is needed to avoid loss and to correct the causes of damage.</p><p>Now, when the Loss and Damage Fund was created there was a number of countries that have pledged support to the Loss and Damage Fund. And we could imagine when one sees the dimension of the loss of damage in the world that it would be a massive amount of money. Now the truth is, the amount pledged when the Loss and Damage Fund was created is exactly corresponding to the sum of the 10 annual salaries of the 10 most well-paid football players in the world. And we can see that we are far from having a serious commitment to the Loss and Damage Fund, and this must be quickly corrected.</p><p>Developed countries must meet their commitments to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year by next year and deliver the promised $300 billion annually for climate finance that were approved now in the last Conference of the Parties.</p><p>Landlocked and least developed countries like yours are especially vulnerable. And they require special support and easier access to finance and technology. We cannot treat the same way a least developed land-locked country as we treat a middle-income country, even if the middle-income country still has a number of difficulties.</p><p>And we must also enhance regional cooperation for climate-resilient development. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project is a perfect example - and I look forward to visiting the Katse Dam tomorrow.</p><p>Justice for Africa also means justice and opportunities for all Africans. By respecting, protecting and promoting human rights; by harnessing the energy, innovation and aspirations of the world's youngest population. including in Lesotho, you have an enormous potential and you are young people, but this economic global system must create the conditions for job to be available for that group of young people that is the future richness of your country.</p><p>Two thirds of your population is under the age of 30; that it is an enormous potential, but it needs to be properly invested, and for that, international support is necessary.</p><p>On the other hand, by confronting health challenges with renewed determination - particularly HIV/AIDS, which continues to affect too many families in Lesotho and across the continent; by pursuing disability inclusion; and by advancing gender equality.</p><p>No society can thrive while half its population is held back. Eliminating gender-based violence and child marriages, closing the education gap and offering equal opportunities are not just moral imperatives - they are essential for sustainable development in all countries in the continent and in the world.</p><p>Gender equality is fundamentally a question of power - and a means of redefining and transforming power that will yield benefits for all. We need bold, systemic change, including through affirmative measures such as quotas, to ensure women have a voice and can meaningfully participate in decision-making. And the United Nations is your partner in the journey toward sustainable and inclusive development.</p><p>Your role transcends these chambers. You represent the hopes and aspirations of all Basotho people. Through your legislative power, you can shape a prosperous and equitable future; invest in clean energy and climate resilience; advance economic transformation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; champion good governance, transparency and accountability; and leave no one behind - including women and girls, young people and persons with disabilities.</p><p>Your parliamentary diplomacy serves as a bridge, connecting Lesotho's aspirations with regional and global partnerships. Your history as a nation is one of courage and perseverance. Your rich natural resources, your location at the heart of Southern Africa and your commitment to sustainable development put you in a unique position. As you celebrate your bicentenary, you have the chance to build a new legacy for future generations. And in doing so, Lesotho is not alone.</p><p>Across the continent, nations are rising, drawing strength from their history, their culture, and their shared aspirations. Together, Africa is crafting a vision of transformation, built on the foundations of justice and solidarity.</p><p>This is your moment to show the world that from the challenges of today, a new era of hope and equality can be born. As you say in Sesotho: \"Mohale o tsoa maroleng\" - heroes emerge from the dust. May we find in this ancient wisdom the courage to face our shared future. And forge a heroic response worthy of the peoples' aspirations:Khotso, Pula, Nala. [Peace, Rain, Prosperity - the national motto]. Kea leboha.

Exacerbated by the impacts of climate change and associated adaptation costs, Enrico Gaveglia, UNDP Resident Representative in the Maldives, in an opinion editorial, outlined initiatives to assist the Maldives in navigating this high-stakes challenge. The article, published ahead of COP28, delves into the strategies employed by UNDP in the Maldives to address this complex issue and build resilience in state financing.</p><p>2) Climate Justice and Finance Advocacy at Sustainable Future Forum 2023, in Milan, Italy</p><p>Enrico Gaveglia, invited by Silvia Berzoni of Class CNBC and Milano Finanza, articulated the case for climate justice and climate finance at the Sustainable Future Forum 2023. Emphasizing the Maldives' quest for climate justice, the discussion included topics such as Loss and Damage and SDG Finance, aligning with the broader theme of advancing Sustainable Development Goals. This advocacy on the road to COP28 showcased the commitment to addressing the unique challenges faced by SIDS.</p><p>3) Report on Loss and Damage and Climate Litigation, a SIDS Perspective, with Frankfurt School</p><p>Coinciding with the landmark agreement at COP28 to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, UNDP Maldives released a new report advocating for enhanced funding for SIDS towards climate justice. The report presented a compelling case for utilizing both traditional and novel financing mechanisms to address the climate challenges faced by SIDS, emphasizing the need for equitable support in the face of climate-related risks.</p><p>4) Nature Conservation and Blue Economy Development in Maldives</p><p>UNDP recognized significant opportunities in Maldives for nature conservation and blue economy development. Enrico Gaveglia discussed the importance of striking the right balance between development and protection of Maldives' natural assets in an interview with Radhika Bajaj of China Global Television Network (CGTN). This perspective aligned with the Maldives' commitment to SDGs and conservation efforts.</p><p>5) Community Participation for Climate Action in Fuvahmulah</p><p>UNDP Accelerator Labs in Maldives organized collective intelligence sessions in Fuvahmulah Island, engaging citizens to generate data for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. This community-driven initiative underscored the importance of local participation in climate action and resilience-building.</p><p>6) 'Credit Ratings and Climate Chaos' - Advocating for Reform</p><p>Overseas Development Institute (ODI)'s Emily Wilkinson and UNDP's Kanni Wignaraja argued for the reform of credit agencies' approaches in the face of climate chaos, in a joint opinion editorial featured in Project Syndicate.

Our Vedic literature is goldmine for nurturing Mother Earth and propagating harmony between man and nature.</p><p>India's DNA carries the only vaccine against ecological collapse conspicuous consumption. We only have to read what is there in our goldmine, he added.</p><p>Addressing the valedictory session of National Conference on Environment- 2025 at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today, Shri Dhankhar stated, Developed nations must transcend the political boundaries in environmental thinking. Adopting models where planetary health becomes foundational to human prosperity and well-being.</p><p>/center&gt;</p><p>Recalling the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984, Shri Dhankar said, The Bhopal gas tragedy lesson is still unlearned. The Union Carbide Leakage of 1984. It was mega environmental negligence. Even after four decades, families suffered generation after generation, genetic disorders and groundwater contamination.....Just imagine how pathetic was the lack of awareness. We did not have an institution like NGT. We did not have a regulatory regime that could address the issue. Things would have been very different if there had been a regulatory regime of the current level then.</p><p>Emphasising on the need to evolve environmental ethics, he stated, ....There is a global need to evolve and believe in environmental ethics, this underscores human's moral obligations to protect and preserve the environment.......we have to be aware the planet is not exclusive to us. We are not its owners. Flora and fauna must flourish and blossom alongside and so must all other living beings. In such a scenario, man will have to learn to live in harmony with nature and other living beings. Are we doing it? No.....There will have to be individual focus on optimal utilisation of resources of the nature. This has to be our habit. Our fiscal power, our fiscal capacity cannot determine the use of natural resources. The consumption has to be optimal.</p><p>Both Ecological Extension and Conservation Ethics advocate harmonious human-nature relationship, and so easy to bring about. It doesn't call for anything but a positive mindset towards life. We have to focus on environmental preservation and prudent resource stewardship for generational sustainability, he added.</p><p>Highlighting the interconnectedness of NGT with law, science and ethics, Shri Dhankhar stated, The way I look to NGT, N for nurturing, G for green and T for tomorrow. NGT for me is nurturing green for tomorrow. This is not just word play. It is vision of an institution that connects law, science and ethics to transform our relationship with nature. Let us grow from our very roots, wield cutting edge, tools and uphold climate justice with unwavering resolve.</p><p>Let peace prevail in the sky and space. Let peace reign and radiate in earth, in water and in all plants. Let peace prevail everywhere,he added.</p><p>Dr. (Smt.)

Environmental protection and promotion will be possible only through continuous activism based on awareness and everyone's participation.</p><p>The President said that our children and the younger generation have to face and contribute to environmental transition on a much wider scale. She highlighted that elders in every family worry about which school or college their children will study in, and what career they will choose. This worry is justified. But, we all also have to think about what kind of air our children will breathe, what kind of water they will get to drink, whether they will be able to hear the sweet sounds of birds or not, whether they will be able to experience the beauty of lush green forests or not. She said that these topics have economic, social, and scientific aspects, but the most important thing is that the challenges related to all these topics also have a moral aspect. It is our moral responsibility to provide a legacy of a clean environment to the coming generations. For this, we will have to adopt an environmentally conscious and sensitive lifestyle so that the environment is not only protected but also enhanced and the environment can become more vibrant. Balancing clean environment and modern development is both an opportunity and a challenge.</p><p>The President said that we believed that nature, like a mother, nourishes us, and we should respect and protect nature. The basis of the Indian heritage of development is nourishment, not exploitation; protection, not elimination. Following this tradition, we want to move forward toward a developed India. She was happy to note that over the last decade, India has achieved several examples of early completion of its Nationally Determined Contributions as per international agreements.</p><p>The President said that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has played an important role in the environmental governance of our country. It has played a decisive role in the field of environmental justice or climate justice. The historic decisions given by NGT have a wide impact on our lives, our health, and the future of our earth. She urged the institutions associated with the environment management eco-system and citizens to continuously strive for environmental protection and promotion.</p><p>The President said that our country and the entire world community have to follow a path that is environment friendly. Only then will humanity make real progress. She stated that India has presented many exemplary examples to the world community through its green initiatives. She expressed confidence that with the participation of all stakeholders, India will play the role of green leadership at the global level. She said that we all have to make India a developed nation by the year 2047 where the air, water, greenery, and prosperity attract the entire world community.</p><p>The National Conference on 'Environment - 2025', being organised by NGT, aims to bring together key stakeholders to discuss pressing environmental challenges, share best practices, and collaborate on future action plans for sustainable environmental management.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FFX-9KW3-RTJG-R0PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 1, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

No matter your background, where you come from, who you are, your gender, everything, we all have the right to that opportunity.</p><p>Ocevne warming up the room at the Stand Up for Social Justice concert in Geneva.</p><p>'No climate justice without social justice'</p><p>Climate justice was another recurring theme throughout the event, an issue highlighted by Mr. Terena, a doctoral student in social anthropology at the University of S\\xE3o Paulo and poet who spends much of his time defending the rights of his community and others.</p><p>There is no climate justice without social justice, he told the audience. We know that standing forests are the simplest and most efficient solution for fighting global warming.</p><p>The young researcher slammed the impact of mining companies and agribusinesses on his ancestral land that belongs to the Terena people of Brazil in the Pantanal region of Mato Grosso do Sul.</p><p>This is not just a territorial issue, but a matter of physical and cultural survival for our peoples and for humanity as indigenous lands represent the most important areas of biodiversity, he said, inviting the audience to fight for a common, diverse living world.</p><p>'The future is going to be very hot'</p><p>Indeed, the future is going to be very hot, said Ms. Flow, adding that it is already very hot in Brazil, and this is urgent for us because without water, we cannot live, and without food, [we cannot] either.</p><p>Advocating for issues affecting indigenous communities, including the burning impacts of climate change on the natural resources of her home country, she said collectively not enough is getting done.</p><p>We need more communication and more exchanges. By exchanges, I mean listening, speaking, listening, speaking and thinking about new ways of living well so that we can keep heading into the future.</p><p>Amplifying marginalised voices</p><p>The event is the brainchild of UNRISD communications chief Karima Cherif, who wanted to bridge art and research through the initiative.</p><p>She says her institute works with scholars from the global South to ensure that the voices and expertise of minorities are heard.</p><p>We're giving voices to the marginalised and the youth, explained Ms. Cherif, who sees art as a way to translate what we do in a language that can touch hearts.</p><p>'Never give up'</p><p>Thuy-San Dinh, who heads Antigel, echoed her vision and encouraged the young audience to pursue their goals, recalling when she co-created the annual event 15 years ago.</p><p>You have to believe in your ideas and never give up, Ms. Dinh said.</p><p>Melanie Rouquier, who created SHAP SHAP, a non-profit that fights global inequality and discrimination through cultural projects, told several activists in the room that each of their actions showed citizen engagement was not a lost cause.</p><p>To resist, we have to get together, she said.</p><p>Brisa Flow playing a traditional instrument at the Stand Up for Social Justice concert in Geneva in February 2025.</p><p>Connecting generations</p><p>For Aryan Yasin, a designer from Geneva who founded a cultural non-profit supporting disadvantaged youth, the show was an opportunity for cross-pollination and broadening his network by connecting with UN staff.</p><p>The exceptional venue is not a place where you would necessarily see young people, he said. But, that actually allows us to create an intergenerational connection, with people who are more experienced, more established, he added.</p><p>After the show, management student Ludivine said she was mesmerised by the experience. Putting on a concert with one of her favourite artists there to denounce inequalities makes sense... because at the UN, people get together to talk about inequalities around the world.</p><p>What is social justice?</p><p>After the event ended, doctoral students Beatrice and Thomas shared what the concept of social justice, which can seem quite abstract, meant to them.</p><p>It's about recognising and taking differences into account while ensuring that everyone has the same access to the same opportunities, said Beatrice, from Italy, who studies at \\xC9cole Polytechnique F\\xE9d\\xE9rale de Lausanne.</p><p>That may mean that some people will need more support, while others may not need as much, but have different needs.</p><p>Thomas offered a more societal vision of the idea.</p><p>For me, it's something that is both individual and collective - something that must be built as a society. It is entirely dependent on the structures we have put in place, but it also relies on everything that is local.</p><p>Read our social justice explainer here.</p><p>'We need to be united'</p><p>Ahead of the concert, Tatiana Valovaya, Director-General of the UN Office at Geneva set the tone in her opening remarks in the Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room.</p><p>This room sees a lot of very important and challenging negotiations, she told the audience. But, today we open this room to everyone.</p><p>Geneva Mayor Christina Kitsos, whose term is guided by the motto what connects us, reminded the youthful audience of the UN's fundamental role despite the worrying rise of desire to undermine all the work [that has been done] around humanitarian aid and human rights.</p><p>We need to be united, strong and truly hopeful and courageous to ensure that we stay the course, that we remain a beacon in this world in turmoil, she said.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5V-53W3-S7FH-M4K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 24, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;

This year, we celebrate the monumental strides we have made since the Beijing Conference in 1995. This is also the year we celebrate 25 years since the adoption of the UN Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security.</p><p>All this amidst a crisis of trust in the multilateral system, yet these platforms are a testament to what multilateralism can deliver for billions of people, especially women and girls.</p><p>And we have much to be proud of. This week, we have heard encouraging stories of progress. There are more girls in school than at any point in history. More women are breaking barriers, rising to power and reshaping the world of work. We have stronger laws on gender-based violence. Thanks to the determination and perseverance of women and feminist movements across the globe.</p><p>But let us not forget: This year is also a call to action. Millions of women and girls still face unimaginable challenges. Armed conflicts threaten their safety. Gender inequality persists in our political systems. And the scourge of violence continues to claim women's lives every day, too often in their own homes and in the hands of those closest to them.</p><p>With just five years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this must be our turning point to succeed in our aspirations for gender equality. Achieving gender equality is not only an issue of justice. It holds the key to unlocking progress on the SDGs and lasting peace.</p><p>The United Nations remains is committed to taking bold actions. Working with Member States and partners to build a future where gender equality is not just a goal, but a lived reality for the millions being left behind.</p><p>Through our Gender Equality Acceleration Plan and the Clarion Call, which were announced by the Secretary-General last week.</p><p>We will transform the way we work, putting gender equality at the centre of all our efforts. And we will strengthen support to all Member States in their efforts to advance the rights, equality, and empowerment of all women and girls.</p><p>Guided by the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the six priority actions of the Beijing+30 Action Agenda offer a road map: To put gender equality at the centre of our global efforts. From poverty eradication to peace. From digital transformation to climate justice.</p><p>The Pact for the Future commits to integrate women into all aspects of sustainable development and building and sustaining peace.</p><p>These commitments must be honoured.</p><p>Let us seize this opportunity. Let us ensure our commitments translate into lasting impact. And let us work together in solidarity to build a future where gender equality is not an aspiration, but a reality for all women and girls.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FF9-0BM3-RRVV-541Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 31, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D7R3</classCode><className>GENDER EQUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIEG</classCode><className>GENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DREL</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D89F</classCode><className>FEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DNAL</classCode><className>GENDER BASED VIOLENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00098X6</classCode><className>SEX &amp; GENDER ISSUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000CA2H</classCode><className>POVERTY &amp; HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DSCA</classCode><className>POVERTY REDUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DREL</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DRQ4</classCode><className>DIGITALIZATION &amp; DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Therefore, he is asking that the company pay for about 0.5% of the cost of protecting Huaraz, some 17,000 ($18,400).</p><p>\"What I am asking is for the company to take responsibility for part of the construction costs, such as a dike in this case,\" the father of two said in Lima, adding that \"the melting of the glaciers is very evident.\"</p><p>For its part, RWE has said it doesn't know why it was being singled out, having never operated in Peru and saying it has plans to be carbon neutral by 2040.</p><p>Case will 'set a huge precedent'</p><p>The judicial process has been an uphill battle for Lluiya, with the case first being dismissed by a court in the city of Essen in 2015, before the Hamm court agreed to hear an appeal two years later. Proceedings were further delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The hearing later in March will see the court deciding what evidence is admissable in the final trial, the first time a climate case against a major polluter has gotten this far in Germany.</p><p>Andrea Tang, a lawyer for the NGO Germanwatch, who is paying Lliuya's legal fees, said that the case \"would set a huge precedent for the future of climate justice... something that could be applied in other civil cases, in other countries as well.\"</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F97-NSM3-S1FJ-614F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001Y4E</classCode><className>RWE AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0005AOM</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE WELLE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS221310 WATER SUPPLY &amp;

But when turning to a few pages, your economic and finance reporter, Nuntawun Polkuamdee, reported that leading Swiss investment bank UBS has upgraded Thailand's equity market from overweight to neutral. Though, UBS's reading is on macro aspects not only of Thailand but also for the world and not micro.</p><p>From experiences in determining the rationales of each writer's opinion, one tends to gain more from dry analysis than dramatic citations of things like the Titanic tragedy.</p><p>Songdej Praditsmanont</p><p>Earth needs laws</p><p>Re: \"The cycle of self-interest\", (PostBag, March 16).</p><p>Khun Michael Setter, in his many PostBag contributions, usually tweaks the opinion of his opponents such that they fit a need to release his hilariously stubborn \"climate denial\" rage.</p><p>The UN promotes multilateralism but has never \"been seeking to end the sovereignty of nations\", as Khun Setter asserts. U Thant called it a myth, as an extremely courageous and visionary person.</p><p>But this \"Eastern\" view of reality has been blocked by the strategically upheld myth of heroic individual autonomy. This worldview is a cornerstone of the US-driven world economy and its hegemony, which Khun Michael calls \"modern civilisation\".</p><p>Do we think \"everyone will voluntarily give up their sovereignty to save the Earth?\" Do we promote \"communism\" or \"enforced altruism\"? Do our proposals undermine the \"foremost unalienable human right of self-governance\" and the \"ownership of oneself and one's property\"?</p><p>Appropriate law and governance innovations like Earth Trusteeship to support these social initiatives and ensure they become part of our mainstream -- and not be branded as \"idealistic nonsense\" -- is a task long overdue.</p><p>At the UN level, we speak about the law of the oceans (our global commons), biodiversity protection, and climate justice as challenges requiring contemporary approaches no longer dictated by the past and by our worrisome present.</p><p>Hans van Willenswaard</p><p>Debt truth hurts</p><p>Re: \"Risk of financial crisis creeps ever closer\", (Opinion, Feb 6)  and  \"Thailand on the brink of financial collapse\", (Opinion, Feb 20).</p><p>Freelance economist/columnist Chartchai Parasuk notes in his opinion pieces that corporate debt has now reached an unprecedented level of about 130% of GDP, while household debt is now so high that banks have refused to lend money to normal Thai people, causing Thais to resort to using informal financial institutions with ridiculously high interest rates for their loans.</p><p>This is why the above economist is absolutely sure that Thailand's economy will soon collapse, but he leaves it up to the reader to decide for him or herself.</p><p>There have been a couple of doubting Thomases who previously mocked him in this space for his dire economic pronouncements concerning the Thai economy. These smart-alecs can't accept the truth and have been unable to challenge Ajarn Chartchai by using facts, but rather with empty talk. I suggest that everyone carefully reads what the above columnist is stating here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG2103202500010046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCR-TY23-RRP7-32HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24135\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 21, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002LGM</classCode><className>UBS AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0006VLI</classCode><className>ICEBERG AS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>UBSW (JSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The president also started the one-year process to once again pull out of the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p>Earlier this month, the U.S. withdrew from a special climate agreement in which rich nations help small poor nations switch to cleaner energy.</p><p>When the fund was agreed upon in 2022, then-President Joe Biden pledged that the U.S., the world's biggest historic carbon dioxide emitter, would contribute $17.5 million.</p><p>\"It's a great shame to see the U.S. going back on its promises,\" said Mohamed Adow, founder of Power Shift Africa and a veteran of United Nations climate negotiations. \"This decision will result in great suffering for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. These people have contributed the least to the climate emergency they are now living through.\"</p><p>A dozen countries that have polluted less - Australia, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom - and the European Union have pledged more than the U.S. The two biggest pledges - $104 million - came from Italy and France. As of January, the Loss and Damage Fund had $741.42 million in pledges, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Poorer nations, often in the global south, had long framed the fund as one of environmental justice.

We have been working on human rights issues in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) for more than 30 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To ensure that human rights issues and concerns receive the attention they deserve in the presidential election campaign, we are submitting the following 16 questions to the Democratic Party of Korea, the New Reform Party, and People Power Party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The goal of the questionnaire is to give each of the campaigns the opportunity to provide South Korean voters with the views of their candidate on issues concerning the protection of human rights in South Korea, as well as the human rights of North Koreans.</p><p>We hope that you can complete this questionnaire in as much detail as possible to provide voters with your perspectives on these issues.</p><p>Please respond by May 20, 2025. After which, we will publish the responses received. Please address any questions and responses about this request (in either Korean or English) to Lina Yoon, Senior Korea Researcher, Human Rights Watch at [contact information redacted].</p><p>Thank you very much for your participation in this questionnaire. We look forward to hearing from you.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Lina Yoon</p><p>Senior Korea Researcher</p><p>Asia Division</p><p>Human Rights Watch Questions to</p><p>Republic of Korea Presidential Candidates</p><p>Ahead of June 2025 Election</p><p>Emergency Powers and Democratic Safeguards</p><p>1. Former President Yoon Suk-yeoldeclared martial law on December 3, 2024.</p><p>1. What is your position on the scope of presidential emergency powers under South Korean law?</p><p>2. What legal or constitutional reforms will your government make to the laws related to emergency powers to best protect human rights and democratic institutions?</p><p>Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom</p><p>2. South Korea's press-freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders slipped to 62nd in 2024 from 43rd in 2022.</p><p>1. What are the greatest threats to freedom of expression and media freedom in South Korea, and what steps will your government take to address them?</p><p>2. South Korea's National Security Law criminalizes positive comments about North Korea and the dissemination of North Korean propaganda. Defamation is a criminal offense focused on whether the statement was in the public interest. How do you assess the National Security Law and criminal defamation laws and their impact on freedom of expression and media freedom?</p><p>Rights of Women and Girls</p><p>3. Gender-based violence, including digital sex crimes, against women and girls is pervasive in South Korea. The abrupt rise of nonconsensual imagery and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled sexual abuse material, or deepfakes, have prompted mass protests; registered cases relating to sexually abusive deepfakes increased 227 percent in 2024. Impunity for digital sex crimes persists despite tougher penalties. Conviction rates remain low, victims often face mistreatment in the criminal legal system, and support services are inadequate.</p><p>What is your proposed policy to ensure women and girls can live free from all forms of violence and harassment, including digital sex crimes? Please detail planned measures to address gender-based violence.</p><p>4. In 2024, South Korea retained the widest gender wage gap in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) at 31 percent. The World Economic Forum found that in South Korean women hold fewer than 13 percent of board seats.</p><p>1. What is your position on the country's gender wage gap and leadership imbalance? What policies will your government implement to end discrimination against women and increase women's economic and leadership opportunities?</p><p>2. What is your position on the ratification of the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention No. 190 on Violence and Harassment?</p><p>5. The proposal to abolish the Ministry of Gender and Family was an important campaign issue in 2022.</p><p>1. What is your position on abolishing the ministry?</p><p>2. What policies will you adopt to ensure compliance with South Korea's international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), regardless of the Ministry of Gender and Family's institutional future?</p><p>Economic Insecurity</p><p>6. Household debt in the last quarter of 2024 stood at 91.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), second among 38 major economies. Youth unemployment as of March 2025 reached 7.5 percent. Recent studies show the top 10 chaebols (family-run conglomerates) account about 60 percent of South Korea's GDP.</p><p>1. What is your diagnosis of the key drivers of South Korea's rising economic insecurity and inequality?</p><p>2. What concrete measures, such as those related to wages, taxation, housing affordability, and social security, will your government take to reduce inequality and improve people's economic, social, and cultural rights?</p><p>Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination Law</p><p>7. South Korea does not have a single statute protecting people who often face discrimination, including women, older people, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transexual (LGBT) people, people with disabilities, and migrants such as North Korean escapees, refugees, and economic migrants. What is your position on enacting a nationwide anti-discrimination act?</p><p>LGBT Rights</p><p>8. Article 92-6 of the Military Criminal Act criminalizes same-sex sexual acts with a military person regardless of whether the acts are consensual or happened within or outside of military facilities. What is your position on article 92-6 of the Military Criminal Act?</p><p>9. The Supreme Court in 2024 ordered equal health-insurance coverage for same-sex partners. What's your position on same-sex partnerships for purposes such as health insurance, housing, and taxation?</p><p>Children's Rights</p><p>10. Discrimination in access to education affects children's right to education, including children who are refugees, migrants, from North Korea, LGBT, or have disabilities.</p><p>1. What actions will your government take to ensure all children in South Korea have access to inclusive, quality and free primary and secondary education?</p><p>2. What legal, budgetary, and administrative steps will your government take to ensure at least one year of free pre-primary education to fulfill the commitment made as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals?</p><p>11. Girls in South Korea are vulnerable to misinformation, gender-based violence, discrimination, and abuse, early and unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, harmful sexual behavior, and sexual exploitation. Since 2024, South Korean girls were overwhelmingly the target of sexually explicit AI deepfakes.</p><p>1. Should South Korea have comprehensive sexuality education in schools and what steps would you take to achieve this?</p><p>2. What steps will you take to ensure that schools are safe, inclusive environments?</p><p>3. How will your government regulate AI to ensure that technology protects all children's rights, and is not misused to exploit children?</p><p>Online Safety, Digital Literacy and Privacy</p><p>12. In December 2024, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the UN Convention against Cybercrime. The private sector, human rights organizations, and the UN human rights office expressed widespread concern that the treaty could be used to facilitate human rights violations. The convention will be open for signature at a signing ceremony planned for October 2025 in Vietnam.</p><p>1. What is your position regarding South Korea signing and ratifying the UN Convention against Cybercrime?</p><p>2. What measures will you support to safeguard human rights while countering cybercrime?</p><p>Rights of Older People</p><p>13. South Korea has the highest poverty rate among older people in the OECD.</p><p>1. What will you do to reduce poverty among older people?</p><p>2. What specific measures will you put in place to ensure social security programs are adequate to guarantee every older person an income of at least a living wage?</p><p>Climate Justice and Environmental Rights</p><p>14. Fossil fuels remain South Korea's main source of carbon emissions. In August 2024, the Constitutional Court ruled that South Korea, the world's nineth largest carbon emitter in 2023, was violating young people's rights with its mid-term emission targets.</p><p>1. What emissions-reduction pathway and accountability mechanisms will your government adopt to comply with the ruling? What is your position on South Korea's reliance on fossil fuels in its power mix?</p><p>2. What is your position regarding South Korea's responsibility for global deforestation, which is linked to the country's demand for wood pellets that power its biomass power plants?</p><p>Human Rights Policy toward North Korea</p><p>15. The South Korean National Assembly passed the North Korean Human Rights Act in March 2016, but the North Korean Human Rights Foundation has not been established. North Korean human rights issues remain deeply politicized in the country.</p><p>1. What is your overarching approach to advancing human rights in North Korea while engaging on security and humanitarian issues with the country?</p><p>2. How will you operationalize the North Korean Human Rights Act, including by establishing the foundation, and ensure a depoliticized, consistent policy toward North Korea?</p><p>Death Penalty</p><p>16. South Korea carried out its last execution in 1997, but retains the death penalty in various laws.</p><p>1. What is your position on the death penalty? Will your government repeal or amend laws that prescribe the death penalty for various criminal offenses?</p><p>2. Will your government ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty?</p><p>Source: Human Rights Watch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FTR-CBM3-RRHM-D2GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 19, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CT</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS &amp;

On the same stretch of waterway where it used to ferry coal, the hull is now laden with a variety of genres.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the moment there's just tonnes of really gorgeous books about nature, about gardening, about the planet and the oceans... Victoria says. It's so difficult not to have too many, to be honest, we could sink the boat with how many there are.</p><p>On the high street or waterway, bookshops are among the most comforting of public spaces. But like the books they hold, a good bookshop also expands our horizons - and better equips us for the challenges of the modern world. At a time of climate breakdown, they have a vital role to play.</p><p>From Leeds Dock to the cobbled streets of Dorset and Edinburgh, we spoke to booksellers about the joys and responsibilities of that job.</p><p>Matching the right book to the right person</p><p>At the simplest level, people need information. A lot of what you come to online is clickbait, or it's nonsense, or it's strongly opinionated TikToks with no groundwork in reality, says Victoria. I think people want to look after the planet, but they don't always know where to start.</p><p>'Nature writing' can be a narrow section in some bigger shops, but is given breathing room and space to mingle with other titles at independents. It is part of a rich ecosystem of environmental and climate books.</p><p>FOLDE - at the top of the iconic Gold Hill street in Shaftesbury, Dorset - focuses mainly on climate action, conservation, wildlife and land management, nature fiction and nature memoir, as well as books about the natural world for children.</p><p>One of the really important roles of booksellers [is] to understand what a person is looking for and to match them to the book that sets them on a journey, says co-founder Amber Harrison.</p><p>A fiery and fact-laden book would be an ill-suited guide to somebody searching for hope, for example. More fitting would be one that offers steps forward, from making personal changes to taking action within an organisation or lobbying at a higher level.</p><p>Alongside non-fiction, Victoria sees a special value in folklore and fairytales, that encourage people to make connections with the land - through stories that for many years have been used as a way to protect the Earth.</p><p>Jessica Gait\\xE1n Johannesson is the digital campaigns manager at Lighthouse, described as Edinburgh's radical bookshop. The way we see it, books are the starting points of action making and of change making, she says.</p><p>It's not enough with people reading climate fiction or books about environmental injustice. What do you do when you put the book down? As a hub for grassroots organising, the shop connects people to groups they can join and actions they can take after reading a book that fires them up.</p><p>Organising the world with language</p><p>For Jessica, a bookseller's role is to push against this idea that the climate crisis can in any way be separate from all our other crises that we are living through at the moment.</p><p>'Radical' comes from the word root, she notes. It entails going to the root of problems, rather than talking about superficial solutions.</p><p>Bookshop curation, reading lists, events and one-to-one conversations are ways of offering a deeper analysis and highlighting climate connections - seeing what resonates for individuals.</p><p>Conversations can take books out of the neat categories that publishers put them in for ease of reference. While curating requires an adaptive approach, she says. It's about people being able to find the right books that they're looking for. But also, maybe people being exposed to other kinds of books they might not otherwise have found.</p><p>Lighthouse has a nature and environment section where they make sure that underrepresented writers are easy to find, since nature writing by tradition has been very, very white and very middle class.</p><p>It's important to hold your values true, says Victoria. I think that's what people love about independent bookshops, every one of us is different.</p><p>Hold Fast only sells vegan cookbooks, and travel books that don't encourage flying. Visitors perusing its up-cycled shelves can also purchase oat milk chocolate.</p><p>FOLDE embodies its environmental values too. It runs on 100 per cent renewable energy, and is the first bricks and mortar bookshop in Europe to be certified as a B-corp, says Amber, who co-founded the shop after a 20-year career in sustainability in the IT and aviation industry.</p><p>But Lighthouse takes the remit of a climate-conscious bookshop a step further, by organising probing events and campaigning for a book trade free of fossil fuel investments.</p><p>From the shop to the digital sphere</p><p>Lighthouse is both the physical shop on West Nicholson Street, the digital space that the booksellers operate in, and an Edinburgh book fair they organise every year, says Jessica.</p><p>Online, they commission blogs from local climate justice organisers, and livestream events so they're accessible to all. The inaugural Climate Fiction Prize shortlist is covered in a blog that contextualises the prize with historical works and links out to current climate campaigns.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Radical Book Fair, which Jessica programmes, has a unique emphasis on activism. Each panel of authors also includes at least one local organiser, further embodying Lighthouse's 'read, think, act' mantra.</p><p>They also support the work of Fossil Free Books, a collective of book workers organising for an industry free of fossil fuel funding, many of whom are based in Scotland.</p><p>The publishing industry is taking steps to reduce its impact on the climate so there are initiatives like Publishing Declares where organisations and publishers and booksellers can sign up to the sector's first declaration on climate change, adds Victoria.</p><p>There are some publishers who are starting to really think about the carbon footprint of the books that they produce, and that's really good to see.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FMV-CC53-RRYF-J1S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Lighthouses</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTY5N0M5QkJFOEQyNEUyOEEwNzgzRTg5QjU5NUI2OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009U6V</classCode><className>BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UJC</classCode><className>LITERATURE GENRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UDR</classCode><className>NON FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

Instead of mainstreaming equal rights, we're seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny,\" UN Secretary Antonio Guterres said in a statement.</p><p>UN Women report finds mixed progress</p><p>Looking back at the last 30 years, the report found that while there has been progress, it is not nearly enough.</p><p>Although the rate of female representation in parliaments worldwide has nearly doubled, men still make up three-fourths of lawmakers.</p><p>The number of women with social protection, such as health care and protection from violence, increased by a third between 2010 and 2030, but still remains out of reach for 2 billion women and girls.</p><p>In terms of legal rights, 88% of countries have passed laws and built services to end violence against women. Most have banned discrimination against women and several are improving their quality of education and life. Yet, women still have only 64% of the legal rights of men, the report said.</p><p>Since 2022, cases of conflict-related sexual violence have risen by 50% with women and girls suffering 95% of these cases.</p><p>Domestic violence continues to be an alarming issue, the report found.</p><p>\"Globally, violence against women and girls persists at alarming rates. Across their lifetime, around one in three women are subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by a non-partner,\" it said.</p><p>Meanwhile, gender gaps at work remain stagnant and women do 2.5 times more unpaid care work than men.</p><p>What should be done?</p><p>The report outlined an agenda meant to improve women's rights. A six-point action plan touched on tasks including a digital revolution for women and girls, freedom from poverty, a zero violence policy and complete and equal decision-making power.</p><p>It also called for climate justice for women.</p><p>\"We must prioritize women's and girls' rights in climate adaptation, center their leadership and knowledge, and ensure they benefit from new green jobs,\" a statement accompanying the report said.</p><p>With a new roadmap based on the report's finding, UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said the agency hopes the world will be closer to the UN's goal of achieving gender equality by 2030.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F97-JXJ3-S3P3-12P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000D89F</classCode><className>FEMINISM &amp;

This has already led to the dubious criminal prosecution of several prominent activists and journalists. The arrest of renowned human rights defender Anar Mammadli is yet another egregious example of this disturbing trend.</p><p>His arrest follows a pattern of abuse of the criminal justice system to silence government critics, which include illegal searches, denying access to lawyers, torture and ill-treatment in detention, and arbitrary detentions rubber-stamped by compliant courts. We call for an end to this sustained effort to silence dissent and for Anar Mammadli to be released immediately.</p><p>Background</p><p>On 29 April 2024, Anar Mammadli was on the way to pick up his child from nursery when he was apprehended by unidentified masked men and driven away in a black vehicle. According to family members, police then searched Anar Mammadli's house and allegedly planted money. The Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed his detention and his sister reported that he is officially suspected of smuggling by prior conspiracy by a group of persons under Article 206.3.2 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan, and arrested in connection with the case of Abzas Media. He was reportedly denied access to his lawyer overnight when kept in a temporary detention centre in Baku.</p><p>In 2014 Anar Mammadli was recognized as a Prisoner of Conscience by Amnesty International when he was dealt a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence on trumped up charges of tax evasion, illegal entrepreneurship, and abuse of office. He was pardoned in 2016 but has since faced repeated attacks from the authorities and the pro-government media, intensifying in the lead-up to COP29.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXX-3J71-DXMS-826M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 3, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Tax Avoidance &amp;

Trump signed a memorandum requiring radical transparency regarding wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars by the federal government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It requires all departments and agencies to disclose details about terminated programs, cancelled contracts, and discontinued grants to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p><p>PUTTING AN END TO WASTEFUL SPENDING: By signing this memorandum, President Trump recognizes that the American people have a right to see how the federal government has wasted their hard-earned wages.</p><p>The United States government has wasted taxpayer dollars on programs, contracts, and grants that do not serve the American public's interests.</p><p>For too long, taxpayers have subsidized ideological projects overseas and domestic organizations engaged in actions that undermine the national interest.</p><p>The Biden Administration spent billions on electric vehicle charging stations, yet only a fraction were completed.</p><p>The Trump Administration recently canceled a Biden-era $50 million environmental justice grant to an organization that believes climate justice travels through a Free Palestine.</p><p>Numerous USAID grants have come under review, including $1.5 million to advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities.</p><p>The Biden Administration gave nearly $4.6 million to help foreign groups promote LGBT projects like drag shows and pride parades.</p><p>The Trump Administration found $20 billion parked at a financial institution by the Biden Administration to fund partisan pet projects.</p><p>President Trump's Department of Education canceled $881 million in unnecessary contracts that were not benefiting students, including a $4.6 million contract just to coordinate Zoom and in-person meetings.</p><p>President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already recovered $1.9 billion in taxpayer funds misplaced by the Biden Administration.</p><p>The Government Accountability Office released a report last year estimating that the federal government could lose between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.</p><p>KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump campaigned on a promise to return power back to the American people by cleaning out the Deep State, firing rogue bureaucrats and career politicians, and targeting government corruption.</p><p>President Trump recently signed a memorandum to stop last-minute collective bargaining agreements issued by the Biden Administration designed to constrain the incoming Trump Administration from reforming government.</p><p>President Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to bring accountability and transparency to federal spending, ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively.</p><p>President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring every new rule is justified by clear benefits for taxpayers.</p><p>The Trump Administration is aggressively investigating Biden-era programs that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on inefficient and politically-driven projects, including canceling unnecessary government contracts and grants that do not serve the national interest.</p><p>Source: The White House, the United States</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Many vulnerable countries are being forced to respond to a crisis they did nothing to create, and he added that as the world's top emitters, G20 countries must lead the way in line with the principle of common-but-differentiated responsibilities.

And I am here at a critical time as South Africa assumes the presidency of the G20. He also touched upon the situation in the Middle East. He said that as we speak, we are witnessing the reshaping of the Middle East, with the changes in the correlation of forces among the key regional actors, with the immense tragedy of the Palestinian people whose right for self-determination - whose rights to have their own State - must be constantly reaffirmed. But we also see some signs of hope, and signs of hope mainly coming from the end of the Syrian dictatorship.</p><p>Following that, he went to the Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria. He had a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p><p>Amongst other topics, they discussed issues pertaining to the priorities of South Africa's presidency of the G20.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Secretary-General had an interview with SABC TV at his hotel in Pretoria.

Wars are causing enormous pain, suffering and displacement. Inequalities and divisions are rife - fuelling tensions and mistrust.</p><p>And today I can officially report that we have just endured a decade of deadly heat. The top ten 10 hottest years on record have happened in the last 10 years, including 2024. This is climate breakdown - in real time. We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose.</p><p>In 2025, countries must put the world on a safer path by dramatically slashing emissions and supporting the transition to a renewable future. It is essential - and it is possible.</p><p>Even in the darkest days, I've seen hope power change. I see hope in activists - young and old - raising their voices for progress. I see hope in the humanitarian heroes overcoming enormous obstacles to support the most vulnerable people. I see hope in developing countries fighting for financial and climate justice. I see hope in the scientists and innovators breaking new ground for humanity. And I saw hope in September, when world leaders came together to adopt the Pact for the Future.</p><p>The Pact is a new push to build peace through disarmament and prevention. To reform the global financial system so it supports and represents all countries. To push for more opportunities for women and young people. To build guardrails so technologies put people over profits and rights over runaway algorithms.

This could not be more timely. There is much uncertainty and instability in our world. But, today, we meet in the wake of some good news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just this morning, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) officially confirmed that 2024 was a record year for renewables additions to global power capacity. Renewables represented more than 92 per cent of all new electricity-generation capacity installed last year.</p><p>The amount of renewables added represents more than the total electricity capacity of Brazil and Japan combined. Europe's capacity grew by 9 per cent - with Germany contributing more than one quarter of that growth. Africa's capacity grew by almost 7 per cent.</p><p>All of this is another reminder of a twenty-first century truth: Renewables are renewing economies. They are powering growth, creating jobs, lowering energy bills and cleaning our air. And every day, they become an even smarter investment.</p><p>Since 2010, the average cost of wind power has plunged 60 per cent. Solar is 90 per cent cheaper. In 2023, clean energy sectors accounted for 5 per cent of economic growth in India and 6 [per cent] in the United States. It accounted for a fifth of China's GDP [gross domestic product] growth, and a third of the European Union's.</p><p>The economic case for - and opportunities of - climate action have become ever clearer - particularly for those who choose to lead. And leadership is what we need - as today's IRENA report shows:</p><p>To accelerate the shift to renewables and to correct the imbalances in the transition, which is still starving developing countries - outside China - of the investment needed to fully embrace clean energy.</p><p>As the title of this session puts it so well: we are indeed at a turning point to the future. In the 10 years since Paris, we have seen other important progress. Ninety per cent of global emissions are now covered by net-zero targets.</p><p>A decade ago, the planet was on course for a global temperature rise of over 4\\xB0C. Today, countries' national climate plans - or NDCs [nationally determined contributions] - if fully delivered - will take us closer to a 2.6\\xB0C rise.</p><p>At the same time, climate challenges are piling up. It seems records are shattered at every turn - the hottest day of the hottest month of the hottest year of the hottest decade ever.</p><p>All of this is hitting the vulnerable hardest, and everyday people in their pockets - with higher living costs, higher insurance premiums and higher food prices. Just last week, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2024 was another alarming year.</p><p>Almost every climate indicator reached new and increasingly dangerous heights - inflaming displacement and food insecurity and inflicting huge economic losses. And for the first time, the annual global temperature was 1.5\\xB0C hotter than pre-industrial times.</p><p>Scientists are clear: it is still possible to meet the long-term 1.5\\xB0C limit. But, it requires urgent action. And it requires leadership. I see two critical fronts to drive action.</p><p>First, new national climate plans - or NDCs - due by September. Investors need certainty and predictability. These new plans are a unique opportunity to deliver and lay out a coherent vision for a just green transition. They must align with the 1.5\\xB0C limit, as agreed at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]. And cover all emissions and the whole economy.</p><p>Together, they must reduce global emissions 60 per cent by 2035 compared to 2019 and contribute to the COP28 global energy transition goals.</p><p>All this must be achieved in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of national circumstances but everybody, everybody must do more. The Group of 20 (G20) - the largest emitters and economies - must lead.</p><p>Every country must step up and play their part. The United Nations is with you all. President Lula and I are working to secure the highest ambition from the largest economies.</p><p>The United Nations Climate Promise is supporting 100 countries to prepare their new climate plans. And we will convene a special event in September to take stock of the plans of all countries, push for action to keep 1.5\\xB0C within reach, and deliver climate justice.</p><p>Second, we must drive finance to developing countries. The COP29 finance agreement must be implemented in full. I count on the leadership of the COP29 and COP30 presidencies to deliver a credible road map to mobilize $1.3 trillion a year by 2035.</p><p>We need new and innovative sources of financing, and credible carbon pricing. Developed countries must honour their promise to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year, by this year.</p><p>And we need serious contributions to the fund for responding to loss and damage, and to get it up and running.</p><p>We can only meet these goals with stronger collaboration between Governments, and across society and sectors. Those that will lag behind need to be not a reason for us to be discouraged, but an increase in our commitment to move forward.</p><p>The rewards are there for the taking, for all those ready and willing to lead the world through these troubled times. We are at a turning point. I urge you to seize this moment; and seize the prize.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FF9-0BM3-RRVV-540T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 31, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPLV</classCode><className>RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1EZ</classCode><className>STARVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPLO</classCode><className>WIND ENERGY INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008WYU</classCode><className>COST OF LIVING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Fossil fuels make up about half of Azerbaijan's economy and the vast majority of its export revenues, with its state-owned oil and gas company a major source of income for President Ilham Aliyev's government.</p><p>However, this alarming footage once again reinforces the dangers of holding COP29 in a country that has close links to fossil fuel companies. Just as we saw with the UAE last year, the event's hosts have an agenda that is at serious odds with climate justice.</p><p>The international community has failed to rein in the deadly activities of the fossil fuel industry, which continues to pollute, burn, and ransack the planet in the face of mounting human suffering.</p><p>As global warming continues to increase, with 2024 set to be the first year above 1.5 degrees, COP29 is a critical opportunity for world leaders to break with these past failures. Yet for that to happen, officials need to be onboard and commit to fully phasing out fossil fuels, rather than using the event as an opportunity to broker dirty underhand deals, or to protect their domestic fossil fuel industry.</p><p>Going forward, Amnesty International is calling for a robust conflict of interest policy to prevent fossil fuel lobbyists undermining the aims of global climate treaties - and it needs to start now.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD2-YNP1-DXMS-84DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZBZ</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000367</classCode><className>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002007</classCode><className>PUBLIC SECTOR BUSINESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000632</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X0B</classCode><className>STATE OWNED BUSINESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSGI</classCode><className>FOSSIL FUELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001240</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DL4E</classCode><className>ILHAM ALIYEV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC569</classCode><className>AZERBAIJAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He had witnessed the tropical cyclone Chido crawling over the rooftops of houses he had always known. On December 14, 2024, after devastating the island of Mayotte, the cyclone hit the islands of Anjouan and Moh\\xE9li, causing floods, landslides, blackouts, and leaving families homeless. For small farmers, the impact was particularly severe: in a country where most people rely on subsistence agriculture, cyclone Chido caused extensive damage to crop. Today, months after the storm, the scars are still visible and, with the tropical cyclone season still underway, the fear of another catastrophe looms.</p><p>Nestled between Madagascar and Mozambique in the Indian Ocean, Comoros is among the world's most climate-vulnerable countries. More than half of its population-i.e., 54.2%-lives in at-risk areas and is particularly susceptible to natural disasters. In this part of the globe, climate change has increased the frequency and severity of cyclones, torrential rainfalls, and severe droughts. These disasters have tragically impacted the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations already living in poverty, disrupting basic infrastructures and public services and sometimes wiping out hard-earned development gains.</p><p>Readiness saves lives</p><p>In the wake of cyclone Chido, the Comorian authorities, with the support of the World Bank, swiftly mobilized emergency relief-food, water, temporary shelters, and emergency kits-to help the affected families. This quick reaction was made possible by Comoros's operational and financial emergency response system, which has been built by learning from previous disasters and aims at being capable of offering timely support to the population when a shock occurs.</p><p>In September 2024, Comoros, alongside Madagascar and Mozambique, joined the Regional Emergency Preparedness and Access to Inclusive Recovery Program (REPAIR), a regional climate risk fund established as a partnership between African Risk Capacity Limited (ARC Ltd, the African insurance risk pool) and the World Bank. This program, which is backed by a $926 million envelope from the International Development Association (IDA)/International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and Global Shield Financing Facility, is supporting 12 African countries in strengthening their financial preparedness to climate disasters and enabling them to deliver prompt assistance to the populations in distress. The REPAIR program is thus pioneering a truly African disaster response system through a platform that showcases how countries can join forces by pooling funds and knowledge to address the common challenges caused by climate change.</p><p>The recent experience of Comoros, the first country to activate the REPAIR program in response to an emergency, underscored a crucial lesson: how and when assistance reaches those in need is just as important as the funding itself. Comoros's experience with REPAIR demonstrated that rapid, well-coordinated responses can make all the difference. The coordination between ministries, civil protection agencies, and local communities was instrumental in delivering aid effectively-whether to households, farmers, or small firms that play a key role in the recovery process.</p><p>As Country Manager for Comoros, Boubacar-Sid had a chance to witness where the help went. The reality is that no one ever knows when the next disaster will strike. But what we do know is that preparedness saves lives. Working hand in hand with partner countries, we can provide better protection for vulnerable populations and lay the groundwork for inclusive recovery.</p><p>Over the rainbow</p><p>Looking forward, cyclone-hit Comoros has been capitalizing on its achievements with REPAIR by investing in climate resilience and improving contingency planning with experts from ARC Ltd. The goal is clear: to be better prepared before the next disaster hits. This March, Comoros will share its experience with nine other African countries at a regional workshop entirely dedicated to disaster risk finance organized in South Africa. This event will be a key milestone in accelerating climate adaptation efforts by bringing countries together to discuss strategies for a more resilient and livable planet.</p><p>The road ahead is challenging, but the actions taken today will shape the future. For Comoros and many vulnerable nations, resilience is not just an option-it is a necessity. Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to climate justice, countries across Africa can ensure that when the next natural disaster hits, communities are not left to rebuild alone.</p><p>This story was prepared by Boubacar-Sid Barry, Caroline Cerruti, Noro Andriamihaja and Lucas Herzog.</p><p>(World Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCJ-XYG3-RVYJ-T2P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 21, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0007BG3</classCode><className>ARC LTD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

It is now more essential than ever that the finance required to prevent greater heating, and to allow communities to adapt to the realities of climate change, is significantly scaled up. Failing to act will only increase the costs - both to human rights and to economies.</p><p>People in low-income countries are worst affected by this crisis and have the least means to deal with it. The polluters must pay. This means the largest historical emitters of greenhouse gases, and others states which can afford to - including some major fossil fuel producing countries - providing more climate finance to lower-income states.</p><p>The only sure answer to tackling the root cause of global warming is to rapidly phase out fossil fuels, and to fund a fair, fast and forever phase out and shift to renewable sources of power. We are urging parties at the UN Climate Conference in Bonn this week to set a clear path to far greater provision of climate finance.</p><p>Background</p><p>The Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European Union's global climate monitoring service, recorded that May 2024 was the warmest May on record globally. The global average temperature for May 2024 was 1.52\\xB0C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, marking the 11th consecutive month (since July 2023) at or above 1.5\\xB0C, which was the level countries agreed in Paris in 2016 to act to try and stay below. The global average temperature for the last 12 months from June 2023 to May 2024 is the highest on record, at 1.63\\xB0C above the 1850-1900 average. Even if countries were to implement the greenhouse gas reduction commitments they have already made, the planet is on track for almost 3\\xB0C of warming this century.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C6K-FRG1-JB5P-J039-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"368\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 10, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZBZ</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

waters</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Agriculture (DA), through the Office of the Solicitor General, has asked the Supreme Court (SC) to overturn a decision allowing commercial fishing vessels to operate in municipal waters meant for fisherfolk.</p><p>In its motion for reconsideration, the DA reiterated its commitment to protecting the interests of small-scale fishers while conserving marine resources, and urged the SC to reconsider its ruling to ensure the sustainability of the country's fisheries and coastal communities.</p><p>Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. made the disclosure during a meeting with various organizations, including the Federation of Free Farmers, Oceana Philippines, Magsasaka Partylist, the National Anti-Poverty Commission, and the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, to discuss the ruling's implications, according to a DA news release on Friday.</p><p>The DA chief expressed concerns about the decision's potential adverse effects on the livelihood of small fishers and its impact on marine ecosystems.</p><p>At a depth of seven fathoms, or 12 meters, corals are at risk, and our scarce marine resources could face further depletion, Tiu Laurel said.</p><p>The high court's First Division, in a resolution dated Aug. 19, 2024, upheld a Malabon Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision declaring the Fisheries Code's preferential access provisions unconstitutional.</p><p>The Malabon RTC had rendered the ruling in the suit filed by private Navotas-based commercial fishing firm, Mercidar Fishing Corp., which filed a petition for declaratory relief on Oct. 25, 2023.</p><p>Among the portions of the Fisheries Code invalidated by the Malabon court was Sec. 16 on the jurisdiction of the municipal government to regulate commercial fishing in municipal waters of up to 15 km. from the shoreline.</p><p>The RTC also struck down the outright ban on commercial fishing in waters with a depth of less than seven fathoms.</p><p>Oceana Philippines vice president Gloria Estenzo-Ramos said the ruling could devastate marine resources, as commercial vessels would be allowed to fish in nearly 90 percent of coastal waters, threatening marine ecosystems</p><p>Tracking devices, such as the Vessel Monitoring System, would become irrelevant, she said.</p><p>The Vessel Monitoring System is designed to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing incidents in the country's territorial waters.</p><p>Meanwhile, Laurel cited the DA's efforts to support small fishers through initiatives such as providing solar-powered ice plants and fish processing facilities.</p><p>He also stressed the importance of sustainable fishing practices, including standardizing net sizes to prevent overfishing. - PNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Nearly half of the classrooms in the capital, Manila, remained empty at the beginning of the past school week as officials reacted to a weather advisory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In April and May 2024, scorching temperatures led to almost daily cancellations of in-person classes, sometimes across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But these young people are not alone. At least 242 million students globally had their education disrupted by extreme weather in 2024, according to UNICEF. That includes heat waves, tropical cyclones, storms, floods and droughts - all of which are intensifying with climate change. Almost three quarters of the affected students live in low- and lower-middle-income countries.</p><p>'It can be life-altering'</p><p>Around a billion children are living in countries extremely vulnerable to environmental and climate shocks, said UNICEF, where events like storms or floods often upend lives, destroying entire neighborhoods, roads or even schools. School buildings that do stay intact sometimes double as shelters, which also delays the return to classes.</p><p>Though some educational facilities could technically stay open during events like heat waves, high temperatures can make it difficult for students to focus or take in information.</p><p>\"It can be a small event, but it can also be life-altering,\" said Megan Kuhfeld, a senior research scientist at NWEA, a company providing education services in the US. \"For many children, routine and predictability are more important than for adults. They don't necessarily have the coping skills to handle anything that disrupts this.\"</p><p>An academic setback</p><p>Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate justice activist from the Philippines, experienced these disruptions firsthand as a teenager. In 2009, two major typhoons, Ketsana and Parma, interrupted her schooling in a way that trickled down for years.</p><p>\"When it was time to apply for universities, there was a big chunk of stuff we hadn't learned. So, we had to do a crash course just to be able to take the entrance exams,\" said Tan, who went on to study at the University of the Philippines Diliman.</p><p>NWEA's Kuhfeld analyzed different US studies that examine the correlation between the time students were absent from school - not necessarily because of climate extremes - and how far behind they are in their learning.</p><p>She found that length of absence and impact on learning didn't map onto each other one to one. So, for example, a week of missed classes could set students back several weeks depending on their circumstances.</p><p>One thing that does play a role in the impact of missing classes is how far a child is in their school career. Middle school curricula are more advanced than elementary ones, building on what students already know. So missing classes then makes it harder to keep up.</p><p>However, Kuhfeld also noted that the studies she analyzed on absenteeism due to inclement weather observed more significant learning setbacks than the other studies. Possibly because many of these students are also dealing with the stress of recovering from a natural disaster.</p><p>\"This is probably picking up on the fact that it's not just about missing school. There are other mental health aspects at play,\" she said.</p><p>Back to school. But how?</p><p>Once schools reopen, teachers can't necessarily pick right up where they left off, because going back to class is about more than fixing infrastructure.</p><p>\"The schools, the buildings are getting destroyed, but the learners themselves are also impacted,\" said Pia Rebello Britto, Global Director of Education and Adolescent Development at UNICEF. \"If you start feeling like you are falling behind, you start to lose that motivation and engagement.\"</p><p>And this lack of motivation can hit people who are already disadvantaged especially hard. In Pakistan's Sindh Province, Britto said she saw how hard it was for girls to stay engaged after floods closed their schools because their education is already not being promoted very much.</p><p>In the Philippines, climate activist Tan knows of low-income students who must choose between returning to class or supporting their families.</p><p>\"If their house has been completely flooded and destroyed, it's very hard to ask the student to go to school and learn about something that seems so far removed from their reality,\" she said.</p><p>How to make education more resilient as the planet heats up</p><p>Education experts agree that the school system has to become more climate resilient, though that is also a question of finances.</p><p>In many ways, they can prepare to be more flexible. Schools can come up with contingency plans if the building is damaged, like moving classes to churches or public halls. They can also adapt the school calendar to avoid months where extreme weather is more likely.</p><p>Heat waves have disrupted schools in the Philippines partly because the calendar had been altered to synchronize it with other countries. That meant students are in class during the peak of the dry, hot season in April and May. Now the government is changing the schedule back.</p><p>However, the most important step is to make schools and students resilient. That means climate-proofing the buildings by insulating them or building them with materials that naturally regulate temperature, elevating them to protect them from flooding and building sturdier roofs to withstand cyclone winds.</p><p>It also means arming students with better information about climate change in the curricula. That way they can make sense of what happened to them and the role that burning fossil fuels played in causing climate change and fueling extreme weather.</p><p>\"It's important they learn about it in a contextualized way so that they see it's something that cuts across all sectors of life and that they can participate in policymaking and policy changing,\" said Tan. \"They represent the generations forward.\"</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F9H-T0S3-RRJF-355B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 11, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

The annual emissions report from the UN Environment Programme found that without significant changes, the world is on track for a catastrophic increase of 2.6 to 3.1\\xB0C this century. If we do not take bold, decisive and collective action today, tomorrow's world will be increasingly unlivable. From droughts and wildfires to floods and supercharged storms, these devastating unnatural disasters have become far too often a regular feature of people's lives the world over. They are bound to increase in scale, reach and intensity, ending far more lives, destroying livelihoods, and fueling unprecedented levels of famine and forced migration. It's not too late to avert total climate breakdown, but we cannot waste another minute, said Agn\\xE8s Callamard, Amnesty International's Secretary General.</p><p>States must build on the COP28 decision and commit to a full, fast, fair and funded fossil fuel phaseout. This will require agreement on a vastly scaled-up climate finance target to help fund just transitions to zero-carbon economies in lower income states - at least one trillion USD per year. The current lack of progress towards agreement on this issue is shocking. One trillion USD may seem expensive, but the human rights and economic costs of maintaining the status quo are incalculable. The fate of humanity depends upon it.</p><p>The high-income countries who share the greatest responsibility for the climate crisis must negotiate in good faith to achieve an ambitious and adequate target and deliver on their commitments. They must also substantially increase financing for adaptation to the significant climate harm that's already here and will worsen very quickly, and to the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage to help the people worst impacted by the effects of global heating.</p><p>Azerbaijan will host the 29th Conference of Parties (COP29) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Baku from 11 to 22 November. More than 190 parties to the treaty will discuss issues such as a new global goal for climate finance; targets for ending greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through fossil fuel phaseout; just transitions to zero-carbon economies; and how to support measures to reduce climate harms and address unavoidable loss and damage in lower income states that are bearing the brunt of climate harms while having contributed the least to creating them.</p><p>Amnesty International will have delegates at COP29 from 9 to 24 November, who will be available for interviews about the need to centre climate-action decisions in human rights, and the Azerbaijani government's ongoing assault on civil society.</p><p>In light of the inadequate human rights protections in the Host Country Agreement, states must also take steps to protect freedom of expression and peaceful protest for all participants at COP29 and to limit the pernicious influence of fossil fuel lobbyists who will be ubiquitous at COP. Azerbaijan has a terrible track record in terms of respect for freedom of expression and dissent. It is therefore all the more important that these rights are protected in the official UN space. Both the UNFCCC Secretariat and parties must do much more than what they have done in the UAE or Egypt to ensure the safety, security and rights of all, said Agn\\xE8s Callamard.</p><p>In October 2024, Amnesty International published an advocacy briefing with recommendations for parties to the UNFCCC and to the Paris Agreement. In line with the global climate justice movement, the organization is highlighting the urgent need for massively increased public climate financing that is accessible to those countries and communities in need.</p><p>Amnesty International calls on COP29 delegates and the UNFCCC Secretariat to implement these recommendations, which include:</p><p>- Put human rights at the heart of all climate action decision making to ensure a rapid, equitable and just transition to zero carbon economies and protect the rights of all to life, health, food, water, sanitation, housing, decent work and a clean, healthy and sustainable environment without discrimination, which are essential to achieving climate justice.</p><p>- Massively scale up climate finance, particularly for adaptation and loss and damage, in the form of grants, not loans, with those most responsible for emissions contributing the most.</p><p>- Commit to a full, fast, fair, and funded fossil fuel phase out across all sectors, without relying on risky and unproven technologies or offsets that do not lead to genuine emissions reductions.</p><p>- Develop new, human rights-compliant Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that will keep global warming below 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels, with high-income historical emitters, other high-emitting G20 countries, and other high-income fossil fuel producers going furthest and fastest.</p><p>- Protect the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly for all participants at COP29 which is held in Azerbaijan, where freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly are severely restricted and adopt a robust Conflict of Interest policy to limit the influence of the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DC6-H8H1-DXMS-815F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 8, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

But no foreign nation is entitled to those benefits, and no foreign aid program is above scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The previously announced 90-day pause and review of U.S. foreign aid is already paying dividends to our country and our people. We are rooting out waste. We are blocking woke programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs remained on autopilot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous. And that is exactly what we are doing right now - prioritizing America's core national interests one dollar at a time.</p><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><p>How much does the United States spend annually on foreign aid?</p><p>Even setting aside generous support for Ukraine over the past several years, the U.S. is spending roughly $40 billion in foreign aid annually. That is more than the GDP of multiple U.S. states and accounts for four out of every 10 dollars in global humanitarian aid. Americans deserve transparency and accountability for every dollar we spend, especially when it is spent abroad instead of at home.</p><p>Why did the U.S. State Department initiate a 90-day pause on foreign aid?</p><p>It is impossible to evaluate programs on autopilot because the participants - both inside and outside of government - have little to no incentive to share programmatic-level details so long as the dollars continue to flow. A temporary pause, with commonsense waivers for truly life-threatening situations, is the only way to scrutinize and prevent waste.</p><p>What type of spending has been prevented by the pause?</p><p>Without the pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms (and other contraceptive services) in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji, support for gender development programs, family planning throughout Latin America, sex education and pro-abortion programs for young girls globally, and much more. These types of programs do not make America stronger, safer, or more prosperous.</p><p>What type of funding is permitted to move forward?</p><p>The original order, dated January 24, 2025, contained several important exceptions, including emergency food assistance, and outlined the process to secure additional exceptions. Requests were reviewed and, where needed, approved within hours. Subsequently, the Secretary approved a broad waiver on January 28, 2025, for humanitarian aid, which is defined as life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.</p><p>Have any waivers been granted for non-humanitarian assistance?</p><p>Critical national security waivers have been granted, including to ensure the protection of U.S. personnel overseas, facilitate the repatriation of illegal aliens, enforce non-proliferation obligations, and much more. As mentioned, exceptions were reviewed and, where needed, approved within hours.</p><p>What is the process to secure a waiver?</p><p>The Department provided straight forward guidance on January 24, 2025, encouraging bureaus that manage foreign assistance to send waiver requests with the following information:</p><p>Bureau/Office/Mission Name</p><p>Program Name</p><p>Program Description</p><p>Program Location(s)</p><p>Intended Programmatic Outcome</p><p>Justification for Waiver</p><p>Fiscal and Earmark information</p><p>That process was used successfully dozens of times in the first several days alone; however, many requests failed to provide the level of detail necessary to allow a thorough evaluation. Subsequent guidance, sent on January 28, 2025, encouraged implementing partners and NGOs to work through their U.S. government agency partners on any additional requests.</p><p>How much has this process saved U.S. taxpayers?</p><p>In just a few days, the Department received billions of dollars in waiver requests. Many of those requests are still under a merit-based review as they are not considered emergency or life threatening; however, even at this early stage, over $1,000,000,000 in spending not aligned with an America First agenda has been prevented.</p><p>Source: U.S. Department of State</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1R-P9G3-RRNW-B4RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 3, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Security</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ2QjVCNUE0MTUzNDcxNzgxNjk3ODkwNzE0RkJDQTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzgyNTlGMzg1QkU1NEY0MEE0Mzc3ODk0N0M2MDY1RTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DLNH</classCode><className>FOREIGN AID</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp;

For us, this is climate justice.</p><p>Borje said climate action should be anchored on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and climate justice.</p><p>He also emphasized the need to put a premium on Global Stocktake, a mechanism assessing global response to climate crisis; accelerated adaptation action; loss and damage from climate change; target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius; and climate financing.</p><p>On Wednesday, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said that for the first time ever, global temperatures are likely to breach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming within the next five years.</p><p>The WMO also said there is a 98 percent chance that within the next five years, the world will experience the hottest on record, surpassing 2016 when global temperature impacted by about 1.3C (2.3F) of warming.</p><p>It is only through global collective action that we can transform our developing countries' vulnerabilities, and avert, minimize and address existing losses and damages in order to achieve climate resilience, Borje said.</p><p>As part of the collective efforts in attaining the global climate agenda, Borje ensured the Philippines' support for the CVF and the so-called V20 (Vulnerable 20), a group of 20 nations that are most vulnerable to the climate crisis.</p><p>The CCC and our allies in Congress, most especially Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda who also serves as a CVF Ambassador for Parliaments, remain committed to the work of CVF and V20 in promoting ambitious climate action to safeguard the world's most vulnerable, developing nations, Borje said.</p><p>The CVF, currently chaired by Ghana, is composed of 58 vulnerable nations, including the Philippines.</p><p>In 2015, the Philippines chaired the CVF.

(they) have not taken responsibility for environmental and biodiversity degradation (in Cura\\xE7ao),\" Gilberto Morishaw, a climate activist from Cura\\xE7ao who is now based in The Hague, told Euronews.</p><p>Climate change is hurting Cura\\xE7ao in myriad ways: from coral bleaching that jeopardises local fisheries and tourism to extreme heat and heavy rainfall, which threatens food security, public health and local infrastructure, according to Morishaw.</p><p>Yet consistent cash and concrete commitments from the Netherlands are in short supply, he said.</p><p>\"The Dutch government has thrown most of the responsibility for climate adaptation into the laps of the territories themselves, and are extremely flaky with regards to funding and implementation,\" Morishaw added.</p><p>'Between a rock and a hard place'</p><p>Based in The Hague, the ICJ, which is also known as the World Court, will hear arguments until next Friday and is set to deliver a judgement next year.</p><p>The advisory opinion it gives, while non-binding, could have a huge impact on domestic climate-related litigation worldwide and influence diplomacy and negotiations at events such as the annual COP conferences, according to environmental experts.</p><p>\"The ICJ proceedings and the forthcoming advisory opinion the potential to set a strong foundation for accountability and to send a clear message that big polluters cannot negotiate their way out of their legal obligations,\" said Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).</p><p>The judges will consider two questions, including whether countries that have \"caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment\" may be legally responsible for damage done to small island developing states.</p><p>Known as SIDS, this grouping of 39 states and 18 associate members (Cura\\xE7ao is among the latter) are considered by the UN to be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>One of these states - the Pacific nation Vanuatu, which requested the ICJ case - will open the proceedings. In total, 98 states and 12 international organisations will present their arguments to the ICJ.</p><p>Several SIDS and some small island associations are among them, but Cura\\xE7ao and Mayotte are not on the agenda. Representatives from the Netherlands and France will participate, and Morishaw and his counterparts in Mayotte hope that the ICJ case will ultimately spur the colonial powers into paying more attention to small island states.</p><p>\"The ICJ must cover the obligations that states have towards their territories, independent of what internal status they have,\" said Morishaw.</p><p>\"I hope the ICJ and other institutions start recognising the plight of countries like ours who are stuck between a rock and a hard place.\"</p><p>Criticism of COP29 deal</p><p>The ICJ hearings, which were requested by the UN General Assembly in April of last year, are being held just weeks after the COP29 summit in Baku, which culminated in a climate financing deal that was criticised as grossly insufficient by developing nations.</p><p>The agreement will see wealthier nations provide $300 billion (284bn) annually by 2035 to fund emissions reductions and climate adaptation in poorer nations.</p><p>While it is triple the amount pledged under a previous climate finance deal, which expires next year, it falls well short of the $500 billion (474bn) to $1.3 trillion (1.2tr) range that developing nations had been demanding from leading governments' public purses.</p><p>Two associations of especially climate-vulnerable nations - the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the Least Developed Countries - briefly walked out of the COP29 negotiations in protest, which almost saw the final agreement collapse.</p><p>\"At COP29, we found ourselves constantly insulted by the lack of inclusion - our calls and requests for action have been totally ignored,\" said Flora Vano, Vanuatu Country Manager for ActionAid. She is set to speak on behalf of Vanuatu at the ICJ hearings.</p><p>Activists from developing nations said they were not only frustrated by the headline sum but also a failure to build on the previous COP's promise to transition away from fossil fuels, given the disproportionate impacts of emissions on small and developing nations.</p><p>The UN Environment Programme's annual Emissions Gap report, published in October, found that global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 1.3% between 2022 and 2023. G20 members (minus the African Union) accounted for 77% of emissions last year, while the 47 least developed countries combined were responsible for just 3%, the UN said.</p><p>There was also concern among activists and representatives from SIDS that the COP29 deal did not include a commitment to give funding in grants rather than loans. Since 2016, about 70% of public climate finance has been delivered in the form of loans, which is a worry for many developing countries, and SIDS is facing ever-greater debt burdens.</p><p>The world's 58 poorest and most climate-vulnerable states spent $59 billion (56bn) repaying debts in 2022 compared with $28 billion (26bn) they received in climate finance, said the International Institute for Environment and Development, a think tank.</p><p>\"When a drought, flood or major storm hits, the least developed countries and SIDS are forced into a vicious cycle of borrowing more money to support their people and rebuild their infrastructure, further compounding debts,\" it said in research published in October.</p><p>Catalyst for climate change cases?</p><p>Despite the frustrations surrounding the latest COP, representatives from SIDS such as Vanuatu and climate legal experts have expressed optimism that the ICJ hearings could prove a catalyst for more environmental litigation globally, and ultimately, climate justice.</p><p>There has been an uptick this year in court and tribunal rulings around the world demanding that states do more to curb emissions and protect the environment.</p><p>In May, the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea, a UN court on maritime law, said greenhouse gases constitute marine pollution and that countries must protect oceans.</p><p>The previous month, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruled that state inaction on climate change violates fundamental human rights in a case brought by a group of older Swiss women concerned about the health impacts of global warming.</p><p>And in January, residents of the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire - which is located about 80 kilometres away from Cura\\xE7ao, and has been a special municipality of the Netherlands since 2010 - filed a lawsuit against the Dutch government requesting that it do more to protect the island from the effects of climate change.</p><p>The ICJ proceedings will be closely watched because there is a lack of legal precedent on climate change impacts. Reisch of CIEL said the hearings would not only open the governments of major polluters to public scrutiny of their legal positions on the issue but also galvanise climate-vulnerable territories and communities' push for accountability.</p><p>\"The process itself is a vital platform to spotlight the grave impacts and real lives on the line, and a powerful springboard for communities coming together across nations and across generations, under the leadership of youth from the Pacific and beyond, to demand climate justice and a livable future for all,\" Reisch told Euronews.</p><p>One activist who is striving to do so is Samira Ben Ali, a climate justice advocate from Mayotte in the Indian Ocean. She said climate change was threatening the French territory on multiple fronts, from ocean acidification that could wipe out coral ecosystems within decades to prolonged droughts that are fuelling a water crisis.</p><p>\"From drinking water to traditional fishing practices, every aspect of life and basic human rights in Mayotte is being affected (by the climate crisis),\" said the Paris-based Ben Ali, who works as a coordinator for the World's Youth for Climate Justice campaign.</p><p>While the French government is funding Mayotte's climate adaptation plan, Ben Ali said more investment is needed in climate solutions such as mangrove and coral planting and building dams to combat coastal erosion, as well as more capacity building generally.</p><p>For Ben Ali, an ICJ recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of non-self-governing territories could bolster Mayotte's case for more robust climate action from France, be it through holding fossil fuel companies to account for their emissions to better recognising the climate needs of local communities and bolstering adaptation measures overseas.</p><p>\"Mayotte, like other vulnerable territories, deserves more than symbolic promises,\" Ben Ali told Euronews.</p><p>\"France and others that have historically benefited from the production of greenhouse gas emissions causing the current climate crisis, must act with urgency to support those who are on the frontlines and have done the least to create this situation,\" she added.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJS-0H41-DXMS-808S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 4, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Admiralty &amp;

He said he is most concerned for the beneficiaries of programs he's been associated with over the years.</p><p>These are families who were anticipating they could get support. ... This will stop. ... There are children who are HIV-positive, and we always collaborate with their facilities to ensure that they are viral-suppressed. Now they'll be of high viral load, the man said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the administration issued waivers on existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs, including core life-saving medicine, which may apply to health programs such as PEPFAR, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which works with partners in 55 countries worldwide. One of them is South Africa, where 7.8 million people have HIV/AIDS.</p><p>Asanda Ngoasheng, an independent political analyst from South Africa, said the nation is the biggest beneficiary of the PEPFAR program, and has been for many years. ... It will have dire consequences for people in the region because there are some people who come to South Africa to receive some medication. ... So, it's a medical disaster in waiting, effectively, and a humanitarian disaster in waiting.</p><p>Addressing a press conference broadcast live on SABC on Wednesday, South African Health Minister Dr. Pakishe Motsoaledi said he hopes withdrawn aid will not affect antiretroviral treatments.</p><p>One thing we want to ascertain is that nobody must stop taking ARVs, Motsoaledi said. That will be devastating. ... When you are on ARVs and you stop, there will be serious trouble.</p><p>Through PEPFAR, the U.S. has invested over $110 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, saving over 25 million lives and preventing millions of HIV infections since it was established more than two decades ago by President George W. Bush, according to U.S. State Department data.</p><p>There are other programs that can't afford a funding break, said Dr. Akila Udoji, manager of Karu Primary Healthcare Center, a Nigerian facility sponsored by USAID.</p><p>Tuberculosis diagnosis treatment, if that funding is cut off, it will greatly affect the program because there won't be any diagnosis of such cases and then the medicines, people can't afford them, Udoji said. And if they can't afford it, it will lead to serious outbreaks of these diseases.</p><p>The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, an advocacy group, welcomed the administration's review of foreign assistance programs in a statement but expressed some concerns.</p><p>Former commander of U.S. Central Command Anthony Zinni, who is co-chair of the council of nearly 270 retired admirals and generals, warned that the freeze takes the U.S. off the playing field and could directly affect U.S. military operations overseas.</p><p>VOA requested interviews with the USAID offices in Kenya, Nigeria and the U.S. but did not receive replies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 90-day freeze is already paying dividends, a statement released by the U.S. State Department said this week.</p><p>It said the review has already prevented over $1 billion in spending not aligned with the administration's America First agenda, including programs providing certain contraceptive, climate justice, clean energy and abortion programs and services.</p><p>VOA's Kate Bartlett in South Africa and Timothy Obiezu in Nigeria contributed to this report. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F20-4B83-RV71-84YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 4, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000051</classCode><className>AIDS &amp;

Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity, Thunberg said.</p><p>After the Palestinian and Afghan women spoke and Thunberg resumed her speech, a man came onto the stage and told her: I have come here for a climate demonstration, not a political view, before he was ushered off the stage.</p><p>Thunberg wrestled the mic back off the man, told him to \"calm down\", then joined the crowd in chanting: \"No climate justice on occupied land\".</p><p>Who interrupted Greta Thunberg on stage?</p><p>The man's identity was not immediately clear. He was wearing a jacket with the name of a group called Water Natuurlijk that has elected members in Dutch water boards.</p><p>The Afghan woman, Sahar Shirzad, told news agency The Associated Press that Thunberg allowed them to take the stage with her.</p><p>Basically, she gave her time to us, she said.</p><p>Before Thunberg took the stage, the event was briefly interrupted as a small group of activists at the front of the crowd waved Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans.</p><p>She appeared undeterred and was later seen dancing behind the stage as band played.</p><p>The Netherlands' biggest ever climate protest</p><p>The incident came after tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of Amsterdam calling for more action to tackle climate change, in a mass protest just 10 days before a national election.</p><p>Organisers claimed that 70,000 people took part in the march and called it the biggest climate protest ever in the Netherlands.</p><p>Thunberg was among those walking through the historic heart of the Dutch capital.</p><p>Political leaders including former European Union climate chief Frans Timmermans, who now leads a centre-left, two-party bloc in the election campaign, later addressed the crowd gathered on a square behind the landmark Rijksmuseum.</p><p>\"We live in a time of crises, all of which are the result of the political choices that have been made. It has to be done and it can be done differently, organisers of the Climate Crisis Coalition said in a statement.</p><p>While the coalition included the Fridays for Future youth movement, protesters were all ages and included a large contingent of medics in white coats carrying a banner emblazoned with the text: Climate crisis = health crisis.</p><p>I am a paediatrician. I'm here standing up for the rights of children,\" said Laura Sonneveld. Children are the first to be affected by climate change.</p><p>Tackling climate change is one of the key policy areas for political parties contesting the 22 November general election.</p><p>It is time for us to protest about government decisions,\" said Margje Weijs, a Spanish teacher and youth coach. I hope this influences the election.\"</p><p>How have other climate groups responded to the Israel-Hamas war?</p><p>This isn't the first time climate protesters have spoken out for Palestine since the Israel-Hamas war broke out last month - though groups are divided on how to approach the issue.</p><p>On 23 October, 19 activists from environmental movement Extinction Rebellion were detained following a protest at The Hague. Protesters held signs stating Israeli PM Benjamin \"Netanyahu is a war criminal and demanded the Dutch government halt military cooperation with Israel.</p><p>Thunberg has also posted extensively on social media in solidarity with Palestine, while also condemning antisemitism.</p><p>Fridays for Future Sweden has also dedicated recent climate strikes to demanding a ceasefire, protecting civilians and providing humanitarian aid in Palestine. In a post on X on 26 October, they said \"We condemn all war crimes against civilians carried out by both Israel and Hamas.\"</p><p>While also condemning violence on both sides, Germany's arm of Fridays for Future has particularly expressed solidarity with Jewish victims of Hamas's attacks. The group, which has locked horns with the global organisation over its stance on Israel in the past, has distanced itself from criticising the country's actions.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69MV-VDN1-JB5P-J0WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs remained on autopilot.\"</p><p>The president, who said Wednesday at the White House that he \"could stand here all day\" and give examples of wasted fraud and abuse in the U.S. government, highlighted a few.</p><p>\"We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,\" he said. \"Fifty million. And you know what's happened to them? They've used them as a method of making bombs. How about that?\"</p><p>The State Department echoed this, saying in a statement, \"Without the pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms [and other contraceptive services] in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji, gender development programs in D.C., family planning throughout Latin America, sex education and pro-abortion programs for young girls globally, and much more. These types of programs do not make America stronger, safer or more prosperous.\"</p><p>A day earlier, the State Department sent a memo citing examples of unworthy projects, including $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International Medical Corps' work in war-battered Gaza.</p><p>A USAID report says the agency delivered about $7 million worth of male condoms and about $1 million in female condoms in the 2023 fiscal year. In total, the agency said it disbursed nearly 138 million male condoms and 1.7 million female condoms worldwide.</p><p>Under USAID, the main administrator for U.S. foreign development funds, the bulk of contraceptive items were delivered to African countries, according to the report. Jordan was the only country in the Middle East to receive a shipment, which consisted of injectable and oral contraceptives valued at $45,680.</p><p>'Dramatic overreach'</p><p>At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers not only affirmed the need for accountability but also emphasized that Congress, not the White House, decides how U.S. taxpayer money is spent.</p><p>\"I think it's appropriate to have a review,\" said Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican.</p><p>\"It would be my hope, however, that the aid can be reinstated and flow to Ukraine,\" Cramer said. \"And then we'll see in the next appropriation cycle whether or not Congress still has the will to continue that aid.\"</p><p>\"This is dramatic overreach by the White House, by the president,\" said Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat. \"It's unprecedented, uncalled for.

This will include government representatives from all UN member states, as well as the State of Palestine, the Holy See, Niue, the Cook Islands, and the European Union. All of these are parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and most have also joined the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. COP29 will also host diplomats, UN officials, journalists, climate scientists, trade union leaders, and policy experts. NGOs, activists, and Indigenous leaders are also planning to participate - although the involvement of independent media workers and human rights defenders from Azerbaijan itself has been curbed by an ongoing government crackdown.</p><p>2. What is the aim of COP29?</p><p>The overall aim of COP29 is for states to agree, develop and share plans for addressing climate change. This means preventing further global warming, and also helping those who have been most affected so far to adapt or to rebuild their lives.</p><p>In 2015, the Paris Agreement made it a legal requirement for all states to set targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, in order to limit the global temperature increase to 2\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, however, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) has stressed that the most catastrophic effects of climate change can only be avoided if we limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C by the end of this century.</p><p>At COP29, countries' progress on addressing climate change will be measured against this 1.5\\xB0C goal. It is important to note that even 1.5\\xB0C of warming will entail mass displacement, harm to livelihoods, and loss of life, with lower-income countries the worst affected. At present, the world is on track for an increase of 2.6 to 3.1\\xB0C this century.</p><p>3. What's on the agenda this year?</p><p>COP29 has been called the finance COP, due to its focus on scaling up climate finance. Climate finance refers to the funding that is needed to help lower-income countries transition to zero-carbon economies, and to help the most affected communities adapt to the effects of climate change. A major objective of COP29 is to increase this funding and to produce a new goal for future climate finance.</p><p>4. Where will that money come from?</p><p>Under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, the funding must come from the high-income countries that are historically most responsible for climate change. In addition, under international human rights law, all states in a position to do so must also contribute.</p><p>In addition to setting a financial target, COP29 negotiators must also agree clear timeframes for the provision of funds to lower-income countries. Money should be given in the form of grants, not loans, to avoid worsening existing debt crises.</p><p>5. What should the funds be used for?</p><p>This target should also contain sub-goals to make clear where the money should go. For example, Amnesty International is also calling for the target to include loss and damage finance. This is essentially compensation, paid by high-income countries to lower income ones, to help them recover from the existing impacts of climate change, and from others that they will unavoidably face in the future.</p><p>One of the Azerbaijan presidency's more positive moves has been to make adaptation, long sidelined in climate negotiations, a priority of the talks. While preventing further climate change through a full, fast fair and funded phase -out of fossil fuels is critical, the reality is that climate change is already here. Helping people adjust to existing and future impacts of global warming is a crucial part of climate justice.</p><p>6. How much money is needed?</p><p>Trillions of dollars are needed to help lower-income states carry out the climate action needed, including transitioning away from fossil fuels in a way that protects peoples' rights. Amnesty International and others in the climate justice movement are calling for a target of at least 1 trillion USD annually.</p><p>Azerbaijan has an alarming human rights record, with longstanding restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly.</p><p>7. What are Amnesty's human rights concerns regarding Azerbaijan?</p><p>Azerbaijan has an alarming human rights record, with longstanding restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. Peaceful protests, including those held by environmental groups, are routinely met with violent suppression, and according to the local NGOs more than 300 people are currently imprisoned on politically motivated charges. The work of independent media outlets in Azerbaijan is severely hampered by draconian laws, and the constant threat of retaliation for any real or perceived criticism of the authorities. Most independent media outlets have been crushed out of existence, as have vast swathes of Azerbaijan's civil society. Torture and other ill-treatment in detention are widespread in Azerbaijan, and impunity is entrenched.</p><p>8. Have there been any improvements since Azerbaijan was given the COP29 Presidency?</p><p>No. In fact, the grave human rights situation in Azerbaijan has worsened sincethe country was announced as the host of COP29 in December 2023. The authorities claim they are ensuring everyone's voices are heard at the summit - but they have prosecuted more than a dozen activists and journalists this year, and silenced key voices on the climate crisis.</p><p>In April, for example, Azerbaijani authorities arrested human rights and climate justice activist Anar Mammadli on bogus smuggling charges, and placed him in pre-trial detention, where he remains. Anar Mammadli was among the first activists in Azerbaijan to speak about the connection between human rights and climate justice, and he has been involved in international advocacy at the EU and UN level. In prison he has been denied adequate medical treatment for several worsening health conditions, and he is facing a lengthy sentence.</p><p>9. How does the human rights situation in Azerbaijan affect COP29?</p><p>It is essential that civil society can participate in climate negotiations. Activists, union leaders, and human rights defenders help to advocate for ambitious targets and play a vital role in ensuring that the plans developed at COP29 align with governments' human rights obligations and that they are actually implemented. But the involvement of Azerbaijan's own civil society is likely to be extremely limited. Threats and harassment have forced many local activists to leave the country, while others are arbitrarily detained on politically motivated charges. The few remaining independent voices risk prosecution and retaliation if they dare to voice any criticism during COP29.</p><p>The void left by local civil society groups has been filled in part by organizations known as GONGOs (government-organized non-governmental organizations). These state-supported groups do not provide the independent perspectives needed, but their presence allows Azerbaijani authorities to project a false picture of respect for freedom of expression and association.</p><p>Amnesty International is monitoring the crackdown in Azerbaijan, and will continue to document violations, both during and after the summit.</p><p>10 .What about Azerbaijan's record on climate change?</p><p>Fossil fuel makes up about half of Azerbaijan's economy and the vast majority of its export revenues. The state-owned oil and gas company, SOCAR, is a major source of income for President Ilham Aliyev's government. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan must also do its fair share to achieve a fast and fair fossil fuel phase out; this means no new fossil fuel projects anywhere. But earlier this year, President Aliyev announced plans for expanding gas production which are grossly incompatible with Azerbaijan's commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Like previous climate summits, COP29 will host many participants whose agendas are seriously at odds with climate justice. Thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists, along with the heads of oil giants like Shell and BP, are expected to be in attendance. These participants have used previous summits to advance their own interests, opposing essential efforts to phase out fossil fuels and pushing for false solutions like carbon offsetting. Amnesty International is calling for a robust conflict of interest policy to prevent fossil fuel lobbyists undermining the aims of global climate treaties.</p><p>11. How has climate change impacted people in 2024?</p><p>Climate change is causing a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme temperatures, and 2024 is expected to be the hottest year ever recorded. Around the world, people have been displaced by floods, hurricanes, droughts and other unnatural disasters, all made worse by global warming. Worldwide, Indigenous Peoples and land-dependent communities continue to bear the heaviest burden of biodiversity loss.</p><p>Lives have been lost; livelihoods, languages, and entire cultures are in peril; and disease, hunger and displacement is causing extreme suffering. The cost of these losses amounts to trillions of dollars in damages, which dwarf the cost of current investments in renewable energy, and threaten governments' capacity to fund policies to protect human rights.</p><p>12. What is Amnesty calling for at COP29?</p><p>Human rights must be at the heart of all climate action decision-making; States in a position to do so must massively scale up climate finance and funding for loss and damage; All states must commit to fully phasing out fossil fuels, in a way that is fast and fair; COP29 participants must not chase risky technologies, like carbon capture and storage and removals, or push gas as a transition fuel, as a means of distracting from the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels; The UNFCCC Secretariat, the government of Azerbaijan, and other governments must protect civic space, and guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.

We spoke to advocates from several countries in the Americas who, despite the terrifying challenges they face, continue to fight for a healthy environment for all. States must publicly recognize the value of their work and take urgent steps to ensure their safety and end the impunity that their attackers enjoy, said Graciela Mart\\xEDnez, campaigner for human rights defenders in the Americas at Amnesty International.</p><p>Amnesty International interviewed several defenders living in areas rich in natural resources like fossil fuels, natural carbon sinks or key minerals for the energy transition. Extraction of these resources is contributing to the climate crisis and often violating the rights of local populations. Most of these populations are Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants or farming or fishing communities. Many are headed by or consist of girls, young people and women. All six cases featured in the Amnesty International report are collective struggles.</p><p>A number of people, groups and organizations have mobilized against large economic interests to wean states off their dependence on energy from fossil fuels. In Ecuador, a group of girls and young people have taken legal action and campaigned against burning off waste natural gas from oil extraction (a practice known as flaring), which increases CO2 emissions and significantly harms the health of local populations. In Canada, the Wet'suwet'en people oppose the construction of a gas pipeline in their ancestral lands without their free, prior and informed consent.</p><p>Climate change is affecting how our food grows and destroying all our salmon, destroying the forage of elk and deer. Everyone will lose out if we stay quiet and comfortable in our homes, if we carry on as usual.... It's time for people to join together and force our government and industry to listen, said Freda Huson, Unist'ot'en chief of the Wet'suwet'en community.</p><p>Other people, groups and advocacy organizations are fighting to preserve carbon sinks and biodiversity. In Brazil, Afro-descendant women are offering a sustainable way to preserve the Amazon Forest based on the region's traditional crops, like Babassu palm. In Colombia, a fishers association has monitored and denounced pollution and destruction in the waters they depend on for their low-impact subsistence.</p><p>Our on-the-ground resistance is a form of environmental protection. No one knows the area better than us because we form part of this place, said Yuly Vel\\xE1squez, president of FEDEPESAN, the fishers association that defends the wetlands of the Magdalena Medio region in Colombia.</p><p>In Quebec, Canada, the Pessamit Innu Band has been studying the impact of climate change on their ancestral territory for two decades and has proposed ways to adapt and preserve their lands: We have been suffering the consequences of climate change for years, and we continue suffering them today. We needed to be ready. Worse things are coming, and we have to take care of the environment, said Ad\\xE9lard Benjamin of the Pessamit Innu Council.</p><p>Advocates in the region are also exposing how the transition to a low-carbon economy is being made at the expense of local communities that are already suffering injustice, inequality and discrimination. For example, the Indigenous peoples of northern Argentina are taking action and claiming their right to consultation and free, prior and informed consent, as well as to their livelihoods, in response to lithium mining on their ancestral lands.</p><p>Amnesty International urges all parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to recognize the legitimate work of people, groups and organizations that defend the environment or contribute to climate justice. It calls on them to ensure a safe environment that provides favourable conditions for defenders' local and international efforts and for their meaningful engagement on environmental and climate issues. Given their experience and knowledge, it is essential that they participate meaningfully in decisions related to the environment and climate justice without discrimination. These spaces and forms of participation must be adapted to the unique characteristics of girls, youth and women, Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, other racialized people and groups, and farming and rural communities, among others. In the case of Indigenous peoples, it is critical to respect their right to consultation and free, prior and informed consent regarding any action related to the environment and climate change on their lands.</p><p>As they make decisions at COP28, world leaders must heed the warnings of those who have struggled for generations to protect life on our planet. In a year that has seen the highest temperatures in history, with devastating consequences for humanity, states must listen to their demands and support their initiatives, said Graciela Mart\\xEDnez .</p><p>It's now more urgent than ever that they act decisively to reduce emissions, phase out fossil fuel production and keep the average global temperature increase below 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Our survival depends on it.</p><p>On numerous occasions, Amnesty International has documented how environmental defenders often face hostile and dangerous circumstances, especially when their demands run counter to major economic and political interests.</p><p>In a study published in September, the organization concluded that the criminalization of protests in Mexico is part of a broad strategy of disincentivizing and dismantling the defence of land, territory and the environment. Amnesty International also concluded in a study published this month that the Colombian state has responded inadequately to the serious risks that environmental defenders face and urged the Colombian authorities to take collective protection measures to address the structural causes of these risks.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69R0-P1F1-JB5P-J0YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 27, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZBZ</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp;

India subscribes to its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), submitted in 2022, as per the Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As per India's 4th Biennial Update Report (BUR-4) submitted to the UNFCCC on 30th December, 2024, between 2005 and 2020, India's emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reduced by 36% as against the NDC target of 45% to be achieved by 2030. Regarding status on achievement of target under NDC related to the share of non-fossil fuel-based sources, the share in India's total installed electricity generation capacity is 47.10% in December 2024 as against the target of 50% to be achieved by 2030. As compared to the base year of 2005, India has reached 2.29 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink as against the target of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes by 2030 through additional forest and tree cover.</p><p>The Government of India amended the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 (52 of 2001) in the year 2022 to facilitate the development of carbon market in the country. Subsequently under the act, the Government has notified the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) vide notification S.O. 2825(E), dated 28th June 2023 and amendment notification S.O. 5369(E), dated 19th December 2023.</p><p>The CCTS provides for two mechanisms namely, compliance mechanism and offset mechanism. In the compliance mechanism, the obligated entities are required to comply with the prescribed GHG emission intensity reduction norms in each compliance cycle of CCTS. The obligated entities which reduce their GHG emission intensity below the prescribed GHG emission intensity are eligible for issuance of Carbon Credit Certificates. ln the offset mechanism, the non-obligated entities can register their projects for GHG emission reduction or removal or avoidance for issuance of Carbon Credit Certificates.</p><p>The Government of India has also developed a plan to smoothly shift energy-intensive sectors and Designated Consumers (DCs) from the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme to the compliance mechanism under the CCTS. This plan ensures continuity, consistency, and alignment with national climate goals while avoiding duplication of targets. To initiate the transition, the Government has identified nine energy-intensive sectors for inclusion under compliance mechanism of the CCTS, namely, Aluminium, Cement, Steel, Paper, Chlor-Alkali, Fertiliser, Refinery, Petrochemical, and Textile. Under the offset mechanism, ten sectors have been approved, which include energy, industries, waste handling &amp; disposal, agriculture, forestry, transport, construction, fugitive emissions, solvent use and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage.</p><p>The Government has also notified the National Designated Authority for the Implementation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (NDAIAPA), vide Gazette Notification, dated 30th May, 2022. The Authority has updated and finalized the list of 14 activities under Green House Gas (GHG) mitigation activities, alternate materials, and removal activities, which are eligible for trading of international carbon credits under bilateral/ cooperative approaches, under Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The Government collaborates with other countries in the field of Renewable Energy sector and mitigating the environment degradation through mechanisms such as Memorandums of Understanding, Letters of Intent, Joint Declarations of Intent, Energy Dialogues and Partnerships.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), at its Sixth Session held in Nairobi, Kenya, on 1st March, 2024, unanimously adopted the resolution on sustainable lifestyles. The resolution based on the precepts of Mission LiFE was moved by India and co- sponsored by Sri Lanka and Bolivia and is a significant step forward in the globalisation of the concept of Mission LiFE or Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE).</p><p>India hosted the 3rd Voice of Global South Summit on 17th August, 2024 with the overarching theme \"An Empowered Global South for a Sustainable Future. In the Environment Ministers' Session, 18 countries and 1 bank from Global South participated. India emphasized the importance of encouraging sustainable consumption and production patterns, promoting sustainable lifestyles, reducing waste, and fostering a culture of conservation and respect for natural resources. The deliberations highlighted the call for climate justice and developing countries' demand for climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building.</p><p>Presently, India has cross border interconnections with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. An Agreement between India and Bhutan concerning Cooperation in the field of Hydroelectric Power was signed on 28th July, 2006. India and Nepal signed an agreement on 04.01.2024 which will facilitate export of 10,000 MW of electricity from Nepal to India in the next 10 years.</p><p>This information was provided by UNION MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE, SHRI KIRTI VARDHAN SINGH, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F2D-5G53-RSM2-V469-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 6, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

The Fund aims to help countries access resources to help aid their recovery from climate-related disasters, such as droughts, cyclones, and floods.</p><p>The increasing intensity of droughts and floods, as well as rising sea-levels, has led to massive human rights violations on the continent. Despite this, African leaders failed to anchor the Nairobi Declaration firmly on human rights principles to both address and protect human rights as the climate changes, said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International's Regional Director for West and Central Africa.</p><p>Some of the proposals in the Nairobi Declaration, such as those addressing carbon markets, have in the past resulted in negative outcomes for vulnerable communities. Carbon markets have led to serious human rights violations, including cases of forced evictions in Africa, when communities have been displaced to make space for carbon offsetting projects, such as reforestation or afforestation initiatives on their lands.</p><p>Amnesty International calls on African leaders attending COP28 in Dubai to ensure that the Loss and Damage Fund focuses on protecting human rights. By prioritizing carbon trading, leaders have shifted the burden of reducing CO2 emissions to African countries, even though developed countries hold most responsibility for the climate crisis, said Tigere Chagutah.</p><p>African leaders at the gathering must also advocate for grants, rather than loans, to help reduce the debt burden on the continent and make it easier for countries to respond to the climate crisis.</p><p>The proposal for a global tax on carbon pollution lacks clarity regarding how it will operate in practice. This lack of clarity could potentially harm ordinary people by creating additional challenges for the most vulnerable groups in Africa. Such a tax could disproportionately impact many economically disadvantaged communities by increasing the cost of basic necessities like energy and food.</p><p>''At COP28, African leaders must demand that developed countries not only meet their existing commitments, including previous shortfalls, but also substantially increase their climate finance contributions. They must promote just energy transition frameworks and demand environmentally sound technologies that prioritize the rights of rural communities as well as the urban poor, said Tigere Chagutah.</p><p>Background</p><p>From 4-6 September 2023, African leaders met in Nairobi, Kenya for the inaugural Africa Climate Summit. Attendees at the summit drafted the Nairobi Declaration, the continent's unified voice ahead of COP28.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S2-T3G1-JB5P-J05D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 1, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

More than 12,600 civilians killed, with many more injured. Entire communities reduced to rubble. Hospitals and schools destroyed. We must spare no effort to bring an end to this conflict, and to achieve a just and lasting peace in line with the UN Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conflicts like the war in Ukraine exact a heavy toll. A toll on people. A toll on fundamental principles like territorial integrity, sovereignty and the rule of law. And a toll on the vital business of this Council.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Without respect for human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social - sustainable peace is a pipedream. And like this Council, human rights shine a light in the darkest places.</p><p>Through your work, and the work of the High Commissioner's Office around the world, you're supporting brave human rights defenders risking persecution, detention and even death. You're working with Governments, civil society and others to strengthen action on human rights. And you're supporting investigations and accountability.</p><p>Five years ago, we launched our Call to Action for Human Rights, embedding human rights across the work of the United Nations around the world in close cooperation with our partners. I will continue supporting this important work, and the High Commissioner's Office, as we fight for human rights everywhere. We have our work cut out for us.</p><p>Human rights are the oxygen of humanity. But, one by one, human rights are being suffocated. By autocrats, crushing opposition because they fear what a truly empowered people would do. By a patriarchy that keeps girls out of school, and women at arm's length from basic rights. By wars and violence that strip populations of their right to food, water and education. By warmongers who thumb their nose at international law, international humanitarian law and the UN Charter.</p><p>Human rights are being suffocated by the climate crisis. And by a morally bankrupt global financial system that too often obstructs the path to greater equality and sustainable development. By runaway technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) that hold great promise, but also the ability to violate human rights at the touch of a button. By growing intolerance against entire groups - from Indigenous Peoples, to migrants and refugees, to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and other identities (LGBTQI+) community, to persons with disabilities. And by voices of division and anger who view human rights not as a boon to humanity, but as a barrier to the power, profit and control they seek.</p><p>In short - human rights are on the ropes and being pummelled hard. This represents a direct threat to all of the hard-won mechanisms and systems established over the last 80 years to protect and advance human rights.</p><p>But, as the recently adopted Pact for the Future reminds us, human rights are, in fact, a source of solutions. The Pact provides a playbook on how we can win the fight for human rights on several fronts.</p><p>First - human rights through peace and peace through human rights. Conflicts inflict human rights violations on a massive scale. In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, violations of human rights have skyrocketed since the horrific Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 and the intolerable levels of death and destruction in Gaza.</p><p>And I am gravely concerned by the rising violence in the occupied West Bank by Israeli settlers and other violations, as well as calls for annexation. We are witnessing a precarious ceasefire. We must avoid at all costs a resumption of hostilities. The people in Gaza have already suffered too much.</p><p>It's time for a permanent ceasefire, the dignified release of all remaining hostages, irreversible progress towards a two-State solution, an end to the occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with Gaza as an integral part.</p><p>In Sudan, bloodshed, displacement and famine are engulfing the country. The warring parties must take immediate action to protect civilians, uphold human rights, cease hostilities and forge peace. And domestic and international human rights monitoring and investigation mechanisms should be permitted to document what is happening on the ground.</p><p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we see a deadly whirlwind of violence and horrifying human rights abuses, amplified by the recent M23 [23 March Movement] offensive, supported by the Rwandan Defence Forces. As more cities fall, the risk of a regional war rises.</p><p>It's time to silence the guns. It's time for diplomacy and dialogue. The recent joint summit in the United Republic of Tanzania offered a way forward with a renewed call for an immediate ceasefire. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be respected. The Congolese people deserve peace.</p><p>In the Sahel, I call for a renewed regional dialogue to protect citizens from terrorism and systemic violations of human rights, and to create the conditions for sustainable development.</p><p>In Myanmar, the situation has grown far worse in the four years since the military seized power and arbitrarily detained members of the democratically elected Government. We need greater cooperation to bring an end to the hostilities and forge a path towards an inclusive democratic transition and a return to civilian rule, allowing for the safe return of the Rohingya refugees.</p><p>And in Haiti, we are seeing massive human rights violations - including more than a million people displaced, and children facing a horrific increase in sexual violence and recruitment into gangs. In the coming days, I will put forward proposals to the United Nations Security Council for greater stability and security for the people of Haiti - namely through an effective UN assistance mechanism to support the Multilateral Security Support mission, the national police and Haitian authorities. A durable solution requires a political process - led and owned by the Haitian people - that restores democratic institutions through elections.</p><p>The Pact for the Future calls for peace processes and approaches rooted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international law and the UN Charter. It proposes specific actions to prioritize conflict prevention, mediation, resolution and peacebuilding. And it includes a commitment to tackle the root causes of conflict, which are so often enmeshed in denials of basic human needs and rights.</p><p>Second - the Pact for the Future advances human rights through development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and human rights are fundamentally intertwined. They represent real human needs - health, food, water, education, decent work and social protection.</p><p>With less than one fifth of the Goals on track, the Pact calls for a massive acceleration through an SDG Stimulus, reforming the global financial architecture, and taking meaningful action for countries drowning in debt. This must include focused action to conquer the most widespread human rights abuse in history - inequality for women and girls.</p><p>The Pact calls for investing in battling all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and ensuring their meaningful participation and leadership across all walks of life. And along with the Declaration on Future Generations, the Pact calls for supporting the rights and futures of young people through decent work, removing barriers for youth participation, and enhancing training. And the Global Digital Compact calls on nations to champion young innovators, nurture entrepreneurial spirit and equip the next generation with digital literacy and skills.</p><p>Third - the Pact for the Future recognizes that the rule of law and human rights go hand-in-hand. The rule of law, when founded on human rights, is an essential pillar of protection. It shields the most vulnerable. It's the first line of defence against crime and corruption. It supports fair, just and inclusive economies and societies. It holds perpetrators of human rights atrocities to account. It enables civic space for people to make their voices heard - and for journalists to carry out their essential work, free from interference or threats. And it reaffirms the world's commitment to equal access to justice, good governance and transparent and accountable institutions.</p><p>Fourth - human rights through climate action. Last year was the hottest on record - capping the hottest decade on record. Rising heat, melting glaciers and hotter oceans are a recipe for disaster. Floods, droughts, deadly storms, hunger, mass displacement - our war on nature is also a war on human rights. We must choose a different path.</p><p>I salute the many Member States who legally recognize the right to a healthy environment - and I call on all countries to do the same. Governments must keep their promise to produce new, economy-wide national climate action plans this year, well ahead of thirtieth UN Climate Change Conference in Brazil. Those plans must limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5\\xB0C - including by accelerating the global energy transition.</p><p>We also need a surge in finance for climate action in developing countries, to adapt to global heating, slash emissions and accelerate the renewables revolution, which represents a massive economic opportunity. We must stand up to the misleading campaign of many in the fossil fuel industry and its enablers who are aiding and abetting this madness, while also protecting and defending those on the front lines of climate justice.</p><p>And fifth - human rights through stronger, better governance of technology. As fast-moving technologies expand into every aspect of our lives, I am deeply concerned about human rights being undermined.</p><p>At its best, social media is a meeting ground for people to exchange ideas and spark respectful debate. But, it can also be an arena of fiery combat and blatant ignorance. A place where the poisons of misinformation, disinformation, racism, misogyny and hate speech are not only tolerated - but often encouraged. Verbal violence online can easily spill into physical violence in real life.</p><p>Recent rollbacks on social media fact-checking and content moderation are reopening the floodgates to more hate, more threats and more violence. Make no mistake. These rollbacks will lead to less free speech, not more, as people become increasingly fearful to engage on these platforms. Meanwhile, the great promise of AI is matched by limitless peril to undermine human autonomy, human identity, human control - and yes, human rights.</p><p>In the face of these threats, the Global Digital Compact brings the world together to ensure that human rights are not sacrificed on the altar of technology. This includes working with digital companies and policymakers to extend human rights to every corner of cyberspace - including a new focus on information integrity across digital platforms.</p><p>The Global Principles for Information Integrity I launched last year will support and inform this work as we push for a more humane information ecosystem.</p><p>The Global Digital Compact also includes the first universal agreement on the governance of AI that brings every country to the table and commitments on capacity-building, so all countries and people benefit from AI's potential. By investing in affordable Internet, digital literacy and infrastructure. By helping developing countries use AI to grow small businesses, improve public services and connect communities to new markets. And by placing human rights at the centre of AI-driven systems.</p><p>The Pact's decisions to create an Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and an ongoing Global Dialogue that ensure all countries have a voice in shaping its future are important steps forward. We must implement them.</p><p>We can help end the suffocation of human rights by breathing life into the Pact for the Future and the work of this Council. Let's do that together. We don't have a moment to lose.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FF9-0BM3-RRVV-543H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 31, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DET3</classCode><className>2014 UKRAINIAN PROTESTS &amp;

Despite contributing 0.02% of the greenhouse gas emissions driving global temperature increases, they are among the most vulnerable nations in the world to the climate crisis.</p><p>Landmark climate case</p><p>And it was these feelings of injustice and urgency that drove Houniuhi, who is president of the campaign group Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, and many other young people to spearhead calls to bring the issue straight to the world's top court.</p><p>What started as a classroom discussion five years ago on the Pacific Island of Vanuatu, has in the last two weeks brought representatives from over 100 nations and international organizations to deliver testimonies at the largest ever case before the UN court.</p><p>In 2023, the UN, led by Vanuatu, specifically requested the international court adjudicate on climate responsibility, having expressed \"profound alarm\" that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise despite vows to cut them drastically.</p><p>The court has been asked to provide an advisory opinion on the duties states have under international law to protect the climate. They've also been asked to address what the legal consequences are for those who \"by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system.\"</p><p>The court has witnessed powerful testimonies of how rising temperatures, largely driven by greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels, are devastating lives on the frontline of the crisis.</p><p>But we are not looking for sympathy, explained Houniuhi. \"We're looking for fairness, fairness in the laws that are supposed to govern us.\"</p><p>Nearly every country has ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement - a legally binding treaty aiming to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Still, emissions are at record highs. Under current policies, the world is on track for over 3C warming, with catastrophic climate consequences.</p><p>Big emitters highlight Paris Agreement</p><p>Countries speaking at the hearings included some of the world's largest current and historical emitters of greenhouse gases such as the US, China, and Russia.</p><p>\"These states have not only enabled but proactively encouraged the production and consumption of fossil fuels and continue to do so today,\" said Houniuhi.</p><p>The hearings come on the heels of what was seen by many climate vulnerable countries as a betrayal at the annual UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. Wealthy, industrialized nations agreed at the summit to provide at least $300 billion for low-income countries to fight climate change - far below the sum of at least $1 trillion per year they argued was necessary.</p><p>One of the most striking aspects of the case is the divide that has emerged between big polluters and the rest of the world, said Nikki Reisch, climate and energy program director at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).</p><p>\"Fossil fuel giants and major polluters found themselves isolated in their attempts to sweep their historical responsibility for the climate crisis under the rug and claim that their legal obligations start and end with the Paris Agreement,\" said Reisch.</p><p>CIEL said the current UN climate regime, which includes the Paris Agreement, is the only relevant existing international law on states' climate obligations and it requires them to do very little. It urged the top court to look beyond Paris to the \"wider universe of international law\" encompassing environmental and human rights law.</p><p>Polluters should face accountability</p><p>But speaking at The Hague, Margaret L. Taylor, legal adviser at the US State Department, said the US wanted the court to judge in a way that \"preserves and promotes the centrality\" of existing treaties, primarily the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Taylor said the court should not weigh whether countries have \"violated obligations\" in the past regarding climate policy. \"Nor would it be appropriate,\" she said, for the court to decide whether states have a \"responsibility for reparations.\" The US has contributed most to global CO2 emissions since humans started burning fossil fuels.</p><p>China, the current biggest emitter, as well as fossil fuel powerhouse Australia, also insisted UN climate negotiations should remain the \"primary channel\" to govern action.</p><p>Several countries including Vanuatu, Fiji and Costa Rica argued for climate reparations proportionate to climate harms.</p><p>Julian Aguon, an indigenous human rights lawyer involved in the proceedings, said it has been deeply heartening to see the vast majority of participants agree that the conduct that's causing climate change is unlawful, must stop immediately, and that those responsible must remedy any harm caused.</p><p>\"This shared legal and moral clarity could not arrive at a more perfect time. Indeed, if the past two weeks could be summed up in three words, it might be, 'behold the many',\" said Aguon.</p><p>What impact could a top court decision have?</p><p>After hearings at The Hague ended Friday, a court decision is expected early next year.</p><p>While its opinion is not binding, it is expected to have wide repercussions in clarifying states' obligations under international law, as national courts often look to the top court for guidance.</p><p>\"The ICJ's opinion could shape the trajectory of global climate litigation, paving the way for a new era of decisive action to tackle the global climate crisis,\" said Joy Reyes, climate justice lawyer and policy officer at the London School of Economics' Grantham Institute. \"As the world's highest court, the world court's proceedings carry significant authority and moral weight.\"</p><p>Even before a decision is reached, campaigner Houniuhi called the proceedings a milestone in climate justice as the first time the voices of frontline communities will be weighed equally alongside those of major polluters.</p><p>Now the judges have the power to course correct on climate change, she said. \"And it's not too late.\"</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNH-YGV1-JB5P-J295-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 17, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Tribunals</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

It has faced a number of hurdles throughout its development but finally, the funds could start being disbursed to those who need them most as soon as next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finance is one of the key focuses for COP29 in Baku this November and the future of this vital climate justice tool could hang on these negotiations.</p><p>How to deliver the money to climate-vulnerable nations</p><p>Dubbed the 'finance COP', countries are set to work out the finer details of the loss and damage fund in Baku next month.</p><p>But, in the interim between the two climate COPs, lots of procedural points have been ironed out and progress has finally been made toward getting this money to countries in need.</p><p>A board has been nominated to oversee the fund, the World Bank was (controversially) chosen as its institutional home and the Philippines was selected as its host country.</p><p>The board officially hired Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, a Senegalese and American national who has worked at public and private banks, as the fund's executive director at a pre-COP meeting in late September.</p><p>At this meeting in Azerbaijan, the fund's board also completed crucial groundwork that will hopefully see funding disbursed for the first time in 2025.</p><p>This breakthrough in Baku marks a crucial step in enabling action on climate change, COP29 president-designate Mukhtar Babayev said in a statement.</p><p>This is a truly historic day, years in the making, that has required determination from so many and an unwavering focus on the needs of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis.</p><p>The COP29 presidency added that it hopes to use this year's climate conference to work with the countries which have already pledged money to convert those pledges into tangible funding for communities that urgently need it.</p><p>A 30-year fight for loss and damage funds</p><p>The fight for an operational loss and damage fund has been a long one. Small island nations, African countries and climate justice activists have been among its strongest advocates over the last three decades.</p><p>Less-developed nations have led the call for assistance for countries that have experienced catastrophic losses due to climate change. Wealthier nations have long been concerned that this constitutes a kind of 'compensation' or 'reparations' for the impact of their historic greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Groundwork was laid during COP27 in Egypt in 2022 where an agreement was made to create a fund to help low-income developing countries offset the damage from natural disasters caused by climate change.</p><p>Climate-vulnerable countries then celebrated a win as COP28 in Dubai last year began with a historic decision on actually establishing said fund.</p><p>In total, it received more than $700 million (634 million) in pledges for contributions by the end of the climate conference and was hailed as a significant commitment to climate justice.</p><p>Loss and damage funds fall far short of what is needed</p><p>Advocates for the fund had hoped that more commitments from wealthy nations would come in 12 months before the next climate COP.</p><p>But since then, the pot of money has only risen to around $800 million (720 million). Momentum seems to have stalled with wealthy nations staying silent about further contributions to the fund which fall far short of what experts say is needed.</p><p>The 14 developing countries on the fund's board have argued that it needs $100 billion (91 billion) more each year by 2030 but even that could be lower than the required amount. Some estimates put the annual loss and damage from climate change in developing countries at around $400 billion (362 billion) a year by 2030 with expectations that this number could grow.</p><p>This is a drop in the ocean, compared to the trillions needed to address the escalating costs of the negative impacts of climate change, Bahamas Prime Minister Phillip Davis told the UN General Assembly in September.</p><p>This is not just an issue of funding. It is fundamentally an issue of sustainability and survival. Without it, peace and security mean nothing.</p><p>Davis called for the loss and damage fund to be fully operationalised, adding that it was about responsibility, accountability, and building a future where those who have polluted the most, contribute the most to cleaning up the mess.</p><p>He said that developed nations must step up with concrete commitments that reflect the scale of the crisis.</p><p>The COP29 Presidency has said one of its goals for this year's gathering in Baku to call for further contributions.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D4K-W6P1-DXMS-821W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 8, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Let me begin by thanking the Group of 77 plus China for your strong voice on climate action. Your unity, advocacy and tenacity were essential in securing last year's historic loss and damage agreement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the challenges keep growing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of you face crushing debt burdens, fuelled by sky-high borrowing costs, that hamper efforts to reduce emissions and protect people from increasingly deadly storms, floods and droughts. This creates a paradox.</p><p>For example, Africa is home to 60 per cent of the world's best solar resources. But Africa only received 2 per cent of global renewable energy investments in the last two decades.</p><p>African countries need both the financial and the technical support to unleash the renewables revolution. And the same is true in several other regions.</p><p>The Global Stocktake must create the conditions for a surge of global climate ambition in 2025 and beyond. That requires action in three areas.</p><p>First, finance.</p><p>Developed countries must clarify the delivery of the $100 billion commitment.</p><p>We need also to see a clear plan to double adaptation finance to $40 billion a year by 2025 as a first step to devoting at least half of all climate finance to adaptation.</p><p>And we need to see much greater support for the new loss and damage fund. It started well but with not much money.</p><p>If you will permit me, I want to pay tribute to Professor Saleemul Huq of Bangladesh, who passed away recently, as he was a member of my Scientific Advisory Board and a luminary in the fight for climate justice and especially in support for loss and damage.</p><p>Climate finance still has a long way to go. Up to 18 times more finance is needed for adaptation to meet the current needs of developing countries. And the International Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that the transition to net zero in emerging markets and developing economies will cost more than $2 trillion annually by 2030.</p><p>The outdated international financial architecture must be reformed to reflect the realities of today and to respond to developing countries' needs including in relation to the Bretton Woods system.</p><p>The international financial system must provide an effective debt-relief mechanism, that supports payment suspensions, longer lending terms and lower rates.</p><p>The experience of Zambia demonstrates how fragile it was the mechanism put in place by the Group of 20 (G20). We need an effective debt relief mechanism and we need it now.</p><p>All international financial institutions must align their policies, plans and programmes with the Paris Agreement.</p><p>And we need to see an increase in the capital base of the multilateral development banks; and reform of their business models so that they leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.</p><p>Grants and concessional finance are essential for leveraging private finance at scale. Yet, just under 30 per cent of developed countries' public climate finance is in the form of grants.</p><p>That proportion must rise significantly - and the COP28 outcome should say clearly so.</p><p>Second, emissions must be drastically reduced.</p><p>Current policies would take us towards a 3\\xB0C rise in global temperature. That spells disaster, particularly for developing countries.</p><p>The 1.5\\xB0C limit is still possible but it is on the precipice.</p><p>The Global Stocktake must set a clear expectation that countries' 2025 nationally determined contributions will align with the 1.5\\xB0C limit.</p><p>And it must set a clear global science-based pathway to get there.</p><p>We need a just, fair and equitable transition from fossil fuels to renewables.</p><p>COP28 must commit countries to triple renewables capacity, double energy efficiency and bring clean energy to all, by 2030. And phase out fossil fuels with a road map that is equitable and with a timeframe compatible with 1.5\\xB0C is also essential.</p><p>The very existence of some countries in this room depends on it.</p><p>Finally, this COP must strengthen international cooperation on climate.</p><p>We need collaboration between Governments, and between countries and companies: to align all critical emitting sectors with 1.5\\xB0C; to put a fair price on carbon; to protect everyone on Earth with an effective early warning system; and to support the global transition to net zero by 2050.</p><p>I have proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact, in which big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions.</p><p>And developed countries mobilize financial and technical resources to support emerging economies to do so.</p><p>My Acceleration Agenda supercharges those efforts in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.</p><p>That is why, I ask countries to hit fast forward on their net zero timelines so that they get there as soon as possible to 2040 in developed countries and 2050 in emerging economies.</p><p>To achieve net zero, we also need to deploy clean energy technologies at pace and scale.</p><p>The extraction of critical minerals for the clean energy revolution - from wind farms to solar panels and battery manufacturing - must be done in a sustainable, fair and just way.</p><p>Demand for these minerals is set to increase almost fourfold by 2030.</p><p>At my Climate Ambition Summit, I heard repeated calls from Group of 77 and China leaders for their countries and communities holding these minerals to fully benefit with maximum local added value.</p><p>We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past with a systematic exploitation of developing countries reduced to the production of basic raw materials.</p><p>Today I'm pleased to announce I am establishing the Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals.</p><p>The Panel will bring together Governments, international organizations, industry and civil society to develop common and voluntary principles to guide extractive industries in the years ahead in the name of justice and sustainability.</p><p>The final fight to keep 1.5\\xB0C alive is on. And we are battling for climate justice. These are fights we can win.</p><p>This COP can win with a double objective: maximum ambition on mitigation and maximum ambition in relation to climate justice, namely taking into full account the interests of developing countries.</p><p>What we must avoid at all costs is a compromise based on minimum ambition on mitigation and minimum ambition on climate justice.</p><p>Because developing countries would be losing twice, would be losing because there is no climate justice and be losing because without effective mitigation the dramatic impacts of climate change will be [suffered] essentially by vulnerable populations in the global South.</p><p>And so, I count on the Group of 77 and China to keep pushing for the change our world needs. To make this COP a game changer with maximum ambition to reduce emissions and maximum ambition on climate justice to the benefit of developing countries and their populations.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69T4-CFS1-DXMS-80D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 6, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002151</classCode><className>EXTERNAL DEBT REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

He said, What we decide here, will enable all of us, particularly those in the Global South, to not only take ambitious mitigation action but also adapt to Climate Change. This CoP is historic in this context.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister reiterated that the decisions on this forum should be guided by the core principles of Equity, Climate Justice and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities provided in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. The context of different national circumstances, sustainable development goals and poverty eradication, particularly in respect of the Global South should not be lost sight of, he added.</p><p>India's statement noted that the high Carbon Emission Development Pathways of the Global North in past have left very little carbon space for the Global South. However, it read, the growth trajectories for fulfilling the primary needs of sustainable development and poverty eradication cannot be compromised. The Minister asserted, Despite not contributing to the problem, we in the Global South are bearing huge financial burden on account of climate actions for mitigation on the one hand, and losses and damages caused by climate change on the other, thus severely limiting our capacity to meet our developmental needs. But these have not dampened India's resolve and commitment to take ambitious climate actions.</p><p>Informing the gathering about India's initiatives towards combating Climate Change, Shri Singh said that the country has achieved the 2015 NDC targets on emission intensity reduction and non fossil based installed electricity generation capacity much earlier than 2030 and have further enhanced its ambition. The Minister talked about how India's Renewable Energy Capacity has nearly tripled from its 2014 levels and the country is on the course to achieve the 500 GW target by 2030. Further, he said, India has launched the Mission LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment to encourage the sustainable lifestyle practices at the global level. Mission LiFE inspires individuals, communities and societies to exercise choices and behaviours that focus on mindful utilisation of resources.</p><p>Talking about how India is at the forefront of pro-planet actions, Shri Singh stated, The campaign - 'Ek Ped Maa ke Naam' - was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, on World Environment Day 2024, wherein one billion saplings have been planted already. 'Plant4Mother', which exhorts everyone to plant a tree as a mark of love, respect and honour of our mother and Mother Earth has resonated across the spectrum because of its powerful, inspirational and emotional connect, the Minister added.</p><p>Furthermore, the Indian statement informed about its initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure (CDRI), Global Biofuel Alliance, Leadership Group on Industry Transition and Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy Industry Coalition that have been launched with different partner countries, in pursuance of global climate actions.</p><p>India called out some of the developed countries that have resorted to unilateral measures making climate actions more difficult for the Global South. Raising of climate ambitions to align with Paris Temperature Goals has to be preceded by free availability of green technologies, producing them on scale and availability of finance for their deployment, particularly in the Global South. The statement read, The emergent situation we are in, there is no option but to break all barriers to flow of technology, finances and capacity to the Global South. The theme of this CoP - 'enabling actions and enhanced ambition' is very relevant in this context. CoP29 is the CoP for Climate Finance - the New Collective Quantified Goals (NCQG) on Climate Finance for mobilizing climate finance for meeting the needs and priorities of Developing countries.</p><p>In the statement, Shri Singh called for the need to appreciate that huge costs are being imposed on a Developing country like India, for undertaking the climate actions. He said, What we decide here on NCQG must be founded on the principle of Climate Justice. The decisions must be ambitious and unambiguous, taking into consideration the evolving needs and priorities of the Developing countries, and their commitment to sustainable development and eradication of poverty.</p><p>Reminding the gathering that the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are due for submission the next year, India stated that the breach of carbon space seems imminent towards the end of this critical decade. The statement said, It is imperative, therefore, that the Developed countries show leadership in mitigation actions, as required under Paris Agreement, by not just advancing their net zero targets but providing enough carbon space for Developing countries like ours to develop. What we decide here will determine the course of history. I urge that all of us should work with determination towards making the CoP 29, meaningful and impactful in its outcomes. Please be assured of India's full cooperation for a successful COP-29.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DG6-8TJ1-DXMS-805H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 22, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTc1MzRDMTNGQjY1NEJDMkIyQkQ1QzNEODA2NkM4MUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0ZCODMzRjdEREY3NDg3Mzk3MUU3QTJGNDFBNjlFMEU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Caused in large part by warming global temperatures connected to the burning of fossil fuels for energy production and transport.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Sea level rise is a huge problem for small island states with limited land for people to live on,\" Jule Schnakenberg, executive officer of World's Youth for Climate Justice, said, adding that it also limits people's access to fresh water to drink, grow food, and cook with.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Campaigners say it is human rights violations like these that motivated them to lobby governments into taking legal action. Those beginnings have culminated in a United Nations General Assembly decision to ask its highest court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), for a legal opinion on the obligations of states concerning climate change.</p><p>Led by the Pacific Island of Vanuatu, 98 countries from all over the world and 12 international organizations are poised to give oral statements to the ICJ over the next two weeks. Judges at the court will issue an advisory opinion on the issue - and the legal consequences for governments that either fail to act or have taken action that significantly harms the environment.</p><p>\"For several of us, this is a journey that has taken us five years and we recognize this milestone not as a goal, but rather as a checkpoint, a checkpoint because this is another step in the right direction in this fight for climate justice,\" said Siosiua Veikune, a campaigner with the Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change group.</p><p>Hiding behind the Paris Agreement</p><p>Whether drought, flooding or storms, the consequences of a hotter world are being felt all over the planet. But it is sea level rise that significantly impacts small island states like those in the Pacific. There, water levels are rising almost twice as fast as the global average, with increases of 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) in the western Pacific since 1993, according to the World Meteorological Organization.</p><p>UN assessments put current emissions-reduction targets promised by nations under the International Paris Agreement, on track for a global temperature rise of up to 2.9 degrees Celsius. That is well above the accord's stated limit of 2 degrees with efforts to keep warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).</p><p>\"There is such an unconscionable gap between where state policies need to be and where they are at and what justice and science demands is necessary [to be done] to avert climate catastrophe,\" Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), told DW.</p><p>Legal experts say the advisory opinion will clarify the obligations of states under already existing legislation and go beyond the scope of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"These big polluters are trying to hide behind Paris, essentially saying that is all there is,\" Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is representing Vanuatu in the ICJ climate hearings, told DW. She says the real question is whether the court will \"confirm that there's more than Paris and that these other obligations also apply in parallel.\"</p><p>The ICJ is one of three courts asked to issue an advisory opinion on the obligation of states concerning climate change.</p><p>In May, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea was the first to issue its advisory opinion recognizing greenhouse gases as a form of marine pollution. It highlighted the obligations of states under the law of the sea as additional to those within the Paris Accord.</p><p>Following hearings earlier this year, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights is expected to deliver its opinion on the obligations of states to protect human rights concerning climate change before the ICJ issues its opinion.</p><p>Besides taking into account the two previous advisory opinions, experts say the ICJ will also consider other significant climate judgements, like the European Court of Human Rights ruling that Switzerland had violated the human rights of its citizens by missing past emissions reduction targets.</p><p>\"We want to move towards kind of rights-based climate action so that people know they have a human right or many human rights, and that their states have to take all necessary measures [...]and do this on the basis of the best available science [...] and if states don't do that, you have a legal right to hold your government or companies accountable,\" said Schnakenberg.</p><p>A blueprint for climate litigation</p><p>Although advisory opinions from the ICJ are not legally binding, they do have political and legal significance.</p><p>In October, Ireland's government decided to unilaterally suspend trade with Israel on products originating from the occupied West Bank following an ICJ advisory opinion over the violation of Palestinian people's rights.</p><p>Legal experts say the ICJ advisory opinion on climate change could have similar political ramifications - particularly as countries prepare to submit new greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the run-up to the next United Nations climate summit in November 2025.</p><p>\"That would probably be the ideal outcome, that the court just provides the course correction that is needed for the negotiations themselves, so then the ambition is increased,\" said Wewerinke-Singh.</p><p>If that is not the outcome, Chowdhury said the opinion could provide a \"legal blueprint\" for the international law that applies to climate change for potential litigation through domestic and international courts.</p><p>Currently, there are more than 2,000 climate cases taking place globally against states and companies.</p><p>\"Of course, you're going to have to prove causality and it'll be dependent on a case-by-case basis, but what the court can do is lay out that the legal principle for remedy and reparations does exist under international law,\" added Chowdhury.</p><p>After years of fighting and finally making it to the ICJ hearings at the Hague, Schakenberg says she and the campaigners she is working with in the Pacific and around the world are hopeful.</p><p>\"Throughout this campaign, we've always said that we are stubborn optimists, and I think we just have to believe that change is possible,\" she said.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Participating Nations had to deliberate on the expectations on the UAE 'Just Transition Work' programme, and how can it serve as an effective tool for assisting Parties in further defining and implementing their climate plans in the context of just transition pathways that promote sustainable development and poverty eradication. The Parties were expected to engage on how can international cooperation and support on the full range of means of implementation assist them to advance their just transition pathways in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leading the intervention,Secretary (MoEFCC) &amp; Dy. Leader of Indian Delegation, Ms. Leena Nandan, thankedall Parties for their recognition of the importance of justice in climate action. She clarified that India's interpretation of 'Just Transitions' is far broader than the narrow framing of the questions. Ms. Nandan said. Global climate justice is at the core of our work here under the Convention and its Paris Agreement. The principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) are foundational to all work under the Convention and its Paris Agreement.</p><p>India's intervention reminded all Parties that it is high time that these principles are actually well understood by all in context of the global climate action. It stated, The principles have embedded within themselves the historical emissions and consequent responsibilities on parties and the aspirations of development for the developing countries. Development is the over-riding priority for countries of the global South. The fact of stark inequalities in access to energy, infrastructure, amenities, and well-being are not hidden from the world. Developing countries like India have per capita energy consumption at one third of the global average, not to compare with the average of the developed countries, which is much higher.</p><p>Clearly stating India's stance on 'Just Transitions', the intervention said, Our understanding and operationalisation of just transitions must foreground the fact of these vastly different starting points and national circumstance. At CoP27, it was decided that the issues of just transition are not very narrow, but are linked to wider economic and social aspects of the transition, among others. The denial of international equity narrows our domestic options and poses further challenges to our objectives of achieving immediate, rapid, and sustained access to development opportunities and affects the most vulnerable communities in our countries the most.</p><p>Therefore, the statement read, the global dimensions of just transitions must be recognised and reflected in the work being undertaken at COP29. In the spirit of international cooperation that is embedded in this multilateral process, our discussion here must include discussion of key enablers and disenablers of global just transitions, it added. India's intervention called all Parties to discuss the following:</p><p>- Unilateral coercive measures that restrict trade flows and restrict countries from accessing equitable development opportunities.</p><p>- Intellectual Property Rights on green technologies, which hinders their free and scalable access to developing countries.</p><p>- Carbon debt that is owed by Developed countries to Developing countries for their overuse of the global carbon budget. Monetization of this carbon debt would be in trillions.</p><p>- Science that guides all climate discourse - whether it is based on considerations of global equity and environmental justice?</p><p>- How the inequity continues to be perpetuated in the climate discourse.</p><p>- The choices of citizens in Developed countries being sacrosanct vs the costs imposed on the citizens of Developing countries due to transition.</p><p>- Promotion of sustainable lifestyles that we all agreed to at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi this year.</p><p>India reminded all the Parties that a frank discussion of these issues and their inclusion in the decisions taken at CoP29 will be the cornerstone of building trust that would unlock a truly equitable and just global transition.</p><p>Therefore, the statement read, We feel it is premature to discuss just transition pathways in context of NDCs and NAPs. Just transition has to begin with transition in Developed countries.We underscore the need forDeveloped countries to take lead in transitions to achieve net zero emissions by end of this decade not only to provide carbon space for Developing countries, but also to lower the costs of transition unduly put on citizen of Developing countries.</p><p>India asserted that provision of adequate means of implementation is the most critical enabler for just transitions. At the same time, transitions in Developing countries should not be seen as investment opportunities. They undermine the 'just' element of just transitions by making the victim pay up for remedies rather than providing him the remedy.</p><p>Mincing no words in saying that Just transitions must be Just, India's intervention noted that all Parties must work with the aim to strengthening the work programme implementation. At the same time CBDR-RC, equity and climate justice should be core for discussions of just transitions pathways and should not be seen as another platform to push for prescriptive top-down approaches in disregard to the nationally determined nature of transition pathways.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DG0-SS51-JB5P-J0JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 21, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;
