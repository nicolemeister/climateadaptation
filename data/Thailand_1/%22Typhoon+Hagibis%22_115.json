General Prayut Chan-o-cha (Ret.), Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, chaired the 22nd ASEAN-Japan Summit, during the 35th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits. The session was attended by H.E. Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan and Leaders of ASEAN Member States.</p><p>ASEAN Leaders congratulated Japan on the enthronement of His Majesty Emperor Naruhito and the new Reiwa era, as well as the successful hosting of the G20 Osaka Summit in June and the Rugby World Cup, early November 2019. They also expressed their sympathy in solidarity to the government of Japan and the victims of the tragic disaster from Typhoon Hagibis. The Prime Minister of Japan welcomed ASEAN athletes to the Olympics and Paralympics to be held in Tokyo next year.</p><p>The Meeting appreciated Japan's continued support for ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led mechanisms in the regional architecture, as well as Japan's contribution to the Initiative for ASEAN Integration. The Meeting discussed ways to strengthen the ASEAN-Japan Strategic Partnership, and advance sustainability in all dimensions. In this regard, the Meeting discussed complementarities between Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) Strategy and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), and cooperation with Japan in areas under the AOIP. The Meeting exchanged views on regional issues, such as the situation in the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>The Leaders noted the strong economic relations between ASEAN and Japan, and discussed their cooperation to promote trade, investment and connectivity. The Meeting discussed the synergy between Japan's Quality Infrastructure Initiative and the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) 2025. The Meeting supported the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and recognized the importance of developing a digital infrastructure as well as preparations for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).</p><p>On socio-cultural issues, they supported cooperation in education such as teacher and vocational training, and higher education scholarships. ASEAN Leaders and the Prime Minister of Japan adopted the Joint Statement of the 22nd ASEAN-Japan Summit on Connectivity.</p><p>ASEAN-Japan informal dialogue relations began in 1973, and four years later in 1977, Japan officially became ASEAN's Dialogue Partner. When ASEAN and Japan celebrated the 30th Anniversary of their Dialogue Relations in 2003, Japan was elevated to Strategic Partner. In 2011, Japan became the first Dialogue Partner to establish a Permanent Mission to ASEAN in Jakarta.</p><p>(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thailand)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFC-FYM1-DXMS-81XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Initiative &amp;

Mr Niyom said he was informed by the Japanese customs officials that the Thai man had hidden a small box of the cannabis oil extract in his luggage.</p><p> He said this had left him wondering how the traveller had managed to pass through security checks at Suvarnabhumi airport in Thailand without being detected.  hr class=\"dot-double Do you like the content of this article?   !-- article-news detail --       MOST RECENT  class=\"icon-arrow    World Flooded capital Four people were killed and 17 were missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades paralysed Tokyo.</p><p>  08:01     Business Only 'baby step' A partial US-China deal may only offer a temporary tariff reprieve because it lacks specifics and leaves the thorny issues for later, analysts said.  07:45     Thailand Typhoon delays The Immigration Bureau is taking steps to deal with congestion caused by flight delays at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>  07:11          section   MORE IN SECTION    !--  --!-- footer -- !-- /footer -- </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG13102019027784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X85-WM91-F00C-60MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 13, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Business &amp;

Prayut Chan-o-cha, presided over the opening ceremony of the 22nd ASEAN+3 Summit in Bangkok. The Government Spokeswoman, Prof. Dr. Narumon Pinyosinwat, provided a summary of the meeting as follows:</p><p>The 22nd ASEAN+3 Summit was attended by leaders of the 10 ASEAN member states as well as China, South Korea, and Japan. ASEAN+3 was formed to set a direction for cooperation and exchange views on pressing regional and international issues. The vision of Thailand's ASEAN Chairmanship, \"Advancing Partnership for Sustainability\", is the theme of this year's summit.</p><p>The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Thai government and people, welcomed the 22 ASEAN+3 delegates and extended condolences to the government and people of Japan, following extensive destruction caused by Typhoon Hagibis last month. Thailand wishes Japan a speedy recovery from the effects of the natural disaster.</p><p>Gen. Prayut said the ASEAN+3 cooperation framework is one of the most dynamic cooperation frameworks in ASEAN. ASEAN+3 is a main pillar for the promotion of cooperation in specific areas as well as the establishment of communities in ASEAN to promote the better quality of life of people in all 13 countries.</p><p>The ASEAN+3 cooperation is based on the principle of 3M, which comprises mutual trust, mutual benefit and mutual respect. Against the backdrop of current changes in trade, economy; and society as the results of the fourth industrial revolution, ASEAN+3 will face more challenges. He suggested that ASEAN+3 must be prepared and work together to create opportunities from such challenges.</p><p>Gen. Prayut also proposed two guidelines to promote the ASEAN+3 cooperation as follows:</p><p>Regional connection: Thailand realizes the significance of connection within ASEAN and Asia Pacific. Promoting the regional connection will enhance the potential of Asia Pacific to be an important mechanism for continuous global economic growth and sustainable development.</p><p>Sustainable in all dimensions: As ASEAN's coordinator in sustainable development, Thailand wants ASEAN+3 to support ASEAN's initiatives, particularly the establishment of the ASEAN Center for Sustainable Development Studies and Dialogue and the ASEAN Center for Active Ageing and Innovation in Thailand.</p><p>In the final part of the meeting, the Thai premier expressed his confidence that ASEAN+3 will be an important mechanism to create a partnership for a sustainable future in East Asia. Gen. Prayut then thanked the ASEAN member states, China, Japan, South Korea and the ASEAN Secretariat for supporting Thailand's ASEAN Chairmanship throughout this year.</p><p>(National News Bureau of Thailand)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF4-YJT1-DXMS-804P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC00022IJ</classCode><className>3M CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS339114 DENTAL EQUIPMENT &amp;

In Berlin alone, over 50,000 protesters are converging on the government district.</p><p>Three days before the start of the UN climate conference in Madrid, people have taken to the streets on Friday in 2,400 cities across 157 countries to protest government inaction on climate change.</p><p>The Fridays for Future movement said it thought some 100,000 climate strikers would participate in more than 500 demonstrations across Germany. Their demands include:</p><p>An end to fossil fuel subsidies; Switching off a quarter of all coal-fired power stations; Renewable sources to cover 100% of Germany's energy needs by 2035. German climate package under fire</p><p>Thousands of protesters gathered in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to voice dissatisfaction with a perceived lack of urgency on the part of the government. Some 50,000 people took part, demanding a \"new start\" for the government's climate policy. Young activists in Berlin also took a dip in the city's Spree River to demonstrate their desire for more action.</p><p>As protests got underway, Germany's upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, passed a raft of measures aimed at cutting emissions. The legislation imposes obligations on government departments, forces a rise in fossil fuel prices and reduces the price of rail tickets in an effort to reduce travel by air and car.</p><p>Clara Meyer, from the Fridays for Future movement, told DW the measures did not go far enough.</p><p>\"The problem is that it doesn't actually target or tackle the problem,\" Meyer said. \"We need a much higher CO2 tax. We see this climate change package as basically just an embarrassment.\"</p><p>Global protests open in Australia</p><p>Activists and schoolchildren in Australia opened the day of protests by picketing the headquarters of the ruling conservative Liberal Party. Protesters directed their opposition at Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has denied that there is any link between his government's climate change policies and bush fires sweeping large parts of the country.</p><p>In Japan, hundreds marched through Tokyo's Shinjuku district to show their support for the Fridays For Future movement.</p><p>The country has itself been hit by weather extremes in recent years, with increasingly frequent typhoons, and hotter weather. In October, Typhoon Hagibis ripped through central and north-eastern parts of the country, killing scores of people.</p><p>The protests took place as negotiators from some 200 countries prepared to meet for the COP25 climate conference in Madrid.

More than 100 people were also injured in its wake, according to public broadcaster NHK, as the numbers kept growing.</p><p>News footage showed a rescue helicopter hovering in a flooded area in Nagano prefecture where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke. The chopper plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.</p><p>A stretch of Fukushima, in the city of Date, was also flooded with only rooftops of residential homes visible in some areas. Parts of nearby Miyagi prefecture were also under water.</p><p>The Tama River, which runs by Tokyo, overflowed its banks.</p><p>Authorities warned of a risk of mudslides. Among the reported deaths were those whose homes were buried in landslides. Other fatalities included people who were swept away by raging rivers.</p><p>Power out for thousands</p><p>About 286,000 homes were without electricity. Several train service in the Tokyo area resumed early morning, although others were undergoing safety checks and were expected to restart later Sunday.</p><p>Ruling party politician Fumio Kishida said the government will do its utmost in rescue operations, including making sure that those who moved to shelters were taken care of.</p><p>He acknowledged Japan's power grids need to be strengthened so people in disaster areas can rely on timely information.</p><p>So many risks remain, and it is a reality we must stay on guard, Kishida said on an NHK TV news talk show. We must do our utmost. In these times, a disaster can hit anytime.</p><p>The World Rugby Cup match between Namibia and Canada, scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi, northern Japan, was canceled as a precautionary measure.</p><p>All other matches scheduled for Saturday had been canceled. Stores and amusement parks had been closed.</p><p>Infrastructure stands up</p><p>As the typhoon bore down Saturday with heavy rains and strong winds, the usually crowded train stations and streets of Tokyo were deserted with people advised to stay indoors. But life was quickly returning to normal under crisp clear skies Sunday.</p><p>About 17,000 police and military troops were on standby for rescue operations.</p><p>Evacuation centers had been set up in coastal towns with tens of thousands seeking shelter. Kyodo News service said evacuation warnings had been issued to more than 6 million people.</p><p>The typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed from Saturday to Sunday.</p><p>The authorities had repeatedly warned Hagibis was on par with a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958. But the safety infrastructure that Japan's modernization had brought were apparent. The typhoon six decades ago had left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-8JN1-JB5P-J04J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

Supachok, Theerathon, Pansa and Narubadin on Saturdayreturned to full training for Thailand's third Asian Zone Group G battle at Thammasat Stadium.</p><p> While Thailand coach Akira Nishino welcomed the return to fitness of the four players, he said his biggest worry was to find a way and make up for crafty playmaker Chanathip Songkrasin's absence from Tuesday's match. \"It is always difficult to replace a player of Chanathip's calibre.</p><p> We are looking at different options to minimise the impact of his absence,\" said Nishino. \"I have come up against the UAE in the past when I was coaching Japan.</p><p> They are a very good team. \"We have no plans to mark any specific players but we will rather concentrate on moving up as a team to put them under pressure.</p><p>\" Meanwhile, the UAE will be hoping to maintain their winning run on Tuesday. The UAE have won both their Group G games, the latest one being a 5-0 thrashing of Indonesia on Thursday after their away win at Malaysia.</p><p> They are group leaders with six points from two games, ahead of Thailand and Vietnam who have four. UAE coach Bert van Marwijk said his team should have scored more goals against Indonesia.</p><p> \"We still have a difficult match against Thailand but the most important thing now is that we have a perfect record from the two matches that we played.\"  hr class=\"dot-double Do you like the content of this article?   !-- article-news detail --       MOST RECENT  class=\"icon-arrow    World Flooded capital Four people were killed and 17 were missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades paralysed Tokyo.</p><p>  08:01     Business Only 'baby step' A partial US-China deal may only offer a temporary tariff reprieve because it lacks specifics and leaves the thorny issues for later, analysts said.  07:45     Thailand Typhoon delays The Immigration Bureau is taking steps to deal with congestion caused by flight delays at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>  07:11          section   MORE IN SECTION    !--  --!-- footer -- !-- /footer -- </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG13102019027786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X85-WM91-F00C-60M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 13, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX323</classCode><className>BANGKOK, THAILAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GC305</classCode><className>INDONESIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC308</classCode><className>MALAYSIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The typhoon killed at least 80 people and prompted the postponement of a planned celebratory parade.</p><p>Congratulatory banners were flying at some subway stations and street corners, but the public response was a far cry from the celebrations in May when Naruhito's accession coincided with an unusual 10-day holiday period.</p><p>Small groups of people waited at the Imperial Palace gate on Tuesday in pouring rain, waving Japanese flags and cheering a smiling Naruhito as he entered by car.</p><p>The first Japanese emperor born after World War II, Naruhito acceded to the throne when his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries after worrying that advancing age might make it hard to perform official duties.</p><p>As he is young and energetic with outstanding leadership, I hope he'll support the people of Japan, which has faced continuous disasters and typhoons, said Tomoko Shirakawa, 51, who was waiting in front of the palace.</p><p>Naruhito began the day's ceremonies by reporting his enthronement to his imperial ancestors at one of three shrines on the palace grounds, dressed in a black headdress and pure white robes with a long train borne by an attendant.</p><p>He was followed later by Empress Masako, dressed in 12-layered white robes and attended by two women in violet robes to arrange her train.</p><p>Tradition-bound ceremony</p><p>For the main ceremony, Naruhito will wear a traditional burnt-orange robe and headdress, as his father did nearly three decades ago. It will start at 1:00 p.m. at the Imperial Palace's Matsu no Ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious space in the palace.</p><p>He will declare his enthronement from the Takamikura - a 6.5-metre-high pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes - with an ancient sword and a jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him.</p><p>Together with a mirror called Yata-no-Kagami, which is kept at the Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest site in Japan's Shinto religion, the three treasures comprise the regalia that symbolize the legitimacy of the emperor.</p><p>Masako will also take part in the ceremony, gaining her own throne while wearing 12-layered robes and an elaborate hairstyle.</p><p>Akihito pledged during his own ceremony in 1990 to observe Japan's pacifist constitution and fulfill his duty as a symbol of the state and for the unity of the people. Naruhito promised to follow his father's path and observers have noted he has so far made only small changes.</p><p>It'll be nice if the new emperor will be as kind hearted as the former emperor and stay close to the people, said Ryoya Suzuki, 25, in front of the palace.</p><p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a congratulatory speech before guests including Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Britain's Prince Charles, who with then-wife Princess Diana attended Akihito's enthronement. U.S. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao is also expected to attend.</p><p>A court banquet will be held on Tuesday night, before Naruhito and Masako host a tea party for foreign royalty on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>A celebratory parade has been postponed until Nov. 10 while the government devotes its attention to coping with the aftermath of the typhoon. Still, NHK, the national broadcaster, said there were 26,000 police providing security on Tuesday.</p><p>(The Irrawaddy)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB6-93R1-DXMS-821G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DDNJ</classCode><className>ROYAL SUCCESSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DDNJ</classCode><className>ROYAL SUCCESSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N488210MM</classCode><className>RAIL STATIONS &amp; TERMINALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>PE000DO1B</classCode><className>NARUHITO, EMPEROR OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

One of seven Chinese crew members was rescued and six were killed. After the accident happened, the Chinese Embassy in Japan immediately activated the emergency mechanism, contacted the Japanese side to verify and gather relevant information, visited the rescued sailor and provided assistance to the families of those killed for follow-up matters.

Analysts say that it will lead to a humanitarian disaster and will destroy counter-terrorism outcomes by giving terrorists detained near Turkish-Syrian border a chance to escape. I wonder if you have any comment?</p><p>A: China opposes the use of force in international relations. We believe all sides should observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as well as the basic norms governing international relations, and solve problems through political and diplomatic means under the framework of international law. Syria's sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity should be earnestly respected and safeguarded. We call on Turkey to stop its military actions and come back to the right course of political settlement.</p><p>Considering the severe situation for counterterrorism in Syria at the moment, relevant military actions may lead to the outbound escape of terrorists and the resurgence of the Islamic State. We urge Turkey to take up its responsibilities and combat terrorism with the rest of the international community.</p><p>Q: LeBron James, a basketball player, said that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was \"misinformed\" when he tweeted about Hong Kong and warned others on the negative ramifications about freedom of speech. Does the Chinese side agree with James' statement?</p><p>A: I responded to similar questions many times. Here I'd like to reiterate that sports exchange has played a positive role in China-US friendship and relations. However, an important prerequisite for exchange and cooperation is mutual respect. It is true in China, the US and everywhere else.</p><p>Q: The 13th round of China-US trade talks was recently held in Washington. The US side said that both sides reached substantial phase one agreement. The Chinese side said that both sides made substantive progress in some areas and agreed to work toward reaching a final agreement. I wonder if the two teams have the same understanding of this issue?</p><p>A: What the US side said is true, and it is the same with our understanding on this agreement. This economic and trade agreement will be very important. It will bring benefits to China, the US and the world, and it will contribute to trade and peace.</p><p>Q: The US side said recently that China has begun purchasing large amounts of American agricultural products, which has caught extensive attention from both within China and all over the world. Can you give us more details on China's purchases of American agricultural goods this year?</p><p>A: Many journalists have been asking us about the purchases, and we specifically consulted the competent authorities for this. As I know, Chinese companies independently purchased US agricultural products following market principles and based on domestic demand.</p><p>According to the preliminary statistics, this year, Chinese companies have purchased 20 million tons of soybeans, 700,000 tons of pork, 700,000 tons of sorghum, 230,000 tons of wheat and 320,000 tons of cotton from the US. We will step up purchases of American agricultural goods.</p><p>Q: When did China start purchasing American agricultural products?</p><p>A: As I stated earlier, the purchasing amount I gave you is that of this year for now.</p><p>(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8W-R631-JB5P-J2D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Kyodo News agency, citing its own tally, put the death toll at 69.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Abe pledged to do the utmost for the safety and rescue of those missing or those who had to evacuate.</p><p>\"We put the people's lives first,\" he said.</p><p>Hagibis hit Japan's main island on Saturday with strong winds and historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power. Rescue crews on Tuesday were still searching for those missing, thought to number about 20.</p><p>Some 34,000 homes were without power and 110,000 lacked running water. More than 30,000 people were still at shelters as of late Monday, according to the Cabinet Office's latest tally.</p><p>Business appeared nearly back to normal in central Tokyo, and residents in areas where floodwater subsided started cleaning up. Lives, however, remained paralyzed in Nagano, Fukishima and other hard-hit areas that were still inundated.</p><p>Some residents in Nagano returned to their homes, only to find they not be habitable.</p><p>Retired carpenter Toshitaka Yoshimura, who grew up in the Tsuno district of Nagano, was stunned when he returned to his home after staying at an evacuation center during the storm. His house was a mess. Doors were knocked out, his handmade furniture was tossed around and damaged, and everything from a futon to electronics were broken and covered with mud.</p><p>\"I put a lot of effort in this house. I made all the furniture with my wife. Now look what happened in one day,\" he said, with his voice trembling with emotion. \"Now this makes me want to cry.\"</p><p>At least some of his memorable photos with his family and relatives were intact, along with toys and games that his younger relatives played when they gathered at his house.</p><p>\"I'm glad they survived at least,\" said his nephew Kazuki Yoshimura. \"Perhaps we can still do something about the house, but nothing can be more precious than life.\"</p><p>In Fukushima, 11 bags containing possibly radioactive soil and debris removed as part of decontamination efforts from the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, were washed from two outdoor temporary storage sites and found downstream, the Environment Ministry said. Most of the remaining 5,000 bags stacked up at the two sites _ one in Tamura City and another Iitate _ remained in place.</p><p>There was no risk to the environment because the waterproof bags were intact and hadn't leaked, the ministry said. It said, however, officials will take preventive measures ahead of future rainstorms.</p><p>A massive number of such bags are still being kept at 760 similar sites across Fukushima. Their transfer to a longer-term storage facility near the plant is expected to be completed by March 2022.</p><p>Speaking in parliament, Abe said there are concerns of lasting effects of the storm in hard-hit areas. He pledged speedy support for residents.</p><p>Abe said the government is funding the disaster response from the 500-billion yen ($4.6 billion) special reserve from the fiscal 2019 budget and may compile a supplementary budget if needed.</p><p>West Japan Railway Co. said its Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train services connecting Tokyo and Kanazawa in the central north were reduced because of flooding of six trains at its railyard in Nagano. The trains sat in a pool of muddy water that was up to their windows.</p><p>Questions have been raised about the site of the railyard, which sits in an area noted on a prefectural hazard map as a flood area. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the operator's preparedness should be investigated later but the priority is to get the trains out of the water. Some water has been pumped out, but more than half of the railyard is still underwater. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X93-Y8N1-JB5P-J3V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002C6L</classCode><className>TOKYO ELECTRIC POWER CO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>9501 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Normally the western Pacific island gets hit head on by three to four typhoons ever year from June through October. Typhoons, which pack higher winds than other tropical storms, often kill five to 10 people per event and destroy infrastructure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for the past three years Taiwan and the Philippines, an archipelago to its south, have missed their historical average typhoon counts because of high water temperatures over the mid-Pacific where typhoons originate and shifts in upper-atmosphere winds, meteorologists believe.</p><p>The Philippines can get up to 20 of the raging storms per year. The systems called cyclones and hurricanes in other parts of the world bring winds strong enough to blow down trees and rainfall that can quickly turn streets into rivers. They typically prompt mass evacuations and shut down transportation including flights.</p><p>General bias is in the Indian Ocean and in the Pacific has been for waters to be warmer than normal and global warming may have something to do with that, according to Jason Nicholls, senior meteorologist with American forecasting service AccuWeather.</p><p>Warmer waters</p><p>Ocean temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean have heated up since 2017, causing typhoons to form relatively far from Taiwan and the Philippines that lie to the west, Nicholls said.</p><p>Upper-level steering winds ultimately push the storms north, eventually affecting Japan, South Korea and eastern China, he said. They have more time to get picked up and curved off to the north and northeast, Nicholls said.</p><p>Western Pacific waters are relatively cool this year, he said, meaning fewer storms form near the east coasts of Taiwan or the Philippines.</p><p>Warm waters remain around the equator near the international dateline, he said. In the 1980s and 1990s waters around the Pacific and Indian oceans were cooler as a general rule.</p><p>Asia's deadliest storms each year, including the 2013 super-typhoon that killed 6,340, often reach the Philippines, a largely impoverished country that has struggled historically to cope. No full-blown typhoons, only weaker tropical storms, have made landfall there to date this year.</p><p>Heading north</p><p>Most of the 21 typhoons in Asia this year so far reached Japan, South Korea and China because of the northbound trend. The most severe, Typhoon Hagibis, killed 80 people in eastern Japan earlier this month.</p><p>If in a situation where Pacific Ocean high pressure is weak and higher north, before reaching Taiwan typhoons will follow the high pressure northward and reach Japan, said Chen Meng-shih, long-range forecast section chief with Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau.</p><p>Warming ocean temperatures will drive cyclonic storm activity, the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists said in a December 2018 report. Other scientific reports say ocean temperatures will make the storms stronger.</p><p>Ocean temperatures are going up because the water absorbs heat from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from fossil fuel consumption, the civic group International Union for Conservation of Nature says.</p><p>Too wet or not wet enough?</p><p>Lack of typhoons has spared crops, infrastructure and human lives. Typhoon Mitag, Taiwan's biggest storm of 2019, caused just $60,485 in crop damage, the government's Council of Agriculture found. Mitag passed east of the island on October 1.</p><p>In a more typical case, Typhoon Soudelor killed six people, cancelled 300 flights and cost farmers $9.42 million in Taiwan.</p><p>In the Philippines, dry weather has accelerated municipal-level infrastructure projects that heavy rainfall could otherwise delay, said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist with Banco de Oro UniBank in metro Manila. The government is in the midst of a 5-year, $169 billion infrastructure renewal drive to attract investment.</p><p>Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist with Banco de Oro UniBank in metro Manila</p><p>Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist with Banco de Oro UniBank in metro Manila.</p><p>But the dearth of typhoons has cut valuable rainfall too, Ravelas said. Parts of Metro Manila have rationed water this year partly for lack of precipitation.</p><p>You'd rather have more rains but on the other side you have lots of calamities, he said.

It was a 'sweet' day for Thai shooter Napis Tortungpanich and badminton star Ratchanok Intanon as both scored wins for the Kingdom at the SEA Games in the Philippines on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Napis, who is reportedly dating Ratchanok, won the gold medal in the men's 10m air rifle. The 24-year-old shooter amassed 250.6 points to beat Indonesia's Gustafian Fathur (248.4) and Singapore's Abdul Rahman (225.9).</p><p> Having won two SEA Games gold medals ahead of Philippines 2019, Napis said it wasn't an easy competition. \"Athletes from other countries have also improved particularly those from Indonesia,\" he said.</p><p> He said he had not talked to Ratchanok much lately because they had to switch their focus to the Philippines Games. \"But I received an encouraging message from her before Tuesday's competition,\" said Napis, who will next team up with Thararat Morakot in the 10m air rifle doubles.</p><p> \"I will go to cheer May [Ratchanok's nickname] tomorrow.\" Ratchanok, also 24, on Monday helped the Thai women's team beat Malaysia 3-0 in the semi-finals, defeating Chea Soniia Su Ya 21-17, 21-41. Rawinda Prajongjai and Puttita Supajirakul beat Chow Me Kuanm and Lee Meng Yean 24-22, 21-18. Busanan Ongbamrungphan then finished off Malaysia with a 2-1 (15-21, 21-11, 21-12) win over Selvaduray Kisona.</p><p> In Tuesday's final, the Thai suttlers will meet Indonesia, who defeated Singapore 3-1 in the last four on Monday. Thailand are chasing their fourth straight SEA Games gold medal in the women's team event.</p><p> Ratchanok will only play in the team competition as she is scheduled to take part in the BWF World Tour Finals in Guangzhou, China, next week. Hosts 'ready' for Kammuri SEA Games venues and officials in the Manila region said on Monday they are \"ready\" as powerful Typhoon Kammuri churned towards the Philippines.</p><p> There was no talk of cancelling the Games as the storm headed for a swathe of the nation's north that includes key competition hubs as well as thousands of athletes, and had already impacted scheduling. Forecasters predict the typhoon will make landfall early Tuesday hundreds of kilometres southeast of the capital, with intense rains and potent wind gusts of up to 185kph (115mph).</p><p> \"Everything is set,\" Ramon Suzara, COO of organising committee Phisgoc, told journalists on Monday. \"For contingency, all venues, all competition managers, technical delegates are ready.</p><p>\" Kammuri caused problems for the competition's plans before landfall. Windsurfing was halted as a precaution and triathlon events were held earlier than scheduled, an official said at the weekend.</p><p> Officials told reporters that each sport is overseen by managers and ultimately they would make the call on any possible cancellations or rescheduling. \"The proper timing of when to postpone them [events] is decided by the technical delegate or the one that is in charge of the sport,\" said Celso Dayrit, SEA Games Executive Committee Chairman.</p><p> As part of the contingency plan \"in place a long time ago\", Games organisers have told venues to dismantle temporary structures like tents for officials, security and catering or outdoor branding over fears they could be ripped away by the strong winds. Organisers did not elaborate on the broader contingency plans or the decision making process, but cited the example of how an indoor event could be impacted.</p><p> \"For example, basketball or volleyball, normally if there are typhoons, which has been done, the competition continues if necessary but without spectators,\" Suzara said. As of Monday, windsurfing was halted as a precaution and triathlon and duathlon events were held earlier than scheduled.</p><p> Suzara ruled out any extension to the Games, which is due to end on Dec 11 after opening on Saturday. Earlier this year at Japan's Rugby World Cup, three matches were cancelled as Typhoon Hagibis approached the country -- one of the biggest and most powerful storms Japan has seen in many years that would eventually kill more than 80 people.</p><p> The sheer size of the storm -- it covered the vast majority of the Japanese archipelago -- and the ferocity of the winds left the organisers with little choice but to cancel the games before landfall. Around 8,750 athletes and team officials are expected at this year's 30th edition of the SEA Games along with another 12,000 volunteers.</p><p> After only two competition days, the Philippines have ready surpassed their 24 gold medal tally at the previous Games in Malaysia in 2017. Thanks to their dominance in dance sport and arnis, the country's martial art, the Philippines have won 39 titles at press time last night. Vietnam were distant second with a haul of 15 gold medals, with Thailand in fifth place with six titles to their credit.</p><p>bangkok postafp </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG03122019030046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN2-K6N1-JCH9-G51Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>Business &amp;

A few days before the typhoon arrived, instructions were given to the population on how to stay safe.</p><p> Individuals were asked to clear their balconies and not to leave anything behind, not even small items such as hangers or clips as they could possibly be blown away by the storm. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- who was leading the war room -- won praise for his leadership.</p><p> Moreover, the ability of the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, located in Saitama about 35km from Tokyo, to efficiently divert flood water was nothing short of impressive. Over the past week, we haven't heard any big words such as smart cities or smart devices from the Japanese cabinet.</p><p> Neither did Mr Abe's government ask the public for donations to help the typhoon victims. Instead, the government immediately allocated 710 million yen (almost 200 million baht) from its 2019 fiscal budget reserves to tackle the killer storm and its aftermath.</p><p> On social media, photos of several Japanese cities went viral since the typhoon first hit the country. Most photos showed how the country had been damaged by the worst storm to hit the country in decades, with some regions getting up to three feet of rain in just 24 hours.</p><p> Among the images shared which won praise from netizens were a pair of photos featuring a village inundated with water which did not have a single piece of rubbish. It was a testament to the country's efficient waste management system and duty to public responsibility.</p><p> Without trash, water could flow away unrestricted. Japan's cities are well-planned and so resilient that they can return to normal without delay when natural disasters strike.</p><p> Last September, Kansai International Airport was able to resume full service in just 17 days after being hit by Typhoon Jebi which had led to floods and damaged an access bridge. In comparison, things are far different in Thailand.</p><p> For example, look at Ubon Ratchathani in the Northeast which was battered by tropical storms Podul and Kajiki or how about Bangkok which gets flooded every time a depression lashes the city. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration always makes excuses such as the presence of too many reckless people who litter leading to rubbish clogging city sewage pipes.</p><p> Even though the capital boasts of having a giant tunnel to drain flood water, does anyone have an idea if it is really helpful? Imagine if a typhoon hit the city! I had a chance to visit Ubon Ratchathani last week, exactly one month after it was hit by the worst flooding in 17 years. Business in the province appeared to be slowly returning to normal, however, there were traces of the disaster the flooding had left behind.</p><p> The cleanup was ongoing at a snail's pace which meant that murky water could still be seen almost everywhere. Rubbish, small items like plastic bags and big items like beds were still scattered in the middle of fields.</p><p> It's not too difficult to imagine how such trash was swept away somewhere from the city by the floods. Some villagers outside Muang district that I met have not been able to get back on their feet because their rice crops were destroyed, leaving them empty rice stock for next year.</p><p> It will take a few more months to receive any compensation from the government. Remember Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's frustration when facing the glut of complaints from flood victims about sluggish help from the state.</p><p> He barked: \"Wherever I go, people always ask for money!\" He then made a plea for public donations. It's been more than a month now but our leader only just made the promise last week that the government would try to accelerate cash assistance disbursement.</p><p> The trip to Ubon Ratchathani gave me a strange impression. Our disaster was so small, compared to what Japan faced, yet as we know the situation in the Northeast was far worse because of mismanagement and lack of preparation as well as questionable development projects that resulted in a \"man-made disaster\".</p><p>Thailand is unique in that our leader can blame political enemies for such a disaster and is always ready for a war of words. During an inspection trip to Ubon Ratchathani, Gen Prayut lashed out at Pheu Thai MPs.</p><p> Obviously he's frustrated. But his frustrations can hardly be compared to those of flood victims.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG18102019028083</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBC-HH01-F00C-638M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFIV</classCode><className>VIRAL VIDEOS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DSB4</classCode><className>SMART CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFIV</classCode><className>VIRAL VIDEOS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N221320MM</classCode><className>SEWERAGE SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000218</classCode><className>BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DADF</classCode><className>SHINZO ABE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX323</classCode><className>BANGKOK, THAILAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of dangerously heavy rainfall in Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, including Gunma, Saitama and Kanagawa, and later expanded the area to include Fukushima and Miyagi to the north.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earthquake shook the area drenched by the rainfall shortly before the typhoon made landfall in Shizuoka prefecture on Saturday evening. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 5.3 quake was centered in the ocean off the coast of Chiba, near Tokyo, and was fairly deep, at 59.5 kilometers (37 miles). Deep quakes tend to cause less damage than shallow ones.</p><p>Be ready for rainfall of the kind that you have never experienced, said meteorological agency official Yasushi Kajihara, adding that areas usually safe from disasters may prove vulnerable.</p><p>Take all measures necessary to save your life, he said.</p><p>Kajihara said people who live near rivers should take shelter on the second floor or higher of any sturdy building if an officially designated evacuation center wasn't easily accessible. He also expressed fears that disaster may have already struck in some areas.</p><p>Hagibis, which means speed in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour on Saturday evening, according to the meteorological agency. It was traveling toward Tokyo and northern Japan at a speed of 35 kph (22 mph).</p><p>The storm brought heavy rainfall in wide areas of Japan all day ahead of its landfall, including in Shizuoka and Mie prefectures, southwest of Tokyo, as well as Chiba to the north, which saw power outages and damaged homes in a typhoon last month.</p><p>Under gloomy skies, a tornado ripped through Chiba on Saturday, overturning a car in the city of Ichihara and killing a man inside the vehicle, city official Tatsuya Sakamaki said. Five people were injured when the tornado ripped through a house. Their injuries were not life-threatening, Sakamaki said.</p><p>Public broadcaster NHK put the storm's toll at one dead, four missing and 51 injured in 19 prefectures.</p><p>The heavy rain caused rivers to swell, flipped anchored boats and whipped up sea waters in a dangerous surge along the coast, flooding some residential neighborhoods and leaving people to wade in ankle-deep waters and cars floating.</p><p>In Shizuoka, one of two men who went missing in the Nishikawa River was rescued, Gotemba city official Fumihiko Katsumata said. Firefighters said the two men were working at a river canal to try to control overflowing when they were swept away.</p><p>Yusuke Ikegaya, a Shizuoka resident who evacuated ahead of the storm, said he was surprised that the nearby river was about to overflow in the morning, hours before the typhoon made landfall.</p><p>In the 28 years of my life, this is the first time I've had to evacuate even before a typhoon has landed, he said.</p><p>Authorities also warned of mudslides, common in mountainous Japan.</p><p>Shiroyama dam in Kanagawa prefecture, also southwest of Tokyo, and three other dams may release some of their waters, which were nearing limits, NHK reported. An overflooded dam is likely to cause greater damage, and so releasing some water gradually is a standard emergency measure.</p><p>Rugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events in the area were canceled, while flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier in the week, including urging people to stay indoors.</p><p>Some 17,000 police and military troops were called up, standing ready for rescue operations.</p><p>Residents taped up their apartment windows to prevent them from shattering. TV talks shows showed footage of household items like a slipper bashing through glass when hurled by winds.</p><p>Evacuation advisories were issued for risk areas, including Shimoda city, west of Tokyo. Dozens of evacuation centers were set up in coastal towns, and people rested on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed.</p><p>The typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed to Sunday. The Defense Ministry cut a three-day annual navy review to a single day on Monday.</p><p>All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines grounded most domestic and international flights at the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya airports. Central Japan Railway Co. canceled bullet-train service between Tokyo and Osaka except for several early Saturday trains connecting Nagoya and Osaka. Tokyo Disneyland was closed, while Ginza department stores and smaller shops throughout Tokyo were shuttered.</p><p>A typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-8JN1-JB5P-J047-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

There he met with government ministers, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p><p>Abe reportedly told Min Aung Hlaing that the Myanmar military should address the allegations of human-rights violations in Rakhine state by implementing proposals from the government-created International Commission of Inquiry. Abe apparently did not mention ongoing efforts by the UN and concerned governments to carry out a genuinely independent and impartial investigation into the atrocities, according to a Defense Ministry press release.</p><p>Japan's diplomatic embrace of Min Aung Hlaing, who was sanctioned by the US in July for the extrajudicial killings of Rohingya, is Tokyo's latest betrayal of its human-rights values as its diplomacy remains focused on fending off China while seeking economic opportunities in Myanmar and beyond.</p><p>In August 2017, Min Aung Hlaing deployed two notoriously abusive military units to Rakhine state, where they led a large-scale campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove more than 740,000 Rohingya out of Myanmar. As of today, nearly a million Rohingya live in overcrowded, flood-prone refugee camps in Bangladesh, while another 600,000 in Myanmar are confined to camps and villages under guard of local authorities and security forces who deny them freedom of movement and other basic rights.</p><p>Last year, the UN-backed Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar found that the violence inflicted by the military on the Rohingya population was carried out under direct orders from Min Aung Hlaing. In reaching the broader conclusion of genocidal intent, the fact-finding mission analyzed Min Aung Hlaing's statements and social-media posts - such as his declaration to solve the country's Bengali problem - and found that they revealed a disturbingly discriminatory understanding of the role of the Myanmar security forces and a flagrant disregard for one of the core principles of international human rights law, non-discrimination and equal protection.</p><p>Further credible evidence of the Myanmar military's atrocities against the Rohingya has been amassed by independent human-rights organizations and the media. The Japanese government, however, remains uncooperative to any international effort to hold those responsible for grave crimes in Myanmar, and has been particularly hesitant to support the UN's new Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.</p><p>At the recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Japan once again abstained from voting on a resolution on Myanmar, prompting Myanmar's ambassador to Japan, Myint Thu, to thank Japan for its abstention.</p><p>Japan's willingness to overlook Min Aung Hlaing's sordid record reflects Tokyo's much larger betrayal of its democratic values in foreign policy. Competing with China for the good graces of even the worst human-rights abusers seems to be Japan's strategy. Tokyo also has ambitions of reaping economic benefits through investments in Myanmar by ignoring the Rohingya crisis. Since July, four investment forums specifically geared toward business opportunities in Myanmar were held in Japan, all organized or sponsored by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).</p><p>At the most recent forum in Tokyo on Monday, Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, received a big round of applause as she entered the ceremony hall.</p><p>We sincerely hope that we can continue to receive the support and understanding of our friends from around the world, including Japan, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told several hundred investors and businesspeople. She never mentioned the plight of the Rohingya in refugee camps or those locked down in Rakhine state.</p><p>Earlier this year, in anticipation of renewing its seat at the UN Human Rights Council, Japan stated that it firmly believes that the promotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate interest of the international community... Therefore, grave violations of human rights need to be addressed in cooperation with the international community.</p><p>In the short term, enabling Japanese companies and investors to dive into the Southeast Asian market while ignoring human rights may appear beneficial in competing with China. In the long term, however, this will only encourage rights-abusing governments to resist democratic reforms, perpetuating human-rights abuses across the region.</p><p>So far, Japan's commitment to human rights in its foreign policy has proved farcical, but it can get back on track by pursuing justice for the Rohingya by supporting the new UN investigative mechanism. Japan should start voting in favor of Myanmar-related resolutions at the UN, such as at the upcoming General Assembly Third Committee session in November.</p><p>The Japanese government should never again welcome to Tokyo a military leader who oversaw the murder, rape, and mass deportation of an ethnic minority. Min Aung Hlaing belongs before an international criminal court, facing justice for his actions against the Rohingya - not feted by Japan's leaders.</p><p>Source: Human Rights Watch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-2081-DXMS-8389-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Military &amp;

He acceded to the throne when his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries, worried that advancing age might make it hard to perform official duties.</p><p>The long-planned celebrations, for which Japan declared a national holiday, were tempered following Typhoon Hagibis, which killed at least 82 people when it tore through Japan 10 days ago, and pouring rain early on Tuesday.</p><p>A public parade was postponed until next month to allow the government to devote attention to the typhoon cleanup, while Tuesday's weather forced the palace to scale back the number of courtiers in ancient robes taking part in the courtyard ceremony.</p><p>But just before the ceremony began, the skies cleared and a rainbow appeared over Tokyo.</p><p>Storm-like rain and winds came to a stop right before the ceremony, and the sun came out. I, along with people around me, were moved, tweeted lawmaker Kentaro Sonoura, who attended the ceremony.</p><p>'Banzai!'</p><p>At the sound of a gong in the Matsu-no-Ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious room in the palace, two courtiers bowed deeply and drew back purple curtains on the Takamikura - a 6.5-metre-high pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes.</p><p>Naruhito was revealed standing in front of a simple throne, dressed in burnt-orange robes and a black headdress, with an ancient sword and a boxed jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him.</p><p>Fifty-five-year-old Harvard-educated Empress Masako, wearing heavy 12-layered robes and with hair flowing down her back, stood in front of a smaller throne to the side. Such traditional robes can weigh around 15 kilograms.</p><p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delivered a congratulatory speech before assembled dignitaries including Crown Prince Akishino, the emperor's younger brother, and his family, all adorned in brightly colored robes. Other guests included US Transport Secretary Elaine Chao and Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><p>Abe led a trio of cheers of banzai, or long life, for the emperor, before a 21-gun salute. Guests from overseas were not required to join in shouting the phrase, which for some raises memories of the wartime emperor worship.</p><p>Naruhito had entered the palace to cheers from admirers before reporting his enthronement to his imperial ancestors at three shrines on the palace grounds, dressed in pure white robes.</p><p>As he is young and energetic with outstanding leadership, I hope he'll support the people of Japan, which has faced continuous disasters and typhoons, said Tomoko Shirakawa, 51, who was among the crowds of umbrella-clutching citizens packing the area in front of the palace.</p><p>A court banquet was held on Tuesday evening, and Naruhito and Masako are due to host a tea party for foreign royalty on Wednesday afternoon. The government pardoned about half a million people convicted of petty crimes, such as traffic violations, to mark the day.</p><p>Although the public parade was postponed until Nov. 10, NHK public TV said there were 26,000 police providing security.</p><p>Future of the monarchy</p><p>Naruhito is unusual among recent Japanese emperors in that his only child, 17-year-old Aiko, is female and cannot inherit the throne under current law. Unless the law is revised, the future of the imperial family for coming generations rests instead on the shoulders of his nephew, 13-year-old Hisahito, who is second in line for the throne after his father, Crown Prince Akishino.</p><p>Naruhito's grandfather, Hirohito, in whose name Japanese troops fought World War II, was treated as a god but renounced his divine status after Japan's defeat in 1945. Emperors now have no political authority.</p><p>Though many Japanese welcomed the enthronement ceremony, there was a demonstration in downtown Tokyo in protest against the imperial system, and three demonstrators were arrested after jostling with riot police, Kyodo news agency reported. Tokyo police declined to comment.</p><p>There is no need for such an elaborate ceremony. Traffic has been restricted and it is causing inconvenience for ordinary people, said Yoshikazu Arai, 74, a retired surgeon.</p><p>The emperor is necessary now as a symbol of the people, but at some point, the emperor will no longer be necessary. Things will be just fine without an emperor.</p><p>(The Irrawaddy)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-7HB1-DXMS-82RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"874\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLCL</classCode><className>MONARCHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>PE000DO1B</classCode><className>NARUHITO, EMPEROR OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009YB3</classCode><className>CHARLES III, KING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DADF</classCode><className>SHINZO ABE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It has been a year of records so far, and October 2018 was - by a small margin - the warmest October on record, with global temperatures an average of 1.3 degrees Centigrade above the pre-industrial average.</p><p>It was warmer, and it was also wetter. Across southern Ireland, the UK, France, Benelux, Germany, the Baltics, up into Russia there was higher rainfall than the 1981-2010 average.</p><p>That wasn't the case across the Mediterranean region, nor in the Black Sea area and eastern Europe, where there was lower than average rainfall.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan hard in the month of October - meaning heavy rainfall two times higher than average.</p><p>Carbon cycles</p><p>The warming trend that we have been reporting is due to rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere, trapping more heat. It's known as the greenhouse effect.</p><p>If you look at graphs of CO2 levels a clear rise is visible as mankind's industrial activities pump gas into the atmosphere. The other clear trend is that CO2 levels rise and fall every year, according to the seasons. The levels are higher in late winter and early spring, and then decrease as plants and trees suck up the gas as they grow.</p><p>It raises the question of how carbon dioxide levels are currently measured, and whether we can we tell the difference between CO2 from plants and trees, and CO2 made by man.</p><p>Up at the Observatory of the Puy de Dome</p><p>That topic is a focus of research for Michel Ramonet, a scientist at from the French research organisation CNRS and the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement, and we met him at the Observatory of the Puy de Dome, in the Auvergne-Rh\\xF4ne-Alpes region of France.</p><p>The observatory measures CO2 and other atmospheric components every second of the day, sending the information about greenhouse gases to the Copernicus Climate Change Service every 24 hours.</p><p>At the moment, carbon dioxide levels are at 415 parts per million in the atmosphere on average, compared to the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million. \"We have a rise of about 2 to 3 parts per million per year,\" says Ramonet.</p><p>The rise in CO2 has spiked considerably in recent decades. When Ramonet began his career in the late 1980s his first measurements of CO2 had values around 300 parts per million.</p><p>Natural cycles of growth and decay can lead to the level of CO2 rising or falling by 15 to 20 parts per million.</p><p>Half of emissions absorbed by nature</p><p>Humans are responsible for the CO2 rise, emitting over 36 gigatonnes of CO2 last year. However, humanity is 'living on credit' from nature for the moment, with half of those emissions currently being absorbed by nature - with 30% going into plants and trees, and 20% going into the oceans.</p><p>For now, nature keeps pace with humanity, capturing half of our emissions. \"That's the good news,\" says Ramonet. \"The bad news is that living on credit for a long time is risky, so we do not know if these natural wells, so-called carbon sinks, will last forever. \"</p><p>Carbon dioxide mixes quickly into the atmosphere, so it's a huge challenge to know which emissions come from where.</p><p>\"We measure the total concentration level of CO2, and we'd love to be able to give this CO2 a colour, to have green CO2 for vegetation and black for when it comes from cars, but we don't have an easy tool to do that,\" he says.</p><p>The scientists believe they have an answer, using other gases like nitrogen oxide and certain carbon isotopes to link CO2 in the atmosphere to human activity. It's cutting edge science, and expensive, meaning it hasn't been widely rolled out.</p><p>More monitoring stations needed</p><p>The scientists are also determined to gather more data. They are working to have more CO2 monitoring stations around cities as well as at atmospheric observatories, and to deploy a new European satellite to measure remote areas from space.</p><p>Ramonet explains: \"There are areas of the world where there are almost no measurements - in Africa, the Amazon, Siberia - and these are key regions for understanding the global carbon cycle and interactions with the ecosystems on land in particular, be it the Amazonian forest, or the tropical forest in Africa. So we're desperately lacking in situ measurements.\"</p><p>Those measurements matter for several reasons. For example, Ramonet's research shows that during the 2018 heatwave in Europe last year the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by nature decreased because the plants became more stressed and less active. Land use changes such as deforestation and reforestation can also change a country's carbon budget.</p><p>There's intense interest in being able to better understand where emissions come from, where carbon sinks are to be found, and who is polluting the most. Such evidence is used by countries to judge how effective their emissions reduction policies really are.</p><p>However, Ramonet stresses that we should not be too optimistic about the effect of carbon dioxide reduction schemes in the short term, simply because of the relatively slow reaction of nature to any change.</p><p>\"The actions that can and should be taken now are aimed at reducing the acceleration of CO2 levels for future generations. Today's actions will have an effect in only 30, 50 years. Hence the difficulty to motivate society to take them today,\" he says.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ5-4D01-DXMS-82YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS0008X1O</classCode><className>AUVERGNE, FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A2L6</classCode><className>ATLANTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR144</classCode><className>BENELUX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GR146</classCode><className>EASTERN EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Julian Ryall reports from Tokyo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scourge of nuclear weapons, difficulties facing immigrant communities and the importance of interfaith dialogue are just some of the issues that Pope Francis is expected to address when he arrives in Japan on Saturday for the first papal visit to the Asian country in 38 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And members of the Catholic Church here anticipate that the pope's visit will breathe new life into their community. \"The Catholic community in Japan looks forward to the apostolic visit with sentiments of joy and gratitude to God,\" said Father Joseph Chennoth, the archbishop of Milevi who was appointed to serve as apostolic nuncio to Japan in August 2011.</p><p>\"It is a great opportunity for Pope Francis to visit Japan, where he wanted to come as a missionary during his youth,\" Chennoth told DW.</p><p>\"As supreme pastor of the church, he has innumerable pastoral concerns for the universal church spread across the world,\" he added. \"Now he comes to Japan to appreciate the strong faith inherited from the martyrs and to encourage the faithful to share the gospel of joy and compassion.\"</p><p>Deeply symbolic visit</p><p>The pope's visit is indeed rich in symbolism. It is significant that he will open his first official visit to Japan in the city of Nagasaki, where Christianity first gained a foothold in feudal Japan nearly 500 years ago, but is today best known as the second city to have been targeted with an atomic weapon during World War II.</p><p>The first Christian missionaries arrived in Kyushu, Japan's most southern main island, with Francis Xavier and the Jesuits stepping ashore in the 1540s and were initially successful in converting as many as 130,000 local people and even local \"daimyo,\" or feudal lords.</p><p>But Emperor Ogimachi began the pushback against what was seen as a foreign influence, and Christianity was repressed from 1587 onward. Opposition to the religion evolved into an outright ban in the early 17th century. Those who refused to reject Christianity were often executed; others - the \"hidden Christians\" - continued to practice their faith in secret.</p><p>Nagasaki is important to the history of Christianity in Japan because six Franciscan missionaries, three Japanese Jesuits and 17 followers of the church, including three boys, were crucified in the city on February 5, 1597, because they refused to recant their faith. Known as the \"Martyrs of Japan,\" they were canonized by the Catholic Church in 1862.</p><p>The last head of the Catholic Church to visit Japan was Pope John Paul II, who in 1981 also visited Nagasaki and met some of the descendants of the early converts who had managed to keep their faith secret.</p><p>Christianity returned openly to Japan after Tokyo ended its policy of seclusion from the outside world in 1853, although followers of the Catholic Church still only account for around 440,000 of the 127 million Japanese people.</p><p>Falling numbers</p><p>\"The number of Japanese Catholics is declining because of diminishing birth rates, an aging population and the modern pressures of life,\" Father Chennoth said. \"But I am sure that the pope's visit will give a new impetus to Catholics to deepen and share their faith with their fellow men by their commitment to building up a more peaceful, compassionate, humane and inclusive society.\"</p><p>While the number of Japanese Catholics may be in decline, the rising number of immigrants from deeply Catholic nations in other parts of Asia, such as the Philippines, means that churches here are still busy, said Father Kizito Mawayira. \"This visit by the pope is deeply significant to us because it shows us again the solidarity of the church,\" said Father Kizito, a Ugandan who serves as pastor at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Yokohama.</p><p>\"We are very much an international congregation and we have people from all over the world attending our masses - from France and India to the US, South Korea, Poland, the Congo, Croatia and many places in Southeast Asia,\" he said.</p><p>Some estimates put the number of foreign-born Catholics living in Japan at 520,000, eclipsing the number of Japanese church-goers, with more places of worship now offering masses in different languages. \"We also have Japanese in our congregation, of course, but mostly they are older people,\" Mawayira said. \"For younger people, there are so many things going on with their schools and other groups at the weekend that they do not always have a chance to attend mass.\"</p><p>Nuclear weapons opposition</p><p>Many Catholics are expected to flock to venues where Pope Francis will give a series of addresses, including in Hiroshima - where he is scheduled to meet with survivors of the atomic bomb that was dropped on the city in 1945 - and Tokyo.</p><p>Through his visit, the pope wants to send a strong message calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide. In a video message released by the Vatican ahead of his trip, the pope told the Japanese people: \"Your country knows well the suffering caused by war. Along with you, I pray that the destructive power of nuclear weapons is never let loose again on human history.

In recent years, under the strategic guidance of the BRICS leaders, the BRICS countries follow the BRICS spirit of open, inclusive and win-win cooperation, promote more in-depth practical cooperation in various fields, deepen solidarity and mutual trust and enhance the well-being of their people, setting a model of a new type of major country relations.</p><p>The Meeting of the BRICS High Representatives for Security Issues is a strategic platform to strengthen political and security cooperation between the BRICS countries and this ninth meeting is an important event ahead of the BRICS Leaders Meeting in Brasilia in November. Facing complex and severe international situation, the BRICS countries will exchange in-depth views on international security situation, major international and regional hotspot issues and bolstering cooperation on counterterrorism and cyber security, make joint efforts to address prominent challenges, uphold their security and development interests and safeguard world peace and stability. China believes that this meeting will achieve positive outcomes, deepen strategic mutual trust among BRICS countries and make political preparations for the upcoming BRICS Leaders Meeting in Brasilia in November.</p><p>Q: I have two questions about the trade talks in Washington last week. The US says China agrees to buy 50 billion dollars worth of US agricultural goods annually. I wonder if China did indeed agree to do that? The US and China have had agreement or close agreement in the past and those agreements have failed or are falling apart, so is China confident that this phase one agreement will last?</p><p>A: As to the latest round of China-U.S. high-level economic and trade consultations, the Chinese side has issued the press release. The two sides had candid, efficient and constructive discussions on trade and economic issues of mutual concern in this round of consultations and made substantive progress in such areas as agriculture, intellectual property protection, exchange rate, financial services, expanding trade cooperation, technology transfer and dispute settlement. The two sides also discussed the arrangement for negotiations going forward and agreed to work towards making a final deal.</p><p>We hope the US will meet China halfway and work together following the principle and direction determined by the two heads of state, properly address each other's concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect and promote the healthy and steady development of our trade and economic relations.</p><p>Q: Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan and caused major casualties and property losses, with many still missing. What's your comment?</p><p>A: China is concerned about the severe typhoon disaster in Japan. We mourn for the victims and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured and hope the people in disaster-stricken areas will come back to normal life and work at an early date.</p><p>Q: This morning Beijing time, US President Trump tweeted that China has already begun buying US agricultural products. Can you confirm that? Or is it just the statement of Trump or the US?</p><p>A: I just gave my response regarding the latest round of China-U.S. high-level economic and trade consultations. As for the specific question, I'd like to refer you to the competent authorities.</p><p>Q: Yesterday President Xi concluded his visit to Nepal. It is the first visit by a Chinese president in 23 years. Both sides signed cooperation agreements and also stressed the BRI and multilateral cooperation. Do you have any comment on that?</p><p>A: Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relationship, our two countries have been respecting, trusting and supporting each other, making this relationship an exemplar of harmonious co-existence between countries of different sizes. President Xi's visit to Nepal was the first visit conducted by a Chinese president in 23 years' time. The two sides issued a joint statement and signed 20 cooperation documents. The outcomes of this successful visit can be concluded in three parts.</p><p>First, the bilateral relationship was elevated to a new height. Following the spirit of sharing weal and woe as well as win-win cooperation, the two sides jointly announced the decision to upgrade the bilateral relations to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity. This new definition charts the course for future development and gives China-Nepal relationship greater influence in the region.</p><p>Second, new progress was made in connectivity. Both sides agreed to create synergies between bilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and Nepal's national policy of developing a land-linked state. The two sides will advance the construction of the trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network in areas of ports, highways, railways, aviation and communication. Both sides also launched the feasibility study of cross-border railway, which is considered a major progress of linking the two countries by transportation despite difficult natural conditions.</p><p>Third, new outcomes were achieved in cooperation featuring good-neighborliness and friendship. China and Nepal agreed to conduct all-dimensional cooperation, especially in trade and investment, post-earthquake reconstruction, energy and tourism. The two sides also agreed to bring our two peoples closer by expanding exchange and cooperation in education, youth and on the sub-national level. As Mount Qomolangma is a symbol of China-Nepal friendship, the two sides will cooperate in climate change and eco-tourism related to Mount Qomolangma, making these projects a new highlight in our bilateral cooperation.</p><p>China is ready to work with Nepal to implement the consensus of our leaders, scale our friendly cooperation to new heights and open a new chapter for bilateral relations.</p><p>Q: China Chamber of Commerce to the EU(CCCEU), based in Brussels, launched its first flagship report on 11 October, which summarized Chinese companies development in Europe and recommended to improve business environment in EU for the EU institutions and EU state governments. I wonder if you have a comment on that?</p><p>A: We noted the Report on the Development of Chinese Enterprises in the EU issued by the CCCEU, the chamber's first flagship report after its establishment in Brussels in 2018.</p><p>We are glad to see that Chinese enterprises generally operate well in Europe, with more Chinese companies establishing R&amp;D centers and factories there. Their investment and cooperation have contributed to employment and livelihood of the local communities as well as the upgrade of Europe's industrial chain in a multi-dimensional way. However, on the other hand, the report noted many worrying challenges and restrictions that Chinese enterprises face, such as limited access of Chinese companies due to the increasing censorship of foreign investment by the EU, restrictions on SOEs and the development of Chinese companies in science, technology, energy and some certain areas, insufficient communication between Chinese enterprises and local governments, etc.</p><p>Europe has always been an advocate of market economy and trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and a supporter and guardian of multilateralism and free trade. We hope the EU side will heed the opinions and demands from the Chinese enterprises, continue to keep its investment market open, and foster a business environment that is fair, transparent, stable and predictable for all foreign companies in Europe including Chinese ones. Under the current circumstances, following the spirit of mutual respect and win-win outcomes, it is important for China and the EU to remain open, inclusive and expand cooperation, which will benefit both and inject greater stability and positive energy into the world.</p><p>Q: Regarding Vice President Wang Qishan's visit to Japan, will he meet with Prime Minister Abe and other leaders? Can you tell us the plans and arrangements for his visit?</p><p>A: As I said earlier, Vice President Wang Qishan is to attend Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony as President Xi Jinping's special envoy. During his visit to Japan, he will be meeting with the Japanese leadership and representatives from various sectors. As I know, besides Tokyo, Vice President Wang will also visit Hokkaido.</p><p>Q: Further to what you said about Nepal, there were expectations of an extradition treaty to be signed during President Xi's visit, can you outline the reasons why it wasn't?</p><p>A: China attaches importance to judicial cooperation with Nepal. Both sides are pleased with the signing of a treaty of judicial assistance on criminal matters during this visit. We hope an extradition treaty will be concluded at an early date.</p><p>Q: As we note, Tencent returned some NBA preseason games to streaming status. Does the Chinese government support this move and what is your comment on it?</p><p>A: I believe you are aware that we generally do not comment on the business behaviors of companies. I'd refer you to the company if you are interested in this matter.</p><p>Sports exchange has played a positive role in China-US relations and friendship. In the meantime, as I said before, an important prerequisite for exchange and cooperation is mutual respect. It is true in China, in the US and everywhere else.</p><p>(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8G-8XX1-DXMS-820H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D17O</classCode><className>BRICS COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has been deemed by Government House reporters a confused hypocrite, but his bigger worries should be about problems among coalition partners. Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit and his top lieutenants are staring at party dissolution and even jail.</p><p>All political protagonists, Thaksin Shinawatra included, go into the new year dreaded and none of them is in a good shape. That the Democrats are not even in the picture tells much about their party's current state of affairs.</p><p>2019 started with a promise, with a general election coming after years under a military rule. But extremely divisive politics quickly overshadowed everything and hopes for a fresh beginning disappeared as soon as vote counts were completed. It cut a swathe through Parliament, the conventional media, the social media, and Thailand as a whole.</p><p>The key players cannot be in fully celebratory moods during this festive season. Prayut's coalition won a couple of by-elections first in Nakhon Pathom and very recently in Khon Kaen and is believed to stand to benefit from a few defections and the uncertainties surrounding the Future Forward Party, but trouble remains unchanged in the grand scheme of things. Pheu Thai has been repeatedly rocked by rumoured or actual rebellion; realistic threats of losing grounds to the new-generation politicians and their supposedly growing fan base; and continued speculation that Thaksin's political and financial commitment to the party will be significantly fading.</p><p>Khon Kaen's by-election loss is not just a physical, but also psychological, blow. It renewed fears that Thaksin is not going all in any more. The defeat, which handed Palang Pracharat an additional parliamentary seat, was by just a couple of thousand votes, something that shouldn't have been a big problem if the man in Dubai had not folded like he did a lot lately, analysts and disgruntled party members said.</p><p>But in greatest jeopardy is Future Forward. The party faces being disbanded by the Constitutional Court, with the judgement day likely to come as soon as early 2020. Worse still, Thanathorn and top executives of the party are being threatened by possibility of jail sentences, a grave trouble that seemingly prompted them to test the waters with the recent Skywalk gathering. The torch of anti-government campaign may have been passed from Thaksin to Thanathorn, so to speak.</p><p>2020 will see more street protests and very likely counter protests. All will look peaceful at the beginning but everyone knows how ugly political demonstrations can turn. The Bangkok gubernatorial election will be an enormously significant contest that will determine not only the government's popularity, but also proclaimed unity between coalition parties and within the opposition bloc itself. A charter amendment drive may not contain issues that concern the well-being of Thais directly, but it can become highly explosive.</p><p>2019 laid the groundwork for what could be a perfect storm, especially if the economy gets staggeringly worse. Political divide may peak next year, compounded by conflicts within the coalition government and the opposition parties themselves. Palang Pracharat, the Democrats and the Bhumjaithai Party cannot see eye to eye, but neither can the Pheu Thai and Future Forward parties.</p><p>Who's the biggest loser? Those who deserve better, of course. In this case it's none of the aforementioned but the Thai public, who will continue to have to put up with old-fashioned, winners-take-all politics featuring costly populism designed to weaken enemies, nepotism which has kept truly qualified people away from key positions, constitutional amendment agendas that only serve to divide and not put food on the table, and national divisiveness cooked up by politicians who only want to protect their own vested interests. -
