Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to MondelezInternationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports MondelezInternationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

The Honourable Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, announced that the Province of British Columbia is contributing an additional $3 million, further strengthening this collaborative effort to improve ecological connectivity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many animals need to reach habitat well beyond the boundaries of protected areas to survive, and ecological connectivity is the movement of these wild species and the flow of natural processes through a landscape. With support from both governments, the Stewardship of Ecological Corridors in British Columbia initiative focuses on identifying, planning, and acting to improve movement through ecological corridors - linkages that connect natural habitats, including protected and conserved areas. Ecological corridors provide biodiversity and human well-being benefits and are vital for the long-term health of ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>1.1 Patents issued to National Research Council of Canada by the US PTO and the EPO on same inventions</p><p>In the past 24 months the following patent was issued by the USPTO and the European Patent Office (EPO) to National Research Council of Canada. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Title</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US PTO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">EPO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">A Method For Correcting Ray Distortions In Tomographic 3d Printing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20240066804; 29 Feb, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4274729; 15 Nov, 2023</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Contract awarded for Phase 2 of Counter Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Capability in support of Operation REASSURANCE</p><p>Ottawa, Ontario, Department of National Defence</p><p>On July 7, 2025, the Government of Canada awarded two contracts for a total value of $169,187,671.90 to CACI, Inc. - FEDERAL as part of the second phase of the Counter Uncrewed Aircraft System (CUAS) Urgent Operational Requirement.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) reminds everyone to follow the laws and guidelines about approaching marine mammals, which vary depending on the species.</p><p>On May 22, 2025, in Campbell River Provincial Court, Stephen Michael White was fined $5,000 after being found guilty in November 2024 of violating Section 7(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

The Honourable Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, announced that the Province of British Columbia is contributing an additional $3 million, further strengthening this collaborative effort to improve ecological connectivity.</p><p>Many animals need to reach habitat well beyond the boundaries of protected areas to survive, and ecological connectivity is the movement of these wild species and the flow of natural processes through a landscape. With support from both governments, the Stewardship of Ecological Corridors in British Columbia initiative focuses on identifying, planning, and acting to improve movement through ecological corridors - linkages that connect natural habitats, including protected and conserved areas. Ecological corridors provide biodiversity and human well-being benefits and are vital for the long-term health of ecosystems.</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Federal government and East Gwillimbury partner to help residents walk a new path</p><p>East Gwillimbury will expand its active transportation network thanks to a joint investment of $7.6 million with the federal government and York Region.</p><p>The project will build 1.5 kilometres of new multi-use path along Yonge Street in the downtown core.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) reminds everyone to follow the laws and guidelines about approaching marine mammals, which vary depending on the species.</p><p>On May 22, 2025, in Campbell River Provincial Court, Stephen Michael White was fined $5,000 after being found guilty in November 2024 of violating Section 7(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) reminds everyone to follow the laws and guidelines about approaching marine mammals, which vary depending on the species.</p><p>On May 22, 2025, in Campbell River Provincial Court, Stephen Michael White was fined $5,000 after being found guilty in November 2024 of violating Section 7(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) reminds everyone to follow the laws and guidelines about approaching marine mammals, which vary depending on the species.</p><p>On May 22, 2025, in Campbell River Provincial Court, Stephen Michael White was fined $5,000 after being found guilty in November 2024 of violating Section 7(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water.

Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) reminds everyone to follow the laws and guidelines about approaching marine mammals, which vary depending on the species.</p><p>On May 22, 2025, in Campbell River Provincial Court, Stephen Michael White was fined $5,000 after being found guilty in November 2024 of violating Section 7(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water.

These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development. This vast, underexplored area is home to past-producing mines and significant greenfield potential, particularly for critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements. By applying AI-driven analysis to historical core samples, both governments aim to spur new investment by giving industry the tools it needs to unlock untapped mineral value - without further disturbing the land.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>1.1 Patents issued to National Research Council of Canada by the US PTO and the EPO on same inventions</p><p>In the past 24 months the following patent was issued by the USPTO and the European Patent Office (EPO) to National Research Council of Canada. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Title</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US PTO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">EPO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">A Method For Correcting Ray Distortions In Tomographic 3d Printing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20240066804; 29 Feb, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4274729; 15 Nov, 2023</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Minister Joly to give remarks at meeting hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster</p><p>The Honourable Melanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, will give remarks at a working lunch hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.

These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p>This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development. This vast, underexplored area is home to past-producing mines and significant greenfield potential, particularly for critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements. By applying AI-driven analysis to historical core samples, both governments aim to spur new investment by giving industry the tools it needs to unlock untapped mineral value - without further disturbing the land.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA: PROCUREMENT OMBUD URGES USE OF MEDIATION SERVICES TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN ADMINISTRATION OF FEDERAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS</p><p>The Office of the Procurement Ombud (OPO) released a new research study under its Knowledge Deepening and Sharing initiative, examining recurring issues related to the administration of federal construction contracts.</p><p>Over the past few years, OPO received numerous complaints from procurement stakeholders about issues related to the administration of federal construction contracts. OPO launched this research study to identify the underlying causes of these issues and to provide practical recommendations for improving contract administration practices.</p><p>Some of the common issues raised include poorly defined scopes of work, inconsistent use of standard contract documents and a lack of clarity and effectiveness of substantial performance clauses and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. These issues disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often leading to project delays, cost overruns, and disputes. Ultimately, they undermine the fairness and efficiency of federal construction projects and jeopardize the achievement of best value for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA: CANADA FUNDS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA</p><p>Canada and the Republic of Moldova share deep-rooted values.

This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace. We will defend the interests of Canadians, safeguard Canada's workers and businesses, and build one Canadian economy - the strongest economy in the G7.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>1.1 Patents issued to National Research Council of Canada by the US PTO and the EPO on same inventions</p><p>In the past 24 months the following patent was issued by the USPTO and the European Patent Office (EPO) to National Research Council of Canada. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Title</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US PTO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">EPO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">A Method For Correcting Ray Distortions In Tomographic 3d Printing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20240066804; 29 Feb, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4274729; 15 Nov, 2023</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Minister Joly to give remarks at meeting hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster</p><p>The Honourable Melanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, will give remarks at a working lunch hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster.

OPO launched this research study to identify the underlying causes of these issues and to provide practical recommendations for improving contract administration practices.</p><p>Some of the common issues raised include poorly defined scopes of work, inconsistent use of standard contract documents and a lack of clarity and effectiveness of substantial performance clauses and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. These issues disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often leading to project delays, cost overruns, and disputes. Ultimately, they undermine the fairness and efficiency of federal construction projects and jeopardize the achievement of best value for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Contract awarded for Phase 2 of Counter Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Capability in support of Operation REASSURANCE</p><p>Ottawa, Ontario, Department of National Defence</p><p>On July 7, 2025, the Government of Canada awarded two contracts for a total value of $169,187,671.90 to CACI, Inc. - FEDERAL as part of the second phase of the Counter Uncrewed Aircraft System (CUAS) Urgent Operational Requirement.

OPO launched this research study to identify the underlying causes of these issues and to provide practical recommendations for improving contract administration practices.</p><p>Some of the common issues raised include poorly defined scopes of work, inconsistent use of standard contract documents and a lack of clarity and effectiveness of substantial performance clauses and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. These issues disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often leading to project delays, cost overruns, and disputes. Ultimately, they undermine the fairness and efficiency of federal construction projects and jeopardize the achievement of best value for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Contract awarded for Phase 2 of Counter Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Capability in support of Operation REASSURANCE</p><p>Ottawa, Ontario, Department of National Defence</p><p>On July 7, 2025, the Government of Canada awarded two contracts for a total value of $169,187,671.90 to CACI, Inc. - FEDERAL as part of the second phase of the Counter Uncrewed Aircraft System (CUAS) Urgent Operational Requirement.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

OPO launched this research study to identify the underlying causes of these issues and to provide practical recommendations for improving contract administration practices.</p><p>Some of the common issues raised include poorly defined scopes of work, inconsistent use of standard contract documents and a lack of clarity and effectiveness of substantial performance clauses and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. These issues disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often leading to project delays, cost overruns, and disputes. Ultimately, they undermine the fairness and efficiency of federal construction projects and jeopardize the achievement of best value for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Contract awarded for Phase 2 of Counter Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Capability in support of Operation REASSURANCE</p><p>Ottawa, Ontario, Department of National Defence</p><p>On July 7, 2025, the Government of Canada awarded two contracts for a total value of $169,187,671.90 to CACI, Inc. - FEDERAL as part of the second phase of the Counter Uncrewed Aircraft System (CUAS) Urgent Operational Requirement.

The Tribunal's inquiry is conducted pursuant to the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA) as a result of the initiation of dumping and subsidizing investigations by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).</p><p>On September 9, 2025, the Tribunal will determine whether there is a reasonable indication that the alleged dumping and subsidizing have caused injury or retardation, or are threatening to cause injury, as these words are defined in SIMA. If so, the CBSA will continue its investigations and, by September 24, 2025, will make preliminary determinations. If these preliminary determinations indicate that there has been dumping or subsidizing, the CBSA will then continue its investigations and, concurrently, the Tribunal will initiate a final injury inquiry.</p><p>The Tribunal is an independent quasi&amp;#8209; judicial body that reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance. It hears cases on dumped and subsidized imports, safeguard complaints, complaints about federal government procurement and appeals of customs and excise tax rulings.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Massive cannabis shipment intercepted by the CBSA in Saint John</p><p>Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers in Saint John, New Brunswick (NB) recently intercepted a shipment of suspected cannabis that is the largest cannabis seizure on record since 2015.</p><p>On May 21, 2025, border services officers at the Port of Saint John, with assistance from CBSA intelligence officers in the Greater Toronto Area and Atlantic Regions, examined a marine container destined for export to Scotland, United Kingdom.</p><p>During this examination, officers uncovered over 6,700 kilograms of suspected cannabis, valued at $49.6 M. The drugs were falsely declared on the documentation provided to the CBSA and were concealed in nearly 400 boxes inside the container.</p><p>The quantity seized in this single shipment is three times more than the total amount of cannabis seized by the CBSA across Canada in the previous year.</p><p>The cannabis and all evidence were transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Eastern Region Federal Policing (New Brunswick) for further investigation.</p><p>The CBSA and the RCMP are securing our borders by collaborating on investigations to prevent illegal drug smuggling and organized crime from threatening the safety and well-being of our communities.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Federal investment supports rural transit on Galiano Island with electric minibuses</p><p>Residents on Galiano Island will benefit from new transit services following an investment of $429,453 from the federal government.</p><p>With the purchase of two electric minibuses, this funding will create the first-ever transit system for the Island.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

Starting today, until August 28, 2025, Canadians can participate in the consultations by sharing their thoughts on key issues at Canada.ca/YourBudget.</p><p>Consultations will focus on bringing down costs for Canadians - building on measures such as the middle-class tax cut which saves a two-income family up to $840 a year and removing GST on new homes under $1 million for first-time buyers. Consultations will also emphasize job-creation, including measures to build more homes, expedite nation-building projects, and bolster Canada's defence industrial capacity.</p><p>In the weeks to come, the Minister of Finance, alongside Secretary of State, Wayne Long, and Parliamentary Secretary, Ryan Turnbull, will also be meeting with stakeholders and individuals across the country as part of the pre-budget consultation process.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Dr. Rae Yeung appointed Scientific Director of CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis</p><p>Today, Dr. Paul Hebert, President of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), announced that Dr. Rae Yeung has been appointed Scientific Director of the CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis (CIHR-IMHA) for a term of four years, starting October 1, 2025.</p><p>Dr. Yeung is one of the world's leading experts on childhood inflammatory diseases.

Their leadership continues to shape a better future for all.</p><p>Together with the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, we are working to fully implement the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution Agreement, the largest land transfer in Canadian history. This means Nunavummiut will have more control over their land, water, and natural resources and benefit from development that is responsible and sustainable.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Parks Canada and British Columbia invest more than $8 M to improve ecological connectivity</p><p>Today, the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defense procurement, on behalf of the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister responsible for Parks Canada, Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture, and Minister responsible for Official Languages, announced $5.3 million in federal funding to support an agreement to advance ecological corridor projects, nature conservation and Indigenous stewardship in British Columbia. The Honourable Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, announced that the Province of British Columbia is contributing an additional $3 million, further strengthening this collaborative effort to improve ecological connectivity.</p><p>Many animals need to reach habitat well beyond the boundaries of protected areas to survive, and ecological connectivity is the movement of these wild species and the flow of natural processes through a landscape. With support from both governments, the Stewardship of Ecological Corridors in British Columbia initiative focuses on identifying, planning, and acting to improve movement through ecological corridors - linkages that connect natural habitats, including protected and conserved areas. Ecological corridors provide biodiversity and human well-being benefits and are vital for the long-term health of ecosystems.</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Federal government and East Gwillimbury partner to help residents walk a new path</p><p>East Gwillimbury will expand its active transportation network thanks to a joint investment of $7.6 million with the federal government and York Region.</p><p>The project will build 1.5 kilometres of new multi-use path along Yonge Street in the downtown core. Work will include installing wayfinding signage and beautifying the streetscape with plantings, benches and seating walls. By establishing an accessible link between the Nokiidaa Trail and the Doane Road Pedestrian Bridge, this project will provide a vibrant streetscape enhancement through the core of Holland Landing, while extending York Region's Lake-to-Lake trail network.</p><p>Walking, cycling, rolling and other methods of active transportation are healthy, convenient, affordable and sustainable ways for residents to get around. Once complete, this project will help make getting around East Gwillimbury easier and more enjoyable. It will help encourage more people to get out of their cars and onto the trails, reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Infrastructure Announcement in Peterborough</p><p>Members of the media are invited to an infrastructure announcement with the Emma Harrison Hill, Member of Parliament for Peterborough, Dave Smith, Member of Provincial Parliament for Peterborough-Kawartha, and Jeff Leal, Mayor, City of Peterborough.</p><p>Date: July 10, 2025</p><p>Time: 10:00 a.m.</p><p>Location: Board Room, 2nd floor City Hall 500 George Street North Peterborough, ON K9H 3R9</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 5037337897</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-16072518104837870001103260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8N-J693-RW53-005R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change. Budget 2025 will spend less and invest more to catalyze private capital, unleash investment, and build the strongest economy in the G7.</p><p>As the new government prepares for the tabling of Budget 2025 in the fall, the Minister of Finance and National Revenue, the Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, is launching pre-budget consultations. Starting today, until August 28, 2025, Canadians can participate in the consultations by sharing their thoughts on key issues at Canada.ca/YourBudget.</p><p>Consultations will focus on bringing down costs for Canadians - building on measures such as the middle-class tax cut which saves a two-income family up to $840 a year and removing GST on new homes under $1 million for first-time buyers. Consultations will also emphasize job-creation, including measures to build more homes, expedite nation-building projects, and bolster Canada's defence industrial capacity.</p><p>In the weeks to come, the Minister of Finance, alongside Secretary of State, Wayne Long, and Parliamentary Secretary, Ryan Turnbull, will also be meeting with stakeholders and individuals across the country as part of the pre-budget consultation process.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Dr. Rae Yeung appointed Scientific Director of CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis</p><p>Today, Dr. Paul Hebert, President of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), announced that Dr. Rae Yeung has been appointed Scientific Director of the CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis (CIHR-IMHA) for a term of four years, starting October 1, 2025.</p><p>Dr. Yeung is one of the world's leading experts on childhood inflammatory diseases.

If so, the CBSA will continue its investigations and, by September 24, 2025, will make preliminary determinations. If these preliminary determinations indicate that there has been dumping or subsidizing, the CBSA will then continue its investigations and, concurrently, the Tribunal will initiate a final injury inquiry.</p><p>The Tribunal is an independent quasi&amp;#8209; judicial body that reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

The total estimated institutional value of these seizures is $401,450.</p><p>The police have been notified and the institution is investigating.</p><p>The Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) uses a number of tools to prevent drugs from entering its institutions. These tools include ion scanners and drug-detector dogs to search buildings, personal property, inmates, and visitors.</p><p>CSC is heightening measures to prevent contraband from entering its institutions in order to help ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone. CSC also works in partnership with the police to take action against those who attempt to introduce contraband into correctional institutions.</p><p>CSC has also set up a telephone tip line for all federal institutions so that it may receive additional information about activities relating to security at CSC institutions. These activities may be related to drug use or trafficking that may threaten the safety and security of visitors, inmates, and staff members working at CSC institutions.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Tribunal Initiates Inquiry-Cast Iron Soil Pipe from China</p><p>The Canadian International Trade Tribunal today initiated a preliminary injury inquiry into a complaint by Canada Pipe Company ULC, d/b/a Bibby &amp;#8209; Ste&amp;#8209; Croix, of Sainte-Croix, Quebec, that it has suffered injury as a result of the dumping and subsidizing of cast iron soil pipe from China. The Tribunal's inquiry is conducted pursuant to the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA) as a result of the initiation of dumping and subsidizing investigations by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).</p><p>On September 9, 2025, the Tribunal will determine whether there is a reasonable indication that the alleged dumping and subsidizing have caused injury or retardation, or are threatening to cause injury, as these words are defined in SIMA. If so, the CBSA will continue its investigations and, by September 24, 2025, will make preliminary determinations. If these preliminary determinations indicate that there has been dumping or subsidizing, the CBSA will then continue its investigations and, concurrently, the Tribunal will initiate a final injury inquiry.</p><p>The Tribunal is an independent quasi&amp;#8209; judicial body that reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance. It hears cases on dumped and subsidized imports, safeguard complaints, complaints about federal government procurement and appeals of customs and excise tax rulings.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Massive cannabis shipment intercepted by the CBSA in Saint John</p><p>Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers in Saint John, New Brunswick (NB) recently intercepted a shipment of suspected cannabis that is the largest cannabis seizure on record since 2015.</p><p>On May 21, 2025, border services officers at the Port of Saint John, with assistance from CBSA intelligence officers in the Greater Toronto Area and Atlantic Regions, examined a marine container destined for export to Scotland, United Kingdom.</p><p>During this examination, officers uncovered over 6,700 kilograms of suspected cannabis, valued at $49.6 M. The drugs were falsely declared on the documentation provided to the CBSA and were concealed in nearly 400 boxes inside the container.</p><p>The quantity seized in this single shipment is three times more than the total amount of cannabis seized by the CBSA across Canada in the previous year.</p><p>The cannabis and all evidence were transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Eastern Region Federal Policing (New Brunswick) for further investigation.</p><p>The CBSA and the RCMP are securing our borders by collaborating on investigations to prevent illegal drug smuggling and organized crime from threatening the safety and well-being of our communities.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Federal investment supports rural transit on Galiano Island with electric minibuses</p><p>Residents on Galiano Island will benefit from new transit services following an investment of $429,453 from the federal government.</p><p>With the purchase of two electric minibuses, this funding will create the first-ever transit system for the Island.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change. Budget 2025 will spend less and invest more to catalyze private capital, unleash investment, and build the strongest economy in the G7.</p><p>As the new government prepares for the tabling of Budget 2025 in the fall, the Minister of Finance and National Revenue, the Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, is launching pre-budget consultations. Starting today, until August 28, 2025, Canadians can participate in the consultations by sharing their thoughts on key issues at Canada.ca/YourBudget.</p><p>Consultations will focus on bringing down costs for Canadians - building on measures such as the middle-class tax cut which saves a two-income family up to $840 a year and removing GST on new homes under $1 million for first-time buyers. Consultations will also emphasize job-creation, including measures to build more homes, expedite nation-building projects, and bolster Canada's defence industrial capacity.</p><p>In the weeks to come, the Minister of Finance, alongside Secretary of State, Wayne Long, and Parliamentary Secretary, Ryan Turnbull, will also be meeting with stakeholders and individuals across the country as part of the pre-budget consultation process.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada and the Northwest Territories Partner on Innovative, AI-Based Core Scanning Initiative to Support Critical Minerals Development</p><p>The Government of Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories are working together to advance a new geoscience research initiative that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), digital scanning technologies and historic drill cores to unlock the North's mineral potential and help solidify Canada's position as a global leader in resource development and critical minerals.</p><p>As part of this initiative, Canada and the Northwest Territories will pilot a project to scan, digitize and analyze existing drill cores from the Northwest Territories Geological Survey's collection using cutting-edge techniques to highlight new areas of high critical-mineral potential. These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p>This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development. This vast, underexplored area is home to past-producing mines and significant greenfield potential, particularly for critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements.</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Canada funds technical assistance project in the Republic of Moldova</p><p>Canada and the Republic of Moldova share deep-rooted values.

The Honourable Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, announced that the Province of British Columbia is contributing an additional $3 million, further strengthening this collaborative effort to improve ecological connectivity.</p><p>Many animals need to reach habitat well beyond the boundaries of protected areas to survive, and ecological connectivity is the movement of these wild species and the flow of natural processes through a landscape. With support from both governments, the Stewardship of Ecological Corridors in British Columbia initiative focuses on identifying, planning, and acting to improve movement through ecological corridors - linkages that connect natural habitats, including protected and conserved areas. Ecological corridors provide biodiversity and human well-being benefits and are vital for the long-term health of ecosystems.</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Federal government and East Gwillimbury partner to help residents walk a new path</p><p>East Gwillimbury will expand its active transportation network thanks to a joint investment of $7.6 million with the federal government and York Region.</p><p>The project will build 1.5 kilometres of new multi-use path along Yonge Street in the downtown core.

The Tribunal's inquiry is conducted pursuant to the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA) as a result of the initiation of dumping and subsidizing investigations by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On September 9, 2025, the Tribunal will determine whether there is a reasonable indication that the alleged dumping and subsidizing have caused injury or retardation, or are threatening to cause injury, as these words are defined in SIMA. If so, the CBSA will continue its investigations and, by September 24, 2025, will make preliminary determinations. If these preliminary determinations indicate that there has been dumping or subsidizing, the CBSA will then continue its investigations and, concurrently, the Tribunal will initiate a final injury inquiry.</p><p>The Tribunal is an independent quasi&amp;#8209;judicial body that reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance. It hears cases on dumped and subsidized imports, safeguard complaints, complaints about federal government procurement and appeals of customs and excise tax rulings.

OPO launched this research study to identify the underlying causes of these issues and to provide practical recommendations for improving contract administration practices.</p><p>Some of the common issues raised include poorly defined scopes of work, inconsistent use of standard contract documents and a lack of clarity and effectiveness of substantial performance clauses and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. These issues disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often leading to project delays, cost overruns, and disputes. Ultimately, they undermine the fairness and efficiency of federal construction projects and jeopardize the achievement of best value for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Contract awarded for Phase 2 of Counter Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Capability in support of Operation REASSURANCE</p><p>Ottawa, Ontario, Department of National Defence</p><p>On July 7, 2025, the Government of Canada awarded two contracts for a total value of $169,187,671.90 to CACI, Inc. - FEDERAL as part of the second phase of the Counter Uncrewed Aircraft System (CUAS) Urgent Operational Requirement.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

Starting today, until August 28, 2025, Canadians can participate in the consultations by sharing their thoughts on key issues at Canada.ca/YourBudget.</p><p>Consultations will focus on bringing down costs for Canadians - building on measures such as the middle-class tax cut which saves a two-income family up to $840 a year and removing GST on new homes under $1 million for first-time buyers. Consultations will also emphasize job-creation, including measures to build more homes, expedite nation-building projects, and bolster Canada's defence industrial capacity.</p><p>In the weeks to come, the Minister of Finance, alongside Secretary of State, Wayne Long, and Parliamentary Secretary, Ryan Turnbull, will also be meeting with stakeholders and individuals across the country as part of the pre-budget consultation process.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Dr. Rae Yeung appointed Scientific Director of CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis</p><p>Today, Dr. Paul Hebert, President of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), announced that Dr. Rae Yeung has been appointed Scientific Director of the CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis (CIHR-IMHA) for a term of four years, starting October 1, 2025.</p><p>Dr. Yeung is one of the world's leading experts on childhood inflammatory diseases.

The Honourable Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, announced that the Province of British Columbia is contributing an additional $3 million, further strengthening this collaborative effort to improve ecological connectivity.</p><p>Many animals need to reach habitat well beyond the boundaries of protected areas to survive, and ecological connectivity is the movement of these wild species and the flow of natural processes through a landscape. With support from both governments, the Stewardship of Ecological Corridors in British Columbia initiative focuses on identifying, planning, and acting to improve movement through ecological corridors - linkages that connect natural habitats, including protected and conserved areas. Ecological corridors provide biodiversity and human well-being benefits and are vital for the long-term health of ecosystems.</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Federal government and East Gwillimbury partner to help residents walk a new path</p><p>East Gwillimbury will expand its active transportation network thanks to a joint investment of $7.6 million with the federal government and York Region.</p><p>The project will build 1.5 kilometres of new multi-use path along Yonge Street in the downtown core.

OPO launched this research study to identify the underlying causes of these issues and to provide practical recommendations for improving contract administration practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of the common issues raised include poorly defined scopes of work, inconsistent use of standard contract documents and a lack of clarity and effectiveness of substantial performance clauses and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. These issues disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often leading to project delays, cost overruns, and disputes. Ultimately, they undermine the fairness and efficiency of federal construction projects and jeopardize the achievement of best value for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>1.1 Patents issued to National Research Council of Canada by the US PTO and the EPO on same inventions</p><p>In the past 24 months the following patent was issued by the USPTO and the European Patent Office (EPO) to National Research Council of Canada. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Title</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US PTO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">EPO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">A Method For Correcting Ray Distortions In Tomographic 3d Printing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20240066804; 29 Feb, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4274729; 15 Nov, 2023</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Minister Joly to give remarks at meeting hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster</p><p>The Honourable Melanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, will give remarks at a working lunch hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

Starting today, until August 28, 2025, Canadians can participate in the consultations by sharing their thoughts on key issues at Canada.ca/YourBudget.</p><p>Consultations will focus on bringing down costs for Canadians - building on measures such as the middle-class tax cut which saves a two-income family up to $840 a year and removing GST on new homes under $1 million for first-time buyers. Consultations will also emphasize job-creation, including measures to build more homes, expedite nation-building projects, and bolster Canada's defence industrial capacity.</p><p>In the weeks to come, the Minister of Finance, alongside Secretary of State, Wayne Long, and Parliamentary Secretary, Ryan Turnbull, will also be meeting with stakeholders and individuals across the country as part of the pre-budget consultation process.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Dr. Rae Yeung appointed Scientific Director of CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis</p><p>Today, Dr. Paul Hebert, President of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), announced that Dr. Rae Yeung has been appointed Scientific Director of the CIHR Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis (CIHR-IMHA) for a term of four years, starting October 1, 2025.</p><p>Dr. Yeung is one of the world's leading experts on childhood inflammatory diseases.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Two well-known properties remain on the market in Western Australia's South Coast region with an expected combined price tag of $15.5 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are the final land parcels to be sold by Elders Real Estate from the WALT portfolio of properties that were held by First Australian Farmland Pty Ltd in the high rainfall zones of the Great Southern, South Coast and Green Range areas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First Australian Farmland operates on behalf of the Swedish national pension fund Frsta AP-fonden.</p><p>Part of its 5595-hectare aggregation of South Coast WA properties was sold in early 2024. </p><p>These were Gidget, Range Montana and Wimbush, while the Tagliaferri and Goodhope properties are still up for grabs.</p><p>They are in the Green Range district, about 76 kilometres north east of the port city of Albany with access and frontage to the South Coast Highway in multiple locations.</p><p>This high rainfall zone averages more than 620 millimetres annually, making it well-suited to canola and cereal cropping, sheep and cattle production and agroforestry.</p><p>Tagliaferri and Goodhope have a combined area of 2543 hectares and consist of three adjoining lots.</p><p>The properties are being cropped to canola and cereals in 2025.</p><p>For livestock production they are meticulously fenced, with a good complement of robust sheep handling facilities.</p><p>These include a five-stand shearing shed, modern steel stockyards and confinement feeding facilities.</p><p>Tagliaferri and Goodhope each have a home situated on the properties.</p><p>The properties have a hub of modern infrastructure, including a large near-new shed incorporating machinery storage, chemical storage and workshop, large fertiliser and grain storage shed with loading facilities and an onsite office and grain silos</p><p>Excellent access with gravel roads and strategic laneways throughout the properties facilitate easy movement for road trains and heavy machinery.</p><p>The properties are meticulously fenced, with the majority being replaced Ringlock with iron gates and some vermin barrier boundary fencing in some locations.</p><p>There are abundant water facilities from large-scale water tanks with easy access for boom spray filling, numerous dams and some bore facilities.</p><p>The farms currently support a highly productive cropping enterprise with barley, canola and wheat sown in 2024. </p><p>In recent years, oats, triticale, vetch, serradella and clover varieties have been sown in select paddocks.</p><p>Sheep have also played a pivotal role in operations, with a focus on meat production and confinement feeding. </p><p>Sheep production infrastructure is concentrated on the Tagliaferri and Goodhope properties.</p><p>A Merino flock was acquired with the purchase of Goodhope and Tagliaferri.</p><p>In 2017, a flock of 3350 head of Mt Ronan composite ewes was also bought.</p><p>It became the basis for a self-replacing and increasing flock mated to rams sourced from Mt Ronan, Kalso and Karander studs.</p><p>To increase production intensity, sheep confinement feeding facilities were established in 2019.</p><p>In 2023, an additional 1600 Merinos were purchased to increase numbers and boost grazing pressure on Goodhope and Tagliaferri, where more than 8500 ewes were concentrated.</p><p>Following the decision to sell the WALT Portfolio, the process of destocking the properties has started.</p><p>Soils on Tagliaferri and Goodhope are typical of the Green Range area, consisting of mostly sands over gravel, sands over clay and gravelly sandplain.</p><p>These properties have mostly undulating paddocks, with the average slope of the whole aggregation estimated to be 1.8 degrees, ranging from 0 to 15.3 degrees. </p><p>The average elevation over the whole WALT aggregation is estimated to be 141.1 metres above sea level.</p><p>The Tagliaferri and Goodhope farms benefit from being within a mild climatic zone, in close proximity to the South Coast and have minimal frost events or days above 35 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Water is supplied via a combination of farm dams, bores and rainwater tanks.</p><p>There are three bores, one equipped with solar panels and a pump, one equipped with an electric pump and the third capped. </p><p>There are two large rainwater tanks, each with 275,000-litre capacity, located on Goodhope.</p><p>There are additional concrete and poly tanks strategically located over the two properties, as well as several dams.</p><p>Improvements on the Tagliaferri property include a 280 square metre machinery shed with partial concrete floor and a 185m2 machinery shed with an earth floor.</p><p>Goodhope has a 180m2 machinery shed with an earth floor and a 110m2 machinery shed with an earth floor.</p><p>Tagliaferri has about 152 tonnes of grain storage capacity with two Moylan grain silos.</p><p>The homestead on this property has brick cladding and a metal roof, with three bedrooms, one bathroom, a kitchen, dining, lounge and laundry.</p><p>The Goodhope homestead is a brick cladding and metal roof dwelling with three bedrooms, one bathroom, a kitchen, dining, lounge and laundry.</p><p>Ringlock fencing comprises a mixture of steel and timber posts and double iron gates throughout.</p><p>Vermin barrier fencing is in place along sections of the boundary. </p><p>The property is internally subdivided into 11 main paddocks and is generally in sound condition.</p><p>Tagliaferri comprises lower-lying areas situated on the northern side of the property, transitioning to undulating land towards the southern portion.</p><p>Vegetation includes original timbers of tea tree, red gum, stunted jarrah and sheoak, with some areas of introduced bluegum trees which have been strategically left on the property as shelterbelts.</p><p>Fencing on Goodhope is Ringlock comprising a mixture of steel and timber posts and double iron gates thoughout.</p><p>There is vermin barrier fencing along sections of the boundary and the property is internally subdivided into 29 main paddocks, mostly in sound condition.</p><p>Harvesting of the last remaining blue gum plantation on the property is in the final stages and is to be completed prior to settlement.</p><p>Goodhope comprises a low-lying area situated to the northern side of the property, transitioning to steep land to the south and eastern portions of the holding. </p><p>The southern portion of the property is the most elevated, with aspects over surrounding rural land and the Southern Ocean.</p><p>Vegetation includes original timbers comprising tea tree, red gum, jarrah and sheoak, with some areas of introduced bluegum trees, which have been strategically left on the property as shelterbelts.</p><p>More

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

The data reported also shows the discovery of child labour is down in the sector. </p><p>On other measures, the sector is less commendable. Deforestation is still high, with more than a third of cocoa bought by companies coming from deforested or unknown sources. </p><p>Companies reported that 84% of cocoa farmers in their supply chain are not earning a living income - or their income is unknown.

Following the training, these smallholders formed a smallholder's association, Labuhanbatu Independent Oil Palm Smallholders Association (APSKS LB), North Sumatra. Musim Mas encourages smallholders to form associations to get better access to resources and obtain certification by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO).</p><p>\"Musim Mas has long saw that smallholders are\u00a0key to achieving palm oil sustainability, and that's why we lead Indonesia's most extensive smallholder program. We believe that the way forward is to collaborate with more partners to achieve a\u00a0wider impact. With our BIPOSC partners, we hope to advance the skills and knowledge of smallholders through regenerative agriculture and related techniques. Regenerative agriculture and agroforestry have the potential to help smallholders be part of a sustainable palm oil supply chain. It could help them develop alternative sources of income, especially during the replanting period where their palm oil crops are unproductive, typically for three years,\" said Rob Nicholls, General Manager, Projects &amp; Programs, Musim Mas Group.</p><p>In the face of climate change and threatened biodiversity, regenerative agriculture can play a role for small farms because it maintains soil health, prevents erosion and\u00a0water runoff, and can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen leakage.</p><p>\"As a global development partner organization, SNV aims to support Indonesia in achieving its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve this, we need to implement effective and impactful programs to transform agricultural and food systems, energy, and water. In the BIPOSC program, we promote a comprehensive regenerative agriculture and agroforestry model to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity, providing maximum benefits for farmers' livelihoods and economy,\" said Rizki Pandu Permana, Country Director of SNV Indonesia.</p><p>The key regenerative agriculture techniques taught include the application of bio-input, mulching to protect topsoil, planting cover crops, integrated pest management that reduces the need for chemical pesticides, and application of compost that reduces the amount of chemical fertilizers needed. To date, 1,032 independent smallholders received training and implement these techniques on their farms, representing a total land with a total area of 1,063.68 hectares. The project trained 25 village facilitators to provide hands-on assistance to smallholders, and seven demo plots established as pilot areas and learning facilities for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"When I visited palm oil smallholders a few years ago in the area, their biggest concern was access to more fertilizers. While fertilizers play a key role in boosting yields, there was a noticeable gap in understanding how to protect the soil from long-term degradation. Smallholders needed more knowledge about maintaining soil health, preserving soil structure, and other critical factors. This is exactly what the BIPOSC project aimed to address, and we're pleased to see that the farmers involved are now reporting not only higher yields but also healthier soils on their plots,\" said Bernard Giraud, President &amp; Co-Founder, Livelihoods.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBTSRW-202410212051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBTSRW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D7C-M5Y1-DXKH-N4S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Following the training, these smallholders formed a smallholder's association, Labuhanbatu Independent Oil Palm Smallholders Association (APSKS LB), North Sumatra. Musim Mas encourages smallholders to form associations to get better access to resources and obtain certification by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO).</p><p>\"Musim Mas has long saw that smallholders are\u00a0key to achieving palm oil sustainability, and that's why we lead Indonesia's most extensive smallholder program. We believe that the way forward is to collaborate with more partners to achieve a\u00a0wider impact. With our BIPOSC partners, we hope to advance the skills and knowledge of smallholders through regenerative agriculture and related techniques. Regenerative agriculture and agroforestry have the potential to help smallholders be part of a sustainable palm oil supply chain. It could help them develop alternative sources of income, especially during the replanting period where their palm oil crops are unproductive, typically for three years,\" said Rob Nicholls, General Manager, Projects &amp; Programs, Musim Mas Group.</p><p>In the face of climate change and threatened biodiversity, regenerative agriculture can play a role for small farms because it maintains soil health, prevents erosion and\u00a0water runoff, and can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen leakage.</p><p>\"As a global development partner organization, SNV aims to support Indonesia in achieving its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve this, we need to implement effective and impactful programs to transform agricultural and food systems, energy, and water. In the BIPOSC program, we promote a comprehensive regenerative agriculture and agroforestry model to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity, providing maximum benefits for farmers' livelihoods and economy,\" said Rizki Pandu Permana, Country Director of SNV Indonesia.</p><p>The key regenerative agriculture techniques taught include the application of bio-input, mulching to protect topsoil, planting cover crops, integrated pest management that reduces the need for chemical pesticides, and application of compost that reduces the amount of chemical fertilizers needed. To date, 1,032 independent smallholders received training and implement these techniques on their farms, representing a total land with a total area of 1,063.68 hectares. The project trained 25 village facilitators to provide hands-on assistance to smallholders, and seven demo plots established as pilot areas and learning facilities for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"When I visited palm oil smallholders a few years ago in the area, their biggest concern was access to more fertilizers. While fertilizers play a key role in boosting yields, there was a noticeable gap in understanding how to protect the soil from long-term degradation. Smallholders needed more knowledge about maintaining soil health, preserving soil structure, and other critical factors. This is exactly what the BIPOSC project aimed to address, and we're pleased to see that the farmers involved are now reporting not only higher yields but also healthier soils on their plots,\" said Bernard Giraud, President &amp; Co-Founder, Livelihoods.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBTSRW-202410212052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBTSRW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D7C-M5Y1-DXKH-N4S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

For instance, Labor Treasurer Jim Chalmers approved $507,000 to redesign the $5 note. Similarly, federal Labor spent $620,000 over two years for a speechwriter for minister Bill Shorten, despite Services Australia (his department) having over 180 communications staff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whilst each expenditure may have its justification, in an environment of record debt and extreme cost-of-living pressures, such spending is irresponsible. In 1942, Sir Robert Menzies observed, \"The great vice of democracy is that for a generation we have been busy getting ourselves on to the list of beneficiaries and removing ourselves from the list of contributors.\" Regrettably, this observation seems more pertinent today than ever.</p><p>It's time for our government to focus on delivering core functions and abandon unnecessary, boutique projects, especially those ideologically driven. Taxpayer money isn't limitless; it's a finite resource that must be managed with care and respect.</p><p>Tim Traill Sandy Bay</p><p>Needless wand worries There has been opposition to police being given wands that will react to persons carrying a knife. The opposition is that police will use this detection method indiscriminately or target people. Guidelines are in place that the wand can only be used in designated areas or in an area where a knife has been used before.</p><p>Police carry capsicum spray and guns but only use them under certain circumstances. It will be the same with the wand. Also it is an unobtrusive search method rather than a physical search.</p><p>The only ones who should be concerned are those in the community who are carrying knives or any weapon for that matter. I have no problems with police being dedicated and diligent in their approach to suspicious activity, it will only mean that there will be safety for the wider community.</p><p>Alan Leitch Austins Ferry</p><p>Not anti-jobs, pro-future After raising concerns about fish farms releasing antibiotics into our inshore waters, I was told: \"You just want to destroy forestry and aquaculture.\" That's not true - and it misses the bigger picture.</p><p>Everyone understands the need for jobs, but we need a better balance between jobs, profits, and protecting our environment. Right now, we have large profits going offshore, around 3500 local jobs, and an ecological time-bomb with cost implications for all Tasmanians.</p><p>Fish farms are polluting our waters, fuelling antibiotic resistance, and leaving marine debris. Native forest logging is accelerating climate change and pushing species to extinction. Both industries are contributing to Australia's wider biodiversity crisis.</p><p>But there are alternatives: seaweed and shellfish farming, onshore barramundi aquaponics, engineered timber from plantation species, and agroforestry. We could re-tool sawmills, support innovation, educate our kids to a high standard, and build a university-based tech hub.</p><p>Expressing concerns about industry practices isn't anti-jobs, it's pro-future. Other countries with fewer natural resources are doing this already. We just need the political will to invest in smarter, more sustainable options.</p><p>Jenny Cambers-Smith Crabtree</p><p>Make it better, Greens Growing fish in floating cages represents the pinnacle of humanity's transition from hunting and gathering to \"agriculture\". At 360 million square kilometers, the oceans are the ultimate pasture. With automated feeding, no bycatch, no threat to other species, and natural waste disposal, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Plenty - if done poorly. Overcrowding driven by greed, reluctance to build offshore cages for deeper waters, and poor design due to inadequate research could all pose risks. But the greatest threat isn't from within the industry; it's from relentless Green opposition.</p><p>Instead of working to improve this promising and successful sector, they seem intent on shutting it down, undermining the investment needed for progress.</p><p>The Greens must recognise the urgent need for affordable, healthy, and sustainable protein. Rather than campaigning against fish farming, they should focus on making it better.</p><p>Richard McCure Sandy Bay</p><p>Hospital stuck in past Reading David O'Byrne's tabling of Hospital South \"non-standard food items\" in parliament (Mercury, April 9), regarding written permission required for comfort foods such as an icy pole, reminded me of visiting someone in the RHH K Block on Tuesday around 2pm.</p><p>The whiteboard still had the previous days date and duty nurse written up and the wall clock was still on daylight saving time.</p><p>When I mentioned the clock to a nurse, I received little more than a shrug. Staff are under the pump, and this is small insignificant stuff I know. I guess the clock can only be adjusted by a suitably qualified and certified maintenance person, as reaching up and removing the clock from the wall could land the nurse in hospital.</p><p>I had to physically restrain myself from walking over and adjusting the clock. But one wonders what bigger things are missed behind the scenes? Paul Merhulik Blackmans Bay</p><p>Questionable approval The projected redevelopment of the defunct Mary's Grange home appears to be quite improper for the site, according to Kingborough Council's own definitions of zoning requirements. We are told that the approval was given by an \"external consultant\" on his own, without the involvement of any council officers.</p><p>If this is so, the Mayor of Kingborough must be guilty of dereliction of duty, at the very least!</p><p>John Solomon Taroona</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-3ddbb55814d211f0be12d435849184410252ef685eecf9d1d0d0c3ef0d21c990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHY-9KS3-RS0H-D0XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 10, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008WYU</classCode><className>COST OF LIVING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Businesses across Asia are treading warily as they deal with a fragmented and complex B2B payment landscape. While some companies are cautiously optimistic about future sales and profits, others are fearful about cash flow problems and a deterioration in B2B customer payment behaviour. A significant 50% of firms also believe there will be a rise in customer insolvencies in the months ahead, posing a clear threat to financial health.</p><p>Our latest survey, conducted during the second half of Q2 2025, thus reveals an underlying fragility among companies in Asia amid widespread unease about how global trade policy uncertainties will impact on domestic economies. There is a remarkable mix of opinion across all the indicators, including an almost even split between firms experiencing stable, improved or worsening payment behaviour. The strain on business cash flow is highlighted by an average 44% of all B2B credit sales being affected by late payments. Bad debts average 5% of B2B invoices, but this figure masks vastly fluctuating rates among the various markets and the consequent serious threat to profitability.</p><p>Trade credit continues to play a central role in B2B trade across Asia, however, reflected in the survey finding that 54% of all B2B sales are currently transacted on credit. This is clearly a strategy to encourage sales and promote customer loyalty, but does mean increased credit exposure only partially mitigated by steady payment terms.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 2 of 2 Jul 14, 2025:</p><p>ARCADIA HOTEL NECKARSULM: TRADE CREDIT AND SURETY INSURANCES REINFORCE THEIR ROLE</p><p>According to the International Credit Insurance &amp; Surety Association (ICISA), trade credit insurance covered commercial credit lines grew by 7.5% in 2024, reaching EUR 3.5 trillion and supporting global trade at record levels.

On Friday, however, traders will take at least a brief pause from the weather trade to see what USDA has to say regarding corn fundamentals.</p><p>For Friday's report, the Dow Jones pre-report survey shows the average guess among analysts to be 1.342 billion bushels (bb) of carryout for the 2024-25 season. In fact, 10 of the 15 analysts included in the survey are predicting USDA to cut the old-crop carryout. If this cut occurs, increased exports are very likely to be the driver, as corn shipments through the last full week of June are running 27% ahead of the same time in 2024, with USDA currently estimating a 16% increase. Another 25- to 50-million-bushel (mb) increase may be appropriate, but I believe USDA will be cautious here given the seasonal tendency for exports to slow ahead of harvest.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 2 of 24 Jul 09, 2025:</p><p>ALGONA LIVESTOCK AUCTION: USDA DISASTER AID DETAILS RELEASED</p><p>Crop farmers who suffered losses due to natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 can now apply for $16 billion in assistance through the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP), USDA stated Wednesday.</p><p>Funding for the program was passed by Congress in December as part of a $31.78 billion overall package that earmarked $10 billion for economic assistance and $21.78 billion for natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>To expedite the implementation of SDRP, USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) is delivering assistance in two stages, the agency stated.

One underappreciated source of resistant bacteria is our wastewater, as bacteria in sewage evolve to survive small doses of antibiotics excreted by patients. Without proper treatment, these resistant bacteria could get into our water resources and cause infections, or transfer genes for antibiotic resistance to other bacteria. Scientists experimenting with natural compounds as potential water treatments have discovered that extracts of turmeric and rhubarb, curcumin and emodin, inhibit the activity of some strains of these resistant bacteria.

These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p>This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development. This vast, underexplored area is home to past-producing mines and significant greenfield potential, particularly for critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements. By applying AI-driven analysis to historical core samples, both governments aim to spur new investment by giving industry the tools it needs to unlock untapped mineral value - without further disturbing the land.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 14 of 20 Jul 14, 2025:</p><p>NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA: DR.

Briefly, what did you see there?</p><p>Well, it was interesting how tolerant so many people were there to being so tightly regulated. So there they have rules around loss limits, which means every person who gambles in Norway can only lose a certain amount of money every month. It comes to about $2,000 per month. There's also limits on how long you can play, how many hours you can play per month. There are limits on the kinds of games that you can play, and they have no casinos there. So, it's all online or it's in kiosks and in some sort of slot machines that they have at convenience stores. So there's just a lot of rules. And one thing that I think is very important is that the government owns the entire gambling industry or almost the entire gambling industry.

It is a bit of an investment of work up front, but mulch serves important purposes beyond just making the garden look tidy.</p><p>Mulch helps conserve soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and - if you use organic mulch - adds soil nutrients.</p><p>Diseases are less likely to get a foothold if you use mulch. It helps keep soil off of plants and fruit during heavy rains. Fungi, bacteria, and nematodes in the soil can infect plants, leading to issues like damping-off and root rot.</p><p>All mulches serve the same basic function, so which mulch you choose depends on the types of plants you grow as well as on your own aesthetic tastes.</p><p>For annual and perennial gardens, organic mulches are best. These include bark mulch, wood chips, shredded leaves, or pine needles. Skip the landscape fabric - it's a maintenance headache.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 14 of 23 Jul 11, 2025:</p><p>NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC RADIO, INC.

We gave the ball (away) in areas where they transitioned very well and we had a difficult time getting pressure on the ball. I think that was probably the biggest issue in the first half was getting pressure on the ball. We started in a 4-2-3-1 and we had a way in which we wanted to go pressure them and it didn't work. We made an adjustment halfway through the second half, trying to put Manu (Garcia) a little bit closer to Dejan (Joveljic) in more of a 4-4-2. We tried a few different things and it just wasn't working. We were giving the ball away and then we got stretched and they were getting at us. (Jordan) Morris' run for the first goal, we've seen that time and time again and that was something that we were aware of and unfortunately he got to the spot first. That set everything else in motion. After it was 2-0, I think we started to put a little bit more pressure but then a dagger right before half in transition by giving the ball away - which you will from time to time in the box taking chances - and they transitioned right down the field and they scored. So we had almost an insurmountable deficit to overcome. But, as you said, we did come back in the second half. We made significant adjustments in the second half, in which we got close. But on the day, the first half did us in.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 6 of 12 Jul 13, 2025:</p><p>SPORTING KANSAS CITY CRONICA DEL PARTIDO: SPORTING KANSAS CITY CAE 2-3 CONTRA LOS SEATTLE SOUNDERS</p><p>En un partido donde Sporting se encontro atras tres goles en el primer tiempo, Kansas City pudo anotar dos goles en la segunda mitad para acortar la ventaja.

Cheese, a Panda Express, a Jollibee Chicken, and the din of traffic from U.S. Highway 22 all pressing in from the west, north, and east. Only the presence of a meandering branch of the Rahway River to the south has prevented a complete encirclement. Hostovsky's grave plaque, one of twenty-two thousand located there, is a modest one, in keeping with the cemetery's park-like aesthetic, as well as the age-old Jewish conviction that everyone rots equally. \"Life is known to be very difficult and very complicated,\" Sigmund Freud once wrote his friend Wilhelm Fliess, \"and, as we say in Vienna, many roads lead to the Central Cemetery.\" Set against a solid granite base is a flat bronze marker, decorated with two Magen Davids and an inscription providing only the barest outline of Hostovsky's remarkable life - Egon Hostovsky, April 23, 1908 - May 7, 1973.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 10 of 20 Jul 09, 2025:</p><p>THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR A GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC SCANDAL IS BREWING: WHAT IF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS NO LONGER TRUSTWORTHY?</p><p>Every day, the press churns out shocking scientific news that contradicts what we've always believed, our trusted doctors, or plain common sense.

The dumber the methodology, the harder it is to verify if the researchers even exist. The more groundbreaking the result, the more likely its interpretation is bogus. The more clicks a story gets, the less fact-checking the journalist did. And the more institutions and media outlets amplify and rework the story, the more dangerous the headline becomes.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

It achieves this by growing a diverse range of fruits, nuts, vegetables, timber, and livestock in the same production area. This process promotes biodiversity, which is crucial for maintaining soil quality and producing nutritious food, as well as preserving and rebuilding ecosystems often destroyed by other farming methods.</p><p>\"ForestFoods' partnership with Tatu City aligns perfectly with our vision of harmonious coexistence between sustainable urban development and nature,\" said Perminas Marisi, Head of City Management at Tatu City. \"We are delighted that residents, schools and businesses in Tatu City and the region can now access nutrient-dense and beyond-organic farm produce at their doorstep.\"</p><p>ForestFoods and Tatu City announced their partnership against the backdrop of the historic Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi on 4-6 September 2023, convened by H.E. President William Samoei Ruto. ForestFoods' location at the heart of Tatu City compliments the city's 100,000-strong tree nursery and large-scale reforestation plans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBTSRW-202309042045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBTSRW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:693H-2P81-JD2R-K0DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 News Bites Pty Ltd.
