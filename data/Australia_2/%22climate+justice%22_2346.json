Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Training that goes beyond traditional law enforcement is becoming essential. Research shows crisis intervention programs improve officer confidence, reduce use of force, and lead to better diversion into treatment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, Eastern Michigan University and the Ann Arbor Police Department (AAPD) have developed a first-of-its-kind interactive training program that blends theater and law enforcement to improve officers' responses to mental health crises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMU social work professor Barbara Walters and AAPD community engagement officer Kasey Whitford laid the groundwork for AAPD's new interactive crisis prevention training. \"I thought it would be cool to use theatre students instead of other officers, because with trained actors, the scenarios feel more real,\" said Whitford.</p><p>The training included simulated encounters, such as responding to individuals in psychiatric distress or experiencing behavioral health crises. Officers participated in these roleplays in real-time, practicing de-escalation strategies, communication techniques, and trauma-informed responses.</p><p>The project was guided by EMU professors Walters and Jessica (Decky) Alexander, who saw an opportunity to connect graduate students Dan Johnson and Adam Weisman to the police department because of their expertise in providing education through performance.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 18: Eastern Michigan University: Ottobocks Full Circle Movement partners with Eastern Michigan University to empower the community through movement</p><p>Ottobock North America, a global leader in prosthetics and orthotics, is proud to bring its signature Full Circle Movement event to Ypsilanti in collaboration with Eastern Michigan University's Orthotics and Prosthetics program.

The event is open to participants of all ages and mobility levels to experience the power of movement in a supportive, high-energy environment.</p><p>The Full Circle Movement invites participants to engage in community movement tailored for prosthesis users and individuals with limb loss or limb difference. Led by certified clinicians and Paralympic-level experts, the event fosters confidence and connection through movement. It also provides a hands-on opportunity for orthotics and prosthetics students and professionals to witness how mobility solutions come to life beyond the clinic.</p><p>\"At Ottobock, we believe movement is for everyone,\" said Lucas Crisanti, clinical specialist and coach at Ottobock North America. \"Partnering with Eastern allows us to reach future O&amp;P leaders while empowering the limb loss and limb difference community through Full Circle Movement.

Led by assistant director Zachary Krauss, EMU student assistants, and interns, the STEM outreach team has brought hydrology, meteorology, and engineering concepts to life in innovative and accessible ways.</p><p>\"This year's success proves what happens when education and industry come together with a shared mission,\" said Krauss. \"We've seen students light up during hands-on activities and helped teachers build meaningful STEM connections for their classrooms.\"</p><p>Over the summer, the initiative brought together more than 30 teachers and administrators from YCS, LCS, and the Washtenaw Intermediate School District for a two-day teachers workshop at Toyota's Saline research and development facility.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

John Koolage, department head of history and philosophy. \"Dr. Whyte's work in spaces where knowledge production modes come into contact is of great interest to the philosophers at EMU. In addition, his experience and areas of expertise will be of significant benefit to our learners from our intro classes to our master's students.\"</p><p>Drawing on his educational expertise as a foundation for his residency, Whyte's mission is to employ a cross-functional approach that fosters meaningful collaboration across disciplines to support Indigenous rights and sustainable futures. A key aspect of the activities will be demonstrating how partnership between the humanities, arts, and STEM is a necessary condition for research and educational advocacy of Indigenous peoples' rights and knowledge.</p><p>Throughout his professorship, Whyte will deliver free public lectures at EMU on Sept.</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University students explore Michigan's unique plant communities in immersive field class</p><p>Students in Eastern Michigan University's Plant Communities of Michigan summer field course are trading traditional classrooms for some of the state's most ecologically rich landscapes. Over three intensive weekends, they've trekked through prairie fens, wetlands, and undisturbed natural areas, gaining firsthand experience with Michigan's diverse ecosystems.</p><p>Led by Lecturer Jennifer Harper, the hybrid course blends lectures with extensive fieldwork at the University of Michigan Biological Station and EMU's Fish Lake site. Students analyze plant communities, comparing expected ecological profiles with real-world observations and assessing how physical conditions shape species composition and geographic distribution.</p><p>\"This is a very field-immersive course,\" Harper explained. \"Students take ownership of a community, prepare reports on what they expect to see, and then evaluate how closely their field notes match those expectations. It's about engaging with natural communities that are as undisturbed as possible.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 10: Eastern Michigan University: EMU statement in response to media inquiries: Ohio marketing</p><p>Eastern Michigan University continues to extend in-state tuition opportunities to students across the country, including Ohio, as part of a broader effort to make higher education more affordable and accessible. Students in Ohio have benefited from this offering for decades under a 1980 reciprocity agreement between the Michigan State Board of Education and the Ohio Board of Regents.</p><p>EMU's outreach to Ohio students is rooted in regional proximity and shared academic opportunity. Located less than an hour from northwest Ohio, the University has maintained consistent enrollment marketing to the region for many years, just as Ohio institutions regularly engage students in southeast Michigan.</p><p>The University's \"All Are Welcome Here\" message, introduced in 2017, underscores EMU's deeply held commitment to inclusion, access, and student success. This guiding philosophy encourages individuals from all backgrounds to explore their potential, pursue meaningful degrees, and prepare for impactful careers in communities across the country.</p><p>This commitment is vividly captured in these ads, which showcase the university's inclusive spirit and student-centered environment:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca</url> Ltls</p><p>Our priority is supporting students in finding their purpose and launching meaningful careers.</p><p>June 30: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan Universitys Baja racing team ranks second-fastest in Michigan, making history at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers 2025 competition</p><p>Eastern Michigan University's Baja Racing Club made a bold return to competition this year, charging into the record books with a breakthrough performance. Earning the title of second-fastest four-wheel drive motorsport vehicle in Michigan and 66th place overall at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 2025 competition in Mechanicsville, Maryland, this marks the first time the team has officially qualified to compete, making their placement a defining milestone for EMU's engineering and motorsports legacy.</p><p>\"Our placement in Maryland means everything to me,\" said Travis Kurth, an electrical and computer engineering senior and the club's vice president. \"Not only does it emphasize EMU's exceptional engineering school, but it also reflects years of effort from dedicated students who took time out of their busy semesters to work together toward a common goal. It shows the hours of meetings, designing, and manufacturing needed to build a vehicle like this.\"</p><p>During the 2023-24 academic year, the racing club prepared its Baja car to make an impression at the nationally acclaimed Williamsport competition in Pennsylvania last May. However, after passing multiple rounds built to test different areas of the car, the team was unable to complete the final inspection.</p><p>This year, the team was determined to reach the starting line with a new and improved \"Eagle I\", a vehicle they'd been tinkering with since 2021.</p><p>June 26: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan University names Amy Hietapelto as dean of the College of Business</p><p>Eastern Michigan University has appointed Amy Hietapelto as the dean of the College of Business, effective July 16.

In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

A key aspect of the activities will be demonstrating how partnership between the humanities, arts, and STEM is a necessary condition for research and educational advocacy of Indigenous peoples' rights and knowledge.</p><p>Throughout his professorship, Whyte will deliver free public lectures at EMU on Sept.</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University students explore Michigan's unique plant communities in immersive field class</p><p>Students in Eastern Michigan University's Plant Communities of Michigan summer field course are trading traditional classrooms for some of the state's most ecologically rich landscapes. Over three intensive weekends, they've trekked through prairie fens, wetlands, and undisturbed natural areas, gaining firsthand experience with Michigan's diverse ecosystems.</p><p>Led by Lecturer Jennifer Harper, the hybrid course blends lectures with extensive fieldwork at the University of Michigan Biological Station and EMU's Fish Lake site. Students analyze plant communities, comparing expected ecological profiles with real-world observations and assessing how physical conditions shape species composition and geographic distribution.</p><p>\"This is a very field-immersive course,\" Harper explained. \"Students take ownership of a community, prepare reports on what they expect to see, and then evaluate how closely their field notes match those expectations. It's about engaging with natural communities that are as undisturbed as possible.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 10: Eastern Michigan University: EMU statement in response to media inquiries: Ohio marketing</p><p>Eastern Michigan University continues to extend in-state tuition opportunities to students across the country, including Ohio, as part of a broader effort to make higher education more affordable and accessible. Students in Ohio have benefited from this offering for decades under a 1980 reciprocity agreement between the Michigan State Board of Education and the Ohio Board of Regents.</p><p>EMU's outreach to Ohio students is rooted in regional proximity and shared academic opportunity. Located less than an hour from northwest Ohio, the University has maintained consistent enrollment marketing to the region for many years, just as Ohio institutions regularly engage students in southeast Michigan.</p><p>The University's \"All Are Welcome Here\" message, introduced in 2017, underscores EMU's deeply held commitment to inclusion, access, and student success. This guiding philosophy encourages individuals from all backgrounds to explore their potential, pursue meaningful degrees, and prepare for impactful careers in communities across the country.</p><p>This commitment is vividly captured in these ads, which showcase the university's inclusive spirit and student-centered environment:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca</url> Ltls</p><p>Our priority is supporting students in finding their purpose and launching meaningful careers.</p><p>June 30: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan Universitys Baja racing team ranks second-fastest in Michigan, making history at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers 2025 competition</p><p>Eastern Michigan University's Baja Racing Club made a bold return to competition this year, charging into the record books with a breakthrough performance. Earning the title of second-fastest four-wheel drive motorsport vehicle in Michigan and 66th place overall at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 2025 competition in Mechanicsville, Maryland, this marks the first time the team has officially qualified to compete, making their placement a defining milestone for EMU's engineering and motorsports legacy.</p><p>\"Our placement in Maryland means everything to me,\" said Travis Kurth, an electrical and computer engineering senior and the club's vice president. \"Not only does it emphasize EMU's exceptional engineering school, but it also reflects years of effort from dedicated students who took time out of their busy semesters to work together toward a common goal. It shows the hours of meetings, designing, and manufacturing needed to build a vehicle like this.\"</p><p>During the 2023-24 academic year, the racing club prepared its Baja car to make an impression at the nationally acclaimed Williamsport competition in Pennsylvania last May. However, after passing multiple rounds built to test different areas of the car, the team was unable to complete the final inspection.</p><p>This year, the team was determined to reach the starting line with a new and improved \"Eagle I\", a vehicle they'd been tinkering with since 2021.</p><p>June 26: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan University names Amy Hietapelto as dean of the College of Business</p><p>Eastern Michigan University has appointed Amy Hietapelto as the dean of the College of Business, effective July 16. Hietapelto brings more than 20 years of progressive leadership experience in higher education and joins EMU from the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD), where she most recently served as dean of the Labovitz School of Business and Economics.</p><p>Hietapelto's career spans multiple leadership roles, including interim executive vice chancellor for Academic Affairs at UMD, overseeing several academic units. She has also held positions as dean and full professor at Northeastern Illinois University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution in Chicago, and Michigan Technological University.</p><p>\"Dr. Hietapelto's extensive background in academic leadership, strategic planning, and student success makes her an ideal choice to lead EMU's College of Business,\" said Rhonda Longworth, provost and executive vice president for Academic and Student Affairs. \"Her leadership will be key as we continue to grow our business programs, enhance academic opportunities, and strengthen the college's regional and national impact.\"</p><p>Hietapelto has a track record of partnering with faculty, staff and external stakeholders to provide an inclusive educational experience for students, building bridges with the community and effecting positive change.</p><p>\"During a time of significant challenges and opportunities for higher education, I am excited to continue that work at Eastern Michigan University,\" said Hietapelto.</p><p>PermID: 4298365701</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-19082518173837890001104686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHX-JG03-RTGB-93JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

This free, inclusive event will take place on Saturday, Sept. 27, from noon to 5 p.m. at the Olds/Marshall/Parks Outdoor Track, located at 100 Westview St. in Ypsilanti. The event is open to participants of all ages and mobility levels to experience the power of movement in a supportive, high-energy environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Full Circle Movement invites participants to engage in community movement tailored for prosthesis users and individuals with limb loss or limb difference. Led by certified clinicians and Paralympic-level experts, the event fosters confidence and connection through movement. It also provides a hands-on opportunity for orthotics and prosthetics students and professionals to witness how mobility solutions come to life beyond the clinic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At Ottobock, we believe movement is for everyone,\" said Lucas Crisanti, clinical specialist and coach at Ottobock North America. \"Partnering with Eastern allows us to reach future O&amp;P leaders while empowering the limb loss and limb difference community through Full Circle Movement. It's about building bridges between education, innovation, and inclusion.\"</p><p>To further amplify the educational impact of the weekend, Ottobock will also host a continuing education course, \"The Athlete's Corner,\" on Friday, Sept. 26, at EMU's Student Center. Designed for practicing clinicians, the course offers three continuing education credits and features hands-on training with a live patient model. Attendees will explore strategies for improving design, alignment, fit, performance, and outcomes for patients using running prostheses, equipping them with actionable insights to support users in and out of the clinic.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 13: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan University President James Smith and Connie Ruhl-Smith receive Public Media Impact Award from Michigan Association of Broadcasters</p><p>The Michigan Association of Broadcasters (MAB) honored Eastern Michigan University President James Smith and Connie Ruhl-Smith with the Public Media Impact Award during its Summer Leadership Conference on Aug. 12 in Traverse City.</p><p>The Public Media Impact Award is one of the MAB's highest honors, presented annually to two recipients-one professional and one donor-in recognition of their outstanding contributions to public broadcasting in Michigan.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

Switzerland said no one could have linked emissions to rising temperatures before scientific studies in that decade.</p><p>Rubbish, say climate-vulnerable countries, who point to research in developed nations as early as the 1960s.</p><p>This could have an impact on when potential reparations kick in.</p><p>The concept of \"intergenerational equity\" is another fundamental demand of the young climate justice campaigners who helped bring this case to the world's highest court.</p><p>\"The impact of climate change is not bounded by time,\" argued Namibia, with the worst effects hitting people decades or maybe centuries later.</p><p>But developed countries counter that the rights of as-yet-unborn people have no force in international law.</p><p>\"Human beings alive now cannot claim rights on behalf of future generations,\" argued Germany.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/icj-climate-ruling-five-things-watch-1859767\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXTA-IBTX13285701K0TF9T0BMAM05MMX1KQ1AEE4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB4-75G3-S19T-32T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><timeReceived>1:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPENSOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPENSOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Employing over 800 people across 37 countries, it manages a $25 billion endowment, granting $1.5 billion annually to support justice, education, and media. In 2024, OSF expanded public health initiatives in Africa. Its culture emphasizes human rights, diversity, and transparency, with training in advocacy and policy. Competing with Ford Foundation, OSF stands out for its civil society focus. Recent initiatives include AI governance grants and climate justice programs, aligning with global trends. OSFs move to Berlin from Budapest in 2018 reflects its adaptability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS [3 Press Releases]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   OPEN SOCIETY PRESIDENT BINAIFER NOWROJEE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN AMERICA'S ROLE IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE</p><p>MEXICO CITY-In a special lecture delivered at the National Museum of Anthropology, Binaifer Nowrojee, President of the Open Society Foundations, highlighted Latin America's role as a leader of bold social transformation in an era of global crisis.</p><p>Her lecture, \"Standing for What's Right in a World Gone Wrong,\" spotlighted the role of feminist movements, democratic reforms being undertaken by governments in the region, economic justice initiatives, and climate action-while calling for renewed global solidarity rooted in human rights and equity.</p><p>\"Latin America is home to some of the most vibrant, courageous movements in the world,\" Nowrojee said. \"It's where decades of struggle are transforming not just politics, but power itself.\"</p><p>From partnering with local leaders, Open Society has expanded its work to back locally-led initiatives that advance gender justice, protect environmental defenders, and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><p>Nowrojee praised Mexico's historic progress on gender parity, including the recent election of President Claudia Sheinbaum, and pointed to broader shifts across the region-from Argentina's abortion rights victory to Indigenous-led movements defending democracy in Guatemala.</p><p>\"These are not symbolic victories,\" she emphasized. \"They are the result of organized, persistent activism. And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff. Open Society is a nonpartisan organization that does not engage in political campaign activity. The false accusations against our staff are not just reckless but also dangerous.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   FOUNDATIONS COMMIT $36.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO PROTECT PUBLIC MEDIA IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES</p><p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Pivotal, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today announced that they will commit nearly $37 million to provide immediate relief to public media stations at risk of closure following federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).</p><p>The recent rescission of $1.1 billion in federal funding for CPB will have dire impacts on the nation's more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Some 115 stations - serving 43 million people - are losing more than 30 percent of their budgets, according to the most recent data available.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION GALLERY PRESENTS BODY VESSEL CLAY: BLACK WOMEN, CERAMICS &amp; CONTEMPORARY ART</p><p>New York, NY - The Ford Foundation Gallery is pleased to present Body Vessel Clay: Black Women, Ceramics &amp; Contemporary Art, opening on September 10th with a celebration from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p>Body Vessel Clay brings together three generations of groundbreaking Black women artists whose work with clay explores the medium's multilayered cultural and political significance. Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

So many rich conversations about organizations and leadership can come out of it: It gets into the idea of multiple versions of yourself, and which versions may come to the fore in different contexts. It asks the question: Why would a company want its employees to be severed? Is it about risk management? Is it about control? Is it about blind allegiance to the mission?

The reason I recommend cycling is that you get emotional and mental benefits as well as physical benefits. Mentally, cycling gives me time to really think things through, to work through what's in my head. Emotionally, it's a great way to release stress I didn't even know I had, it's very cathartic. And it's a great way to get to know what's in your neighborhood: You become more aware of your surroundings.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HARVARD UNIVERSITY: GETTING TO THE ROOT OF TEEN DISTRACTED DRIVING</p><p>7 in 10 young people use cellphones while behind the wheel, finds a new study that also takes a look at why</p><p>Every year, hundreds of people die in automobile accidents involving distracted teen drivers. A new study zeroes in on one of the most common forms of distraction, cellphone use, exploring how often young people engage in the risky behavior and why.</p><p>A team of public health researchers led by Rebecca Robbins, professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H.

A collaboration announced this week with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) will offer study abroad opportunities for undergraduates during the academic year and the summer. Additionally, earlier this month, Harvard Medical School opened applications for the Kalaniyot Postdoctoral Fellowships for Israeli researchers.

Today, it has expanded to three campuses, which are home to 20,000 students and 4,000 faculty members. Its community is engaged in cutting-edge research and academics in the sciences, history and the humanities, and business and management, and the school is a regional leader in research on climate change and desert studies. In addition to its three campuses, BGU is home to several multi-disciplinary research institutes specializing in biotechnology, solar energy, desert research, and Jewish and Israeli culture, among other areas. Its more than 100,000 alumni hold leading roles in research and development, healthcare, industry, and culture across Israel and the world. One noteworthy aspect of BGU's mission is its commitment to social and environmental responsibility. The university is actively engaged in developing the Negev, Israel, and the region.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HARVARD UNIVERSITYHARVARD WELCOMES SECOND COHORT OF HBCU EXECUTIVE LEADERS</p><p>This month, Harvard University welcomed its second cohort of presidential fellows from historically Black colleges and universities to participate in the Seminar for New Presidents.

And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPENSOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker. Gerken is the current dean of Yale Law School and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and democracy.</p><p>\"Heather Gerken brings a wealth of experience working across the philanthropic and legal sectors that will only help sharpen the Ford Foundation's operations and grantmaking,\" said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. \"In Heather, we have found a thoughtful and innovative leader with a knowledge and passion for justice that is centered on the values of democracy and helping advance human achievement for all citizens.

And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.

The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 11: Eastern Michigan University President James Smith and Connie Ruhl-Smith to receive Public Media Impact Award</p><p>The Michigan Association of Broadcasters (MAB) is honoring Eastern Michigan University President James Smith and Connie Ruhl-Smith with the Public Media Impact Award during its Summer Leadership Conference on Aug. 12 in Traverse City.</p><p>The Public Media Impact Award is one of the MAB's highest honors, presented annually to two recipients-one professional and one donor-in recognition of their outstanding contributions to public broadcasting in Michigan.

Eastern's Board of Regents approved the new educational program during its June 26 meeting.</p><p>The combined Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in TESOL is a five-year program designed for students who aim to earn both undergraduate and graduate degrees while gaining the advanced expertise required in today's diverse TESOL environments.</p><p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for adult basic and secondary education and English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers continues to grow, with approximately 4,100 openings projected each year over the next decade. The need to replace retiring educators and meet the growing global demand for English instruction is driving this trend.</p><p>Students will spend their first three years engaged in undergraduate studies and their final two completing the graduate program. The curriculum requires an internship, teaching practicum and other field experiences. Upon successful completion, students will have a substantial hands-on learning experience in TESOL.</p><p>EMU's TESOL program is already known for its nationally accredited undergraduate and graduate offerings, including a TESOL minor, bachelor's and master's degrees, and a graduate certificate.</p><p>Beyond classroom instruction, the program emphasizes hands-on engagement with local, regional, and global communities. Students are encouraged to participate in international internships, and EMU's long-standing partnerships with global universities further enrich the academic experience.</p><p>Students also receive support through academic advising, professional mentoring, and opportunities to present at conferences such as the Undergraduate Symposium, the Graduate Research Conference, the Michigan TESOL Conference, and the international TESOL Convention, as well as co-publications.</p><p>June 25: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan UniversityEsports to launch first-ever summer camp for middle school students</p><p>Eastern Michigan University's Esports program is launching its first-ever EMUEsports Summer Camp July 14-18 at the EMU Student Center, located at 900 Oakwood St. in Ypsilanti.

This competitive fellowship will support the completion of his forthcoming book, Punishing Promise: School Discipline and Carceral Expansion during the Era of Desegregation, under contract with the University of Pennsylvania Press.</p><p>The book uses Boston as a case study to explore how white resistance to school desegregation during the mid-20th century intensified the carceral functions of schools. Kautz's research traces how local opposition to integration shaped policies and practices that ultimately helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration in the United States.</p><p>\"This work is inspired by my time as an educator in Detroit, Chicago, and New York, where I witnessed students with incredible potential navigating systems that were too often hostile to their growth,\" said Kautz. \"I wanted to understand how schools became so closely linked to policing and why that connection was so immediate and enduring.\"</p><p>His scholarship has already made an impact in the field, with core arguments from his book appearing in a recent article published in the Harvard Educational Review and further explored in a companion podcast. Kautz has also co-led a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project examining grassroots activism around segregation, integration, and desegregation in Detroit.</p><p>Kautz's work offers valuable insights for education policy and practice today, particularly in light of the increased disciplinary enforcement that has followed the COVID-19 pandemic. \"By understanding how school discipline is tied to broader systems like policing, prison infrastructure, and labor market conditions, we can better respond to inequities in education,\" said Kautz.</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer crowned MissMichigan, uses platform to champion youth mental health</p><p>Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer has been crowned Miss.Michigan 2025, a milestone achievement that builds on her long-standing commitment to education and mental health advocacy.

That loss inspired me to encourage kids to have those conversations earlier and to understand that it's okay to ask for help.\"</p><p>Founded in 2021, The Sunflower Project has distributed $6K in social and emotional learning resources to students and families across Michigan. The organization partners with schools and national initiatives, such as MTV's Mental Health Action Day, to shift the narrative around mental health.</p><p>\"When people think about anxiety or suicide prevention, they often associate those topics with darkness,\" said Palmer.</p><p>July 24: First cohort from Eastern Michigan University's College in Prison program to graduate July 30</p><p>Eastern Michigan University will celebrate a groundbreaking milestone: the graduation of the first cohort from its College in Prison program at the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility-the only women's prison in Michigan.

The award celebrates innovation, creativity, and leadership in the field, while encouraging broader recognition and support for public media across the state.</p><p>The nomination for the Smiths was submitted by Molly Motherwell, executive director and general manager of WEMU, EMU's public radio station.</p><p>\"It's extremely uncommon for the top administrators to become the champions WEMU has in Dr. Smith and Dr. Ruhl-Smith,\" said Motherwell. \"From the beginning, they have invested their time, their money, and their pride in WEMU and achieved outstanding results that are more than worthy of the Public Media Impact Award.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University education fueled alum Ebony Cochran's rise as a financial literacy leader and franchise owner</p><p>For Ebony Cochran, success isn't just about climbing the ladder-it's about building one for others to follow. The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University STEM Ed Institute celebrates year of growth and impact through Toyota's Driving Possibilities initiative</p><p>The STEM Education Institute at Eastern Michigan University is celebrating a successful year of innovation, outreach, and partnership through the Toyota-funded Driving Possibilities Initiative, which has reached thousands of students, educators, and families across Southeast Michigan during the 2024-2025 school year.</p><p>This year alone, the initiative engaged nearly 3,400 students in 31 classrooms across Ypsilanti Community Schools (YCS) and Lincoln Consolidated Schools (LCS) through hands-on STEM activities delivered in libraries, classrooms, and large-scale community events. Led by assistant director Zachary Krauss, EMU student assistants, and interns, the STEM outreach team has brought hydrology, meteorology, and engineering concepts to life in innovative and accessible ways.</p><p>\"This year's success proves what happens when education and industry come together with a shared mission,\" said Krauss. \"We've seen students light up during hands-on activities and helped teachers build meaningful STEM connections for their classrooms.\"</p><p>Over the summer, the initiative brought together more than 30 teachers and administrators from YCS, LCS, and the Washtenaw Intermediate School District for a two-day teachers workshop at Toyota's Saline research and development facility. The workshop served as a continuation of the 2024 session, giving educators a space to co-develop experiential STEM curriculum. Attendees heard from Toyota leaders and EMU's Driving Possibilities pillar leads in curriculum, outreach, and workforce development.</p><p>The experience was elevated by Toyota's CHASE Technician Panel, where employees shared personal career journeys, demonstrating the importance of real-world learning and technical career pathways.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

This competitive fellowship will support the completion of his forthcoming book, Punishing Promise: School Discipline and Carceral Expansion during the Era of Desegregation, under contract with the University of Pennsylvania Press.</p><p>The book uses Boston as a case study to explore how white resistance to school desegregation during the mid-20th century intensified the carceral functions of schools. Kautz's research traces how local opposition to integration shaped policies and practices that ultimately helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration in the United States.</p><p>\"This work is inspired by my time as an educator in Detroit, Chicago, and New York, where I witnessed students with incredible potential navigating systems that were too often hostile to their growth,\" said Kautz. \"I wanted to understand how schools became so closely linked to policing and why that connection was so immediate and enduring.\"</p><p>His scholarship has already made an impact in the field, with core arguments from his book appearing in a recent article published in the Harvard Educational Review and further explored in a companion podcast. Kautz has also co-led a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project examining grassroots activism around segregation, integration, and desegregation in Detroit.</p><p>Kautz's work offers valuable insights for education policy and practice today, particularly in light of the increased disciplinary enforcement that has followed the COVID-19 pandemic. \"By understanding how school discipline is tied to broader systems like policing, prison infrastructure, and labor market conditions, we can better respond to inequities in education,\" said Kautz.</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer crowned MissMichigan, uses platform to champion youth mental health</p><p>Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer has been crowned Miss.Michigan 2025, a milestone achievement that builds on her long-standing commitment to education and mental health advocacy. As she prepares to compete for the Miss.America title in September, Palmer remains rooted in service, using her platform to promote early mental health awareness among children through her nonprofit, The Sunflower Project.</p><p>Palmer, who earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education from EMU, is a passionate advocate for mental health. As a suicide attempt and loss survivor, she channels her experiences into empowering others to talk openly about their emotions, especially at a young age.</p><p>\"I lost a close childhood friend to suicide in 2018,\" said Palmer. \"We had similar struggles, but we never talked about them. That loss inspired me to encourage kids to have those conversations earlier and to understand that it's okay to ask for help.\"</p><p>Founded in 2021, The Sunflower Project has distributed $6K in social and emotional learning resources to students and families across Michigan. The organization partners with schools and national initiatives, such as MTV's Mental Health Action Day, to shift the narrative around mental health.</p><p>\"When people think about anxiety or suicide prevention, they often associate those topics with darkness,\" said Palmer.</p><p>July 24: First cohort from Eastern Michigan University's College in Prison program to graduate July 30</p><p>Eastern Michigan University will celebrate a groundbreaking milestone: the graduation of the first cohort from its College in Prison program at the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility-the only women's prison in Michigan.

Over three intensive weekends, they've trekked through prairie fens, wetlands, and undisturbed natural areas, gaining firsthand experience with Michigan's diverse ecosystems.</p><p>Led by Lecturer Jennifer Harper, the hybrid course blends lectures with extensive fieldwork at the University of Michigan Biological Station and EMU's Fish Lake site. Students analyze plant communities, comparing expected ecological profiles with real-world observations and assessing how physical conditions shape species composition and geographic distribution.</p><p>\"This is a very field-immersive course,\" Harper explained. \"Students take ownership of a community, prepare reports on what they expect to see, and then evaluate how closely their field notes match those expectations. It's about engaging with natural communities that are as undisturbed as possible.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 10: Eastern Michigan University: EMU statement in response to media inquiries: Ohio marketing</p><p>Eastern Michigan University continues to extend in-state tuition opportunities to students across the country, including Ohio, as part of a broader effort to make higher education more affordable and accessible. Students in Ohio have benefited from this offering for decades under a 1980 reciprocity agreement between the Michigan State Board of Education and the Ohio Board of Regents.</p><p>EMU's outreach to Ohio students is rooted in regional proximity and shared academic opportunity. Located less than an hour from northwest Ohio, the University has maintained consistent enrollment marketing to the region for many years, just as Ohio institutions regularly engage students in southeast Michigan.</p><p>The University's \"All Are Welcome Here\" message, introduced in 2017, underscores EMU's deeply held commitment to inclusion, access, and student success. This guiding philosophy encourages individuals from all backgrounds to explore their potential, pursue meaningful degrees, and prepare for impactful careers in communities across the country.</p><p>This commitment is vividly captured in these ads, which showcase the university's inclusive spirit and student-centered environment:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca</url> Ltls</p><p>Our priority is supporting students in finding their purpose and launching meaningful careers.</p><p>June 30: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan Universitys Baja racing team ranks second-fastest in Michigan, making history at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers 2025 competition</p><p>Eastern Michigan University's Baja Racing Club made a bold return to competition this year, charging into the record books with a breakthrough performance. Earning the title of second-fastest four-wheel drive motorsport vehicle in Michigan and 66th place overall at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 2025 competition in Mechanicsville, Maryland, this marks the first time the team has officially qualified to compete, making their placement a defining milestone for EMU's engineering and motorsports legacy.</p><p>\"Our placement in Maryland means everything to me,\" said Travis Kurth, an electrical and computer engineering senior and the club's vice president. \"Not only does it emphasize EMU's exceptional engineering school, but it also reflects years of effort from dedicated students who took time out of their busy semesters to work together toward a common goal. It shows the hours of meetings, designing, and manufacturing needed to build a vehicle like this.\"</p><p>During the 2023-24 academic year, the racing club prepared its Baja car to make an impression at the nationally acclaimed Williamsport competition in Pennsylvania last May. However, after passing multiple rounds built to test different areas of the car, the team was unable to complete the final inspection.</p><p>This year, the team was determined to reach the starting line with a new and improved \"Eagle I\", a vehicle they'd been tinkering with since 2021.</p><p>June 26: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan University names Amy Hietapelto as dean of the College of Business</p><p>Eastern Michigan University has appointed Amy Hietapelto as the dean of the College of Business, effective July 16.

The award celebrates innovation, creativity, and leadership in the field, while encouraging broader recognition and support for public media across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The nomination for the Smiths was submitted by Molly Motherwell, executive director and general manager of WEMU, EMU's public radio station.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's extremely uncommon for the top administrators to become the champions WEMU has in Dr. Smith and Dr. Ruhl-Smith,\" said Motherwell. \"From the beginning, they have invested their time, their money, and their pride in WEMU and achieved outstanding results that are more than worthy of the Public Media Impact Award.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University education fueled alum Ebony Cochran's rise as a financial literacy leader and franchise owner</p><p>For Ebony Cochran, success isn't just about climbing the ladder-it's about building one for others to follow. The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University STEM Ed Institute celebrates year of growth and impact through Toyota's Driving Possibilities initiative</p><p>The STEM Education Institute at Eastern Michigan University is celebrating a successful year of innovation, outreach, and partnership through the Toyota-funded Driving Possibilities Initiative, which has reached thousands of students, educators, and families across Southeast Michigan during the 2024-2025 school year.</p><p>This year alone, the initiative engaged nearly 3,400 students in 31 classrooms across Ypsilanti Community Schools (YCS) and Lincoln Consolidated Schools (LCS) through hands-on STEM activities delivered in libraries, classrooms, and large-scale community events. Led by assistant director Zachary Krauss, EMU student assistants, and interns, the STEM outreach team has brought hydrology, meteorology, and engineering concepts to life in innovative and accessible ways.</p><p>\"This year's success proves what happens when education and industry come together with a shared mission,\" said Krauss. \"We've seen students light up during hands-on activities and helped teachers build meaningful STEM connections for their classrooms.\"</p><p>Over the summer, the initiative brought together more than 30 teachers and administrators from YCS, LCS, and the Washtenaw Intermediate School District for a two-day teachers workshop at Toyota's Saline research and development facility. The workshop served as a continuation of the 2024 session, giving educators a space to co-develop experiential STEM curriculum. Attendees heard from Toyota leaders and EMU's Driving Possibilities pillar leads in curriculum, outreach, and workforce development.</p><p>The experience was elevated by Toyota's CHASE Technician Panel, where employees shared personal career journeys, demonstrating the importance of real-world learning and technical career pathways.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University's College Panhellenic recognized nationally with Innovation in Recruitment Award</p><p>The National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), the umbrella organization representing 26 inter/national sororities, has honored Eastern Michigan University's College Panhellenic Association with the 2024-25 Innovation in Recruitment Award, a national recognition celebrating creative and forward-thinking efforts in sorority recruitment.</p><p>Eastern was one of just 39 campuses nationwide to receive the award this year, joining other institutions like Arizona State University, Auburn University, and Colorado State University.</p><p>\"This recognition reflects the dedication, collaboration, and leadership of our Panhellenic community,\" said Alyssa Mohr, coordinator for Fraternity and Sorority Life at Eastern Michigan University. \"Our student leaders reimagined recruitment in a way that prioritized inclusivity, authenticity, and connection. I'm proud of the way our College Panhellenic embraced innovation to serve potential new members better.\"</p><p>The College Panhellenic Innovation in Recruitment Award honors associations that implement thoughtful strategies to enhance the sorority recruitment process. EMU's Panhellenic executive board and chapter leaders collaborated to develop dynamic outreach efforts, enhance education about the sorority experience, and ensure that recruitment was accessible to students.</p><p>\"Eastern's College Panhellenic is student-led and continues to serve as a model for collaboration and impact,\" Mohr added. \"We're grateful to the NPC for recognizing the work being done here on our campus.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August. Ron Staley, a nationally recognized construction executive with four decades of experience managing landmark restoration projects across the U.S. and abroad, and author of \"Ruin to Revival, Restoring Michigan Central Station: The Builders' Journey,\" will lead the course.

This competitive fellowship will support the completion of his forthcoming book, Punishing Promise: School Discipline and Carceral Expansion during the Era of Desegregation, under contract with the University of Pennsylvania Press.</p><p>The book uses Boston as a case study to explore how white resistance to school desegregation during the mid-20th century intensified the carceral functions of schools. Kautz's research traces how local opposition to integration shaped policies and practices that ultimately helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration in the United States.</p><p>\"This work is inspired by my time as an educator in Detroit, Chicago, and New York, where I witnessed students with incredible potential navigating systems that were too often hostile to their growth,\" said Kautz. \"I wanted to understand how schools became so closely linked to policing and why that connection was so immediate and enduring.\"</p><p>His scholarship has already made an impact in the field, with core arguments from his book appearing in a recent article published in the Harvard Educational Review and further explored in a companion podcast. Kautz has also co-led a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project examining grassroots activism around segregation, integration, and desegregation in Detroit.</p><p>Kautz's work offers valuable insights for education policy and practice today, particularly in light of the increased disciplinary enforcement that has followed the COVID-19 pandemic. \"By understanding how school discipline is tied to broader systems like policing, prison infrastructure, and labor market conditions, we can better respond to inequities in education,\" said Kautz.</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer crowned MissMichigan, uses platform to champion youth mental health</p><p>Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer has been crowned Miss.Michigan 2025, a milestone achievement that builds on her long-standing commitment to education and mental health advocacy.

As she prepares to compete for the Miss America title in September, Palmer remains rooted in service, using her platform to promote early mental health awareness among children through her nonprofit, The Sunflower Project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Palmer, who earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education from EMU, is a passionate advocate for mental health. As a suicide attempt and loss survivor, she channels her experiences into empowering others to talk openly about their emotions, especially at a young age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I lost a close childhood friend to suicide in 2018,\" said Palmer. \"We had similar struggles, but we never talked about them. That loss inspired me to encourage kids to have those conversations earlier and to understand that it's okay to ask for help.\"</p><p>Founded in 2021, The Sunflower Project has distributed $6K in social and emotional learning resources to students and families across Michigan. The organization partners with schools and national initiatives, such as MTV's Mental Health Action Day, to shift the narrative around mental health.</p><p>\"When people think about anxiety or suicide prevention, they often associate those topics with darkness,\" said Palmer. \"I wanted to bring light, a more positive, hopeful energy to these conversations, starting with young people.\"</p><p>Palmer's journey began when she was crowned Miss Washtenaw County at 19. Though she once thought she had all the answers, she credits her growth to embracing vulnerability and asking questions. Her advice to students is to ask questions.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 11: Eastern Michigan University President James Smith and Connie Ruhl-Smith to receive Public Media Impact Award</p><p>The Michigan Association of Broadcasters (MAB) is honoring Eastern Michigan University President James Smith and Connie Ruhl-Smith with the Public Media Impact Award during its Summer Leadership Conference on Aug. 12 in Traverse City.</p><p>The Public Media Impact Award is one of the MAB's highest honors, presented annually to two recipients-one professional and one donor-in recognition of their outstanding contributions to public broadcasting in Michigan. The award celebrates innovation, creativity, and leadership in the field, while encouraging broader recognition and support for public media across the state.</p><p>The nomination for the Smiths was submitted by Molly Motherwell, executive director and general manager of WEMU, EMU's public radio station.</p><p>\"It's extremely uncommon for the top administrators to become the champions WEMU has in Dr. Smith and Dr. Ruhl-Smith,\" said Motherwell. \"From the beginning, they have invested their time, their money, and their pride in WEMU and achieved outstanding results that are more than worthy of the Public Media Impact Award.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University education fueled alum Ebony Cochran's rise as a financial literacy leader and franchise owner</p><p>For Ebony Cochran, success isn't just about climbing the ladder-it's about building one for others to follow. The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University STEM Ed Institute celebrates year of growth and impact through Toyota's Driving Possibilities initiative</p><p>The STEM Education Institute at Eastern Michigan University is celebrating a successful year of innovation, outreach, and partnership through the Toyota-funded Driving Possibilities Initiative, which has reached thousands of students, educators, and families across Southeast Michigan during the 2024-2025 school year.</p><p>This year alone, the initiative engaged nearly 3,400 students in 31 classrooms across Ypsilanti Community Schools (YCS) and Lincoln Consolidated Schools (LCS) through hands-on STEM activities delivered in libraries, classrooms, and large-scale community events. Led by assistant director Zachary Krauss, EMU student assistants, and interns, the STEM outreach team has brought hydrology, meteorology, and engineering concepts to life in innovative and accessible ways.</p><p>\"This year's success proves what happens when education and industry come together with a shared mission,\" said Krauss. \"We've seen students light up during hands-on activities and helped teachers build meaningful STEM connections for their classrooms.\"</p><p>Over the summer, the initiative brought together more than 30 teachers and administrators from YCS, LCS, and the Washtenaw Intermediate School District for a two-day teachers workshop at Toyota's Saline research and development facility. The workshop served as a continuation of the 2024 session, giving educators a space to co-develop experiential STEM curriculum. Attendees heard from Toyota leaders and EMU's Driving Possibilities pillar leads in curriculum, outreach, and workforce development.</p><p>The experience was elevated by Toyota's CHASE Technician Panel, where employees shared personal career journeys, demonstrating the importance of real-world learning and technical career pathways.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University's College Panhellenic recognized nationally with Innovation in Recruitment Award</p><p>The National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), the umbrella organization representing 26 inter/national sororities, has honored Eastern Michigan University's College Panhellenic Association with the 2024-25 Innovation in Recruitment Award, a national recognition celebrating creative and forward-thinking efforts in sorority recruitment.</p><p>Eastern was one of just 39 campuses nationwide to receive the award this year, joining other institutions like Arizona State University, Auburn University, and Colorado State University.</p><p>\"This recognition reflects the dedication, collaboration, and leadership of our Panhellenic community,\" said Alyssa Mohr, coordinator for Fraternity and Sorority Life at Eastern Michigan University. \"Our student leaders reimagined recruitment in a way that prioritized inclusivity, authenticity, and connection. I'm proud of the way our College Panhellenic embraced innovation to serve potential new members better.\"</p><p>The College Panhellenic Innovation in Recruitment Award honors associations that implement thoughtful strategies to enhance the sorority recruitment process. EMU's Panhellenic executive board and chapter leaders collaborated to develop dynamic outreach efforts, enhance education about the sorority experience, and ensure that recruitment was accessible to students.</p><p>\"Eastern's College Panhellenic is student-led and continues to serve as a model for collaboration and impact,\" Mohr added. \"We're grateful to the NPC for recognizing the work being done here on our campus.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

Ron Staley</p><p>Staley brings a wealth of real-world expertise to EMU students, having led high-profile restorations, including the Michigan State Capitol, the Virginia State Capitol, the U.S. Capitol, and Detroit's newly reopened Michigan Central Station. He also served as construction manager on the restoration of Ernest Hemingway's former residence in Cuba.

Eastern's Board of Regents approved the new educational program during its June 26 meeting.</p><p>The combined Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in TESOL is a five-year program designed for students who aim to earn both undergraduate and graduate degrees while gaining the advanced expertise required in today's diverse TESOL environments.</p><p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for adult basic and secondary education and English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers continues to grow, with approximately 4,100 openings projected each year over the next decade. The need to replace retiring educators and meet the growing global demand for English instruction is driving this trend.</p><p>Students will spend their first three years engaged in undergraduate studies and their final two completing the graduate program. The curriculum requires an internship, teaching practicum and other field experiences. Upon successful completion, students will have a substantial hands-on learning experience in TESOL.</p><p>EMU's TESOL program is already known for its nationally accredited undergraduate and graduate offerings, including a TESOL minor, bachelor's and master's degrees, and a graduate certificate.</p><p>Beyond classroom instruction, the program emphasizes hands-on engagement with local, regional, and global communities. Students are encouraged to participate in international internships, and EMU's long-standing partnerships with global universities further enrich the academic experience.</p><p>Students also receive support through academic advising, professional mentoring, and opportunities to present at conferences such as the Undergraduate Symposium, the Graduate Research Conference, the Michigan TESOL Conference, and the international TESOL Convention, as well as co-publications.</p><p>June 25: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan UniversityEsports to launch first-ever summer camp for middle school students</p><p>Eastern Michigan University's Esports program is launching its first-ever EMUEsports Summer Camp July 14-18 at the EMU Student Center, located at 900 Oakwood St. in Ypsilanti.

This competitive fellowship will support the completion of his forthcoming book, Punishing Promise: School Discipline and Carceral Expansion during the Era of Desegregation, under contract with the University of Pennsylvania Press.</p><p>The book uses Boston as a case study to explore how white resistance to school desegregation during the mid-20th century intensified the carceral functions of schools. Kautz's research traces how local opposition to integration shaped policies and practices that ultimately helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration in the United States.</p><p>\"This work is inspired by my time as an educator in Detroit, Chicago, and New York, where I witnessed students with incredible potential navigating systems that were too often hostile to their growth,\" said Kautz. \"I wanted to understand how schools became so closely linked to policing and why that connection was so immediate and enduring.\"</p><p>His scholarship has already made an impact in the field, with core arguments from his book appearing in a recent article published in the Harvard Educational Review and further explored in a companion podcast. Kautz has also co-led a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project examining grassroots activism around segregation, integration, and desegregation in Detroit.</p><p>Kautz's work offers valuable insights for education policy and practice today, particularly in light of the increased disciplinary enforcement that has followed the COVID-19 pandemic. \"By understanding how school discipline is tied to broader systems like policing, prison infrastructure, and labor market conditions, we can better respond to inequities in education,\" said Kautz.</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>July 24: First cohort from Eastern Michigan University's College in Prison program to graduate July 30</p><p>Eastern Michigan University will celebrate a groundbreaking milestone: the graduation of the first cohort from its College in Prison program at the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility-the only women's prison in Michigan.

Over three intensive weekends, they've trekked through prairie fens, wetlands, and undisturbed natural areas, gaining firsthand experience with Michigan's diverse ecosystems.</p><p>Led by Lecturer Jennifer Harper, the hybrid course blends lectures with extensive fieldwork at the University of Michigan Biological Station and EMU's Fish Lake site. Students analyze plant communities, comparing expected ecological profiles with real-world observations and assessing how physical conditions shape species composition and geographic distribution.</p><p>\"This is a very field-immersive course,\" Harper explained. \"Students take ownership of a community, prepare reports on what they expect to see, and then evaluate how closely their field notes match those expectations. It's about engaging with natural communities that are as undisturbed as possible.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 10: Eastern Michigan University: EMU statement in response to media inquiries: Ohio marketing</p><p>Eastern Michigan University continues to extend in-state tuition opportunities to students across the country, including Ohio, as part of a broader effort to make higher education more affordable and accessible. Students in Ohio have benefited from this offering for decades under a 1980 reciprocity agreement between the Michigan State Board of Education and the Ohio Board of Regents.</p><p>EMU's outreach to Ohio students is rooted in regional proximity and shared academic opportunity. Located less than an hour from northwest Ohio, the University has maintained consistent enrollment marketing to the region for many years, just as Ohio institutions regularly engage students in southeast Michigan.</p><p>The University's \"All Are Welcome Here\" message, introduced in 2017, underscores EMU's deeply held commitment to inclusion, access, and student success. This guiding philosophy encourages individuals from all backgrounds to explore their potential, pursue meaningful degrees, and prepare for impactful careers in communities across the country.</p><p>This commitment is vividly captured in these ads, which showcase the university's inclusive spirit and student-centered environment:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKPoXF1ZC-E&amp;list=PLk3R1U5ZOvXj2UoJPBOkPzvXTueca</url> Ltls</p><p>Our priority is supporting students in finding their purpose and launching meaningful careers.</p><p>June 30: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan Universitys Baja racing team ranks second-fastest in Michigan, making history at the Baja Society of Automotive Engineers 2025 competition</p><p>Eastern Michigan University's Baja Racing Club made a bold return to competition this year, charging into the record books with a breakthrough performance.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before. The practical lessons and the stories shared by professors gave me insights I couldn't get anywhere else.\"</p><p>That foundation laid the groundwork for what would become an entrepreneurial journey. After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy. Her curiosity and compassion sparked a transformation where she boosted her credit score from 486 to 813 and became inspired to help others do the same.</p><p>That effort evolved into Blackwood Credit Services and her brand, The Debt Survivor, both of which focus on equipping clients with the knowledge and tools to overcome debt and build sustainable wealth.</p><p>In a bold move, Cochran went on to own a Little Caesars franchise in Michigan. \"I didn't know I was breaking barriers at the time,\" she said. \"I just wanted to try something new and challenge myself beyond the service-based businesses I had run before.\" That spirit of risk-taking and reinvention would ultimately lay the foundation for her next and most ambitious chapter, one rooted not just in business but in community transformation.</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University's College Panhellenic recognized nationally with Innovation in Recruitment Award</p><p>The National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), the umbrella organization representing 26 inter/national sororities, has honored Eastern Michigan University's College Panhellenic Association with the 2024-25 Innovation in Recruitment Award, a national recognition celebrating creative and forward-thinking efforts in sorority recruitment.</p><p>Eastern was one of just 39 campuses nationwide to receive the award this year, joining other institutions like Arizona State University, Auburn University, and Colorado State University.</p><p>\"This recognition reflects the dedication, collaboration, and leadership of our Panhellenic community,\" said Alyssa Mohr, coordinator for Fraternity and Sorority Life at Eastern Michigan University. \"Our student leaders reimagined recruitment in a way that prioritized inclusivity, authenticity, and connection. I'm proud of the way our College Panhellenic embraced innovation to serve potential new members better.\"</p><p>The College Panhellenic Innovation in Recruitment Award honors associations that implement thoughtful strategies to enhance the sorority recruitment process. EMU's Panhellenic executive board and chapter leaders collaborated to develop dynamic outreach efforts, enhance education about the sorority experience, and ensure that recruitment was accessible to students.</p><p>\"Eastern's College Panhellenic is student-led and continues to serve as a model for collaboration and impact,\" Mohr added. \"We're grateful to the NPC for recognizing the work being done here on our campus.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 23: Eastern Michigan University launches new course led by historic preservationist and construction veteran Ron Staley</p><p>Eastern Michigan University is expanding its nationally recognized historic preservation program with a new course titled \"Building Preservation Technology,\" set to launch in August.

This competitive fellowship will support the completion of his forthcoming book, Punishing Promise: School Discipline and Carceral Expansion during the Era of Desegregation, under contract with the University of Pennsylvania Press.</p><p>The book uses Boston as a case study to explore how white resistance to school desegregation during the mid-20th century intensified the carceral functions of schools. Kautz's research traces how local opposition to integration shaped policies and practices that ultimately helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration in the United States.</p><p>\"This work is inspired by my time as an educator in Detroit, Chicago, and New York, where I witnessed students with incredible potential navigating systems that were too often hostile to their growth,\" said Kautz. \"I wanted to understand how schools became so closely linked to policing and why that connection was so immediate and enduring.\"</p><p>His scholarship has already made an impact in the field, with core arguments from his book appearing in a recent article published in the Harvard Educational Review and further explored in a companion podcast. Kautz has also co-led a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project examining grassroots activism around segregation, integration, and desegregation in Detroit.</p><p>Kautz's work offers valuable insights for education policy and practice today, particularly in light of the increased disciplinary enforcement that has followed the COVID-19 pandemic. \"By understanding how school discipline is tied to broader systems like policing, prison infrastructure, and labor market conditions, we can better respond to inequities in education,\" said Kautz.</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>August 06: Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer crowned MissMichigan, uses platform to champion youth mental health</p><p>Eastern Michigan University alum Hannah Palmer has been crowned Miss.Michigan 2025, a milestone achievement that builds on her long-standing commitment to education and mental health advocacy.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.
