And with help from her coworkers in Charleston, South Carolina, she's got a composting pile to prove it.</p><p>The resiliency and nature-based solutions engineer's home garden has some of the richest dirt imaginable, courtesy of the workplace composting drive that has taken root.</p><p>With enthusiastic help from officemates, Henneman - an employee-owner of the Kansas-based global human critical infrastructure leader since 2022 - already has collected hundreds of pounds of otherwise landfill-bound throwaways that now nourish her backyard trove. A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind. At a time of growing climate change concerns, throw extreme weather into the mix.</p><p>Now with mentoring from global infrastructure solutions leader Black &amp; Veatch, five startups are striving to perfect and scale answers - including the promise of evolving artificial intelligence and robotics technology - to some of those complex headwinds that often can make or break a project.</p><p>Black &amp; Veatch has chosen a cohort of forward-thinking entrepreneurs to participate in its 2025 BV IgniteX accelerator, this time focusing on innovative project execution.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

And with help from her coworkers in Charleston, South Carolina, she's got a composting pile to prove it.</p><p>The resiliency and nature-based solutions engineer's home garden has some of the richest dirt imaginable, courtesy of the workplace composting drive that has taken root.</p><p>With enthusiastic help from officemates, Henneman - an employee-owner of the Kansas-based global human critical infrastructure leader since 2022 - already has collected hundreds of pounds of otherwise landfill-bound throwaways that now nourish her backyard trove. A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind. At a time of growing climate change concerns, throw extreme weather into the mix.</p><p>Now with mentoring from global infrastructure solutions leader Black &amp; Veatch, five startups are striving to perfect and scale answers - including the promise of evolving artificial intelligence and robotics technology - to some of those complex headwinds that often can make or break a project.</p><p>Black &amp; Veatch has chosen a cohort of forward-thinking entrepreneurs to participate in its 2025 BV IgniteX accelerator, this time focusing on innovative project execution. As part of the 12-week program demonstrating the rigor of Black &amp; Veatch's culture of innovation, participants collaborate with the company's subject matter experts who provide consultation and support towards co-developing, piloting and marketing their new technologies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH POWERS THE PHILIPPINES' FIRST MEGAWATT-SCALE FLOATING SOLAR FACILITY</p><p>Black &amp; Veatch, a global leader in human critical infrastructure, has successfully delivered the Philippines' first megawatt-scale floating solar photovoltaic (PV) facility, marking a milestone in renewable energy innovation and sustainable mining practices.</p><p>Commissioned by Carmen Copper Corporation, the 3-hectare floating solar array on Malubog Reservoir features 8,540 solar panels generating up to 4.99 megawatts (MW) of clean energy - enough to meet 10% of the mine's power needs, the first step to meeting the Philippines Department of Energy goals of 35% by 2030.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

That is the concern of an interdisciplinary research project at Heidelberg University, located at the interface of chemistry, physics and AI research. The goal of the project \"Quantum Chemistry without Orbitals\" is to forecast the properties of much more complex systems than has as yet been possible. The project was initiated by Prof. Dr Fred Hamprecht and Prof. Dr Andreas Dreuw from the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing and Prof. Dr Maurits W. Haverkort from the Institute for Theoretical Physics. The Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung has allocated more than 745,000 euros to fund the research work for a period of two years.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HEIDELBERGER BRUCKE: CLIMATE ACTION IN TIMES OF GLOBAL CRISES AND SOCIAL UPHEAVALS</p><p>Environmental science colloquium features online and in-person events Action to mitigate climate change in times of global crises and upheavals in society will be addressed at the colloquium \"Heidelberger Brucke\" taking place in the 2025 summer semester.

This has a huge impact on health and wellbeing, with an estimated 30,000 deaths attributed to air pollution every year in the UK, and increasing rates of inflammatory diseases in children. However, very little is known about the mechanisms by which the exposome causes disease.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD PAST THEIR PRIME TOOL USE DECLINES WITH AGE IN WILD CHIMPANZEES</p><p>Wild chimpanzees show reduced participation and performance in their tool-use behaviours as they grow older, according to the long-term video observations used in the new study. This provides solid evidence that old age leads to gradual withdrawal from tool use, and is a contributing factor to lower efficiency in chimps' stone tool selection and use.</p><p>The findings also indicate that chimpanzees mirror human beings in how the aging process affects their ability to carry out dextrous and cognitively-challenging daily tasks. Similar to humans, the effects of old-age varied considerably between individuals, with some chimpanzees struggling to use tools, whilst others maintained excellent performance into later life.</p><p>Wild chimpanzees use tools during some of the most cognitively and physically demanding foraging behaviours observed in non-human animals. While the behavioural changes that occur with aging have been widely studied in humans and some captive primates, exceptionally little is known about how growing older affects the lives of elderly wild apes. This includes how the capacity to address technical, real-world tasks changes as chimpanzees become progressively older.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-210725043558980005670325104950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G9K-2VR3-RS0D-H1FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

The dry soil a long dry spell leaves in its wake can repel water rather than letting it soak in as damp soil would, meaning it is harder to hold water when and where it is most needed.</p><p>In areas like Speyside - home to half Scotland's malt distillers - ensuring a continuous water supply, both now and in the future, is essential as temporary closures can cost the industry millions of pounds.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN: VERSUS ARTHRITIS INVESTS IN 'TEAM SCIENCE' TO MEET CHALLENGES FACED BY PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS</p><p>Charity Versus Arthritis has awarded Pound3m to bring together world-leading experts from five UK universities - including the University of Aberdeen - to accelerate clinical epidemiology research, which will help answer pressing questions from those living with arthritis.</p><p>The new research consortium is part of the charity's drive to harness 'team science' to better understand the causes and risk factors for arthritis and improve treatment options.</p><p>Epidemiology - the study of how diseases occur in different people and why - is critical to designing better and targeted interventions using data. The consortium, made up of experts from the Universities of Manchester, Keele, Oxford, Nottingham and Aberdeen, aims to close five gaps in our understanding of the debilitating disease and related conditions. They will consider menopause in relation to musculoskeletal health, inequalities in access to care, risks of long-term pain medications and determine the optimum levels of monitoring for those receiving immune drugs. The researchers will also aim to identify those at higher risk of chronic pain sooner, given painful musculoskeletal conditions often begin in childhood. This holds the potential to explore ways to prevent or reduce persistent pain.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN: 'EARTH'S HEARTBEAT' BEING MONITORED BY SENSOR IN ABERDEENSHIRE FIELD</p><p>Thunder and lightning strikes that create electromagnetic waves dubbed 'Earth's heartbeat' are being monitored by a sensor inside a box in a rural Aberdeenshire field.</p><p>The University of Aberdeen device is only one of two in the UK that measure Schumann Resonance - extremely low frequency waves that can be used to study our weather and - some believe - possibly predict earthquakes and may even be linked to our health, sleep and emotions.</p><p>Flashes of lightning strike the Earth around 50 times every second sending out tiny waves of energy that bounce back and forth between the ground and the sky in the space known as Earth's ionosphere - this is called Schumann's Resonance.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN: NEW SCULPTURE IN CRUICKSHANK GARDEN - A BEAUTIFUL SPOT FOR REFLECTION, CHAT OR MOMENT OF PEACE</p><p>As the weather starts to get better, a stunning new addition to the University of Aberdeen's Cruickshank Botanic Garden is set to offer visitors an additional peaceful place to gather their thoughts.</p><p>Now in place on the 'Beech Lawn', on the south-west corner towards the Rose Garden, is a striking new bench, which has been carved from fallen timber by world-renowned sculptor, Nigel Ross.</p><p>Adorned with the words 'memories', 'play', 'forever', 'outdoors' and 'learn'; as a living memorial, the bench has been thoughtfully designed to honour a special person, to whom it is dedicated.</p><p>Curator of the Cruickshank Botanic Garden, Mark Paterson, said: \"I was approached by a family who wanted to further enhance CBG and at the same time provide a memorial to someone they loved and who loved the garden.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Because high TDS wastewater cannot be discharged into local freshwater sources - as treated municipal wastewater can - advanced water management practices like Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Minimal Liquid Discharge (MLD) are becoming more popular. These methods help reduce wastewater and protect water supplies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   BALFOUR BEATTY PLC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   BALFOUR BEATTY ANNOUNCES DIVIDEND</p><p>Balfour Beatty today announced an interim dividend of GBX4.20 per share.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations.

It's a beautiful part of the world, but reconciling that beauty with what is happening on the ground is getting harder by the week. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lake Macquarie City Council (LMCC) continues to actively pursue population growth ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8971556/lake-macquarie-council-criticised-for-90k-spend-on-sydney-promo/\"> Lake Mac woos Sydney millennials with $90,000 coffee and VR </url>', <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NH</emphasis> 21/5) and heralds every growth milestone as a triumph, as if it's business as usual, while the climate crisis escalates.</p><p>In the past six months alone, Lake Macquarie has been declared a natural disaster area twice, first in January and again in May. Torrential rain, violent storms, and widespread flooding inundated homes, severed roads and racked up millions in damage. These are not \"once-in-a-generation\" events. They are the new normal, warning signs: loud, frequent, and increasingly devastating.</p><p>Last week, LMCC unveiled its draft <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Teralba to Toronto (T2T) Climate Resilience Plan</emphasis>, which paints a sobering picture of what residents in the city's west can expect as climate impacts intensify. The projections are stark: severe fire weather days up 45 per cent by 2030 and 130 per cent by 2090 (relative to 1995); extreme rainfall events up 10 per cent by 2030 and almost 20 per cent by 2050; lake level rise of 40cm by 2050, enough to inundate 251 homes and threaten another 565.</p><p>These statistics aren't future hypotheticals. They describe what my neighbours, colleagues, and family are already experiencing: more frequent storms, longer recovery times, and a creeping sense of insecurity about the place we call home. But instead of treating this as a wake-up call, some councillors fret about its tone ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8988842/lake-macquarie-climate-plan-will-cost-residents-warns-pauling/\"> More difficult': Councillor issues warning on climate plan's impact </url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NH</emphasis> 10/6). Cr Jason Pauling criticised the strategy for being \"all doom and gloom,\" arguing that spelling out the science would make life \"more difficult\" for residents.</p><p>Facing reality isn't the problem; inaction is.</p><p>As the founder of The Groundswell Collective, a sustainability organisation, I work with communities every day who are already feeling the effects of these changes. They don't need sugar-coating; they need leadership. </p><p>Because while the T2T plan rightly identifies the risks, it does little to address the root causes. What good is a resilience plan if the council continues to push for and approve developments in high-risk floodplains and heat-affected suburbs, clearing the bushland that naturally soaks up water, cools streets and stores carbon? </p><p>Rather than drafting PDFs with scant follow-through, why not prioritise proven nature-based solutions and stop chasing short-term economic wins?</p><p>\"Resilience\" has become a buzzword, too often used to applaud communities for bouncing back instead of preventing harm in the first place. But how long can people keep bouncing back when the ground beneath them, literally and figuratively, is being eroded? </p><p>Real resilience is not about recovery alone; it demands bold, upstream decisions that reduce risk before disaster strikes.</p><p>Is the T2T plan an uplifting bedtime read? No. But it is an honest assessment of what lies ahead if we stay on the current course. </p><p>Climate change is not a distant threat; it is here, accelerating and reshaping our lives.</p><p>The pressing question is whether the council's strategies are being matched with tangible action on the ground. Residents are urged to \"prepare your home, have a plan, be more resilient\", but there is only so much a household can do. Personal preparedness matters, yet it cannot offset the consequences of systemic planning decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the economic costs of inaction are mounting. </p><p>Disaster recovery, road repairs, rising insurance premiums and health impacts already strain household and government budgets. Continuing to prioritise short-term development gains over long-term sustainability only amplifies those bills. Rethinking spending priorities is not merely a climate imperative; it is sound financial governance.</p><p>We cannot grow our way out of this crisis. It is time Lake Macquarie City Council aligned its budgets with climate reality, rethought its spending priorities and matched its bold words with bold action before the next \"once-in-a-generation\" disaster arrives, right on schedule.</p><p>Anna Noon is a Lake Macquarie resident with a background in social and environmental justice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/SZjBdCvXzdW4Ygt94axh3r/46f38346-e327-442f-b475-eeab5e9a3f55.jpg\">Action from the top is needed to help Lake Macquarie residents contend with climate change.

The dry soil a long dry spell leaves in its wake can repel water rather than letting it soak in as damp soil would, meaning it is harder to hold water when and where it is most needed.</p><p>In areas like Speyside - home to half Scotland's malt distillers - ensuring a continuous water supply, both now and in the future, is essential as temporary closures can cost the industry millions of pounds.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN: VERSUS ARTHRITIS INVESTS IN 'TEAM SCIENCE' TO MEET CHALLENGES FACED BY PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS</p><p>Charity Versus Arthritis has awarded Pound3m to bring together world-leading experts from five UK universities - including the University of Aberdeen - to accelerate clinical epidemiology research, which will help answer pressing questions from those living with arthritis.</p><p>The new research consortium is part of the charity's drive to harness 'team science' to better understand the causes and risk factors for arthritis and improve treatment options.</p><p>Epidemiology - the study of how diseases occur in different people and why - is critical to designing better and targeted interventions using data. The consortium, made up of experts from the Universities of Manchester, Keele, Oxford, Nottingham and Aberdeen, aims to close five gaps in our understanding of the debilitating disease and related conditions. They will consider menopause in relation to musculoskeletal health, inequalities in access to care, risks of long-term pain medications and determine the optimum levels of monitoring for those receiving immune drugs.

With over 28,000 employees, Kiewit delivers projects in transportation, energy, and industrial sectors, including bridges, highways, and oil refineries. Its 2023 revenue was $17 billion.

This process stabilizes harmful pathogens, reduces odors, decreases biosolids volume, helps create cleaner water and reduces harmful waste. Source: Company Website</p><p>+   KIEWIT CORPORATION: BRIDGES REBUILT, COMMUNITIES RESTORED: NOLICHUCKY TEAM DELIVERS EARLY AND GIVES BACK</p><p>After Hurricane Helene devastated parts of East Tennessee in 2024, two major bridges - on SR 107 and SR 81 - were washed away, isolating communities and turning daily commutes into detours.</p><p>To fast-track recovery, the Tennessee Department of Transportation turned to its first-ever progressive design-build contract, selecting Kiewit Infrastructure South Co. for the job.</p><p>Less than eight months later, both bridges are open - SR 107 on May 23 and SR 81 just one day later - completing construction nearly a month ahead of schedule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   KIEWIT CORPORATION: THE FUTURE OF ZERO LIQUID DISCHARGE AND MINIMAL LIQUID DISCHARGE</p><p>Water is one of the most important resources on our planet. As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Because high TDS wastewater cannot be discharged into local freshwater sources - as treated municipal wastewater can - advanced water management practices like Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Minimal Liquid Discharge (MLD) are becoming more popular. These methods help reduce wastewater and protect water supplies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   BALFOUR BEATTY PLC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   BALFOUR BEATTY ANNOUNCES DIVIDEND</p><p>Balfour Beatty today announced an interim dividend of GBX4.20 per share.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Because high TDS wastewater cannot be discharged into local freshwater sources - as treated municipal wastewater can - advanced water management practices like Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Minimal Liquid Discharge (MLD) are becoming more popular. These methods help reduce wastewater and protect water supplies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   BALFOUR BEATTY PLC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   BALFOUR BEATTY ANNOUNCES DIVIDEND</p><p>Balfour Beatty today announced an interim dividend of GBX4.20 per share.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Because high TDS wastewater cannot be discharged into local freshwater sources - as treated municipal wastewater can - advanced water management practices like Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Minimal Liquid Discharge (MLD) are becoming more popular.

The new facility enhances training capabilities and capacity for both male and female recruits.</p><p>Designed in-house by NAVFAC Southwest, the multi-story, 120,000-square-foot barracks represents a major investment in the future of Marine Corps training. The modern, cast-in-place concrete structure is designed to accommodate the demands of recruit training and will feature open-squad bay billeting, central restrooms and showers, dedicated spaces for drill instructors, two company offices, and a separate laundry building.</p><p>This project addresses the critical need for expanded capacity at MCRDSan Diego, particularly during the peak summer training months. The new barracks will ensure the base can support increased recruit loading while avoiding the use of temporary facilities, improving training efficiency and boosting morale. The project will also provide a premier training complex for female recruits, with the capacity to house 75-90 recruits per platoon squad bay.</p><p>\"We pride ourselves on following our very simple motto of 'building what matters,' and I can think of few projects that matter more than this,\" said Mike Guzzi, vice president with Clark Construction. \"I'm extremely proud of being a part of this team and can't wait to deliver this project to the Marine Corps.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH CORPORATION [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   BLACK AND VEATCH ENGINEER'S PASSION FOR COMPOSTING REFLECTS COMPANY'S SUSTAINABILITY FROM THE GROUND UP</p><p>At a time when talk of a company's carbon footprint grabs much of the attention in corporate sustainability reports, Black &amp; Veatch engineer Kasey Henneman knows making the world a better place literally can begin at the ground level.

A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind. At a time of growing climate change concerns, throw extreme weather into the mix.</p><p>Now with mentoring from global infrastructure solutions leader Black &amp; Veatch, five startups are striving to perfect and scale answers - including the promise of evolving artificial intelligence and robotics technology - to some of those complex headwinds that often can make or break a project.</p><p>Black &amp; Veatch has chosen a cohort of forward-thinking entrepreneurs to participate in its 2025 BV IgniteX accelerator, this time focusing on innovative project execution.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations.

This provides solid evidence that old age leads to gradual withdrawal from tool use, and is a contributing factor to lower efficiency in chimps' stone tool selection and use.</p><p>The findings also indicate that chimpanzees mirror human beings in how the aging process affects their ability to carry out dextrous and cognitively-challenging daily tasks. Similar to humans, the effects of old-age varied considerably between individuals, with some chimpanzees struggling to use tools, whilst others maintained excellent performance into later life.</p><p>Wild chimpanzees use tools during some of the most cognitively and physically demanding foraging behaviours observed in non-human animals. While the behavioural changes that occur with aging have been widely studied in humans and some captive primates, exceptionally little is known about how growing older affects the lives of elderly wild apes. This includes how the capacity to address technical, real-world tasks changes as chimpanzees become progressively older.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD EXPERT COMMENT: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY ENERGY SYSTEMS IN ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ENERGY ACCESS</p><p>In the UK, we often take access to energy for granted. Yet it underpins virtually every aspect of daily life-from food and healthcare, to communication and transport. Globally, it enables sustainable development by improving educational outcomes, increasing clean water availability, and building climate adaptation capacity. Its centrality in the UN Sustainable Development Goals underscores a shared understanding: equitable development hinges on universal energy access.</p><p>Achieving this goal, however, is far from straightforward. Though policy-making and planning tends to focus on national-scale grid extension, this is not a panacea. The estimated 750 million people who remain without electricity access globally are predominantly located in rural, remote areas, where traditional grid expansion is neither technically nor financially viable. Even where grids are present, households may lack the means or motivation to connect, or the appliances to make use of their connection. Alternative solutions are needed to close this gap.</p><p>Source: Company website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD MAJOR INVESTMENT FOR NEXT-GENERATION BATTERY RESEARCH FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES</p><p>Since 2017, Prosperity Partnerships have provided investment for academic institutes and businesses to co-create and co-deliver a programme of research activity that directly addresses a clear industrial need.</p><p>For the new project 'Energy storage for decarbonisation', the University of Oxford will partner with Fortescue Zero, a global leader in zero emissions solutions and electrifying mining equipment, to develop safer, longer-lasting, and more efficient industrial batteries for vehicles in difficult-to-decarbonise industries. This work will be led by Professor Paul Shearing and Professor David Howey, both of the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford.</p><p>Heavy-duty industries are vital to the global economy but face major challenges in cutting carbon emissions. There is an urgent need for advanced battery technologies that are safe, long-lasting, and durable enough to withstand tough operating environments.</p><p>Source: Company website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-170725043623980005670323104950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8R-6513-S4VB-B0MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

As industries grow and technology advances, we are placing greater stress on our water resources through increasing demand and the creation of wastewaters that are difficult to treat due to high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations.
