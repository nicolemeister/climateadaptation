We talked about that as a team. Sometimes those sorts of things can be overwhelming, but I think it came out in the mix today.</p><p>\"While we are celebrating, a lot of people are suffering.\"</p><p>Japan beat Scotland in a 28-21 thriller to advance to the quarter-finals for the first time in their history. They have now taken down three major tier one nations at World Cups, following the so-called 'Brighton Miracle' win over South Africa in 2015, and wins over Ireland and Scotland this year.</p><p>They will face South Africa at Tokyo Stadium next Sunday night in what promises to be a high-octane rematch of the famous 34-32 win that put the Brave Blossoms on the map at home and abroad.</p><p>Captain Michael Leitch said the team felt the game was about more than just their own glory.</p><p>\"Before the match started at the team hotel, the players already knew how this game was more than just us, that a lot of people suffered in the typhoon for this game to happen,\" Leitch said.</p><p>\"There were guys up late last night with sponges.</p><p>\"We are grateful for the opportunity to inspire Japan and we showed that for 80 minutes tonight.\"</p><p>It was bitter disappointment for Scotland and coach Gregor Townsend, despite a two-try comeback that put the capacity crowd on tenterhooks for the final 15 minutes.</p><p>Scotland crawled out of a 28-7 hole to challenge until the final seconds but, after Ireland beat Samoa, needed to win by more than eight points.</p><p>\"We started really well but then we didn't see much of the ball for the rest of the first half,\" Townsend said.</p><p>\"Part of that was down to what Japan were doing when they had the ball, but the two tries we conceded were soft, one from our possession and another from a re-start.</p><p>\"The players put a huge effort into that period after half-time and after 58 minutes we were only seven points behind. But we didn't do enough in that last 20 minutes to get the win.\"</p><p>Townsend was asked whether he thought he was the right coach to keep leading Scotland. Their failure in Japan sees them become only the second Scotland team to bow out of a World Cup in the group stages.</p><p>\"We came here with high aspirations and getting out of the pool was stage one of that. We have worked really hard over the last four months and throughout this tournament to get further than we have. It is very disappointing to not make it out of the pool,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is a lot more in this team. Experiences are what make you as a group, and how you react to these experiences. That was a unique situation we were in tonight.</p><p>\"It was always going to be a challenge given the way Japan were playing and the (three-day) turnaround, but we had the team and the ability to go on and win by the necessary amount of points. That we didn't is a huge disappointment.</p><p>\"You don't get another shot in a World Cup, but we have got to improve as we hit our next tournament in the Six Nations in a few months' time.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520192859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-S6R1-JBJ7-N4YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><timeReceived>06:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Their breakdown, their attack, their goal kicking (captain Stirling Mortlock missed three from four attempts), all wilted under England's unrelenting pressure. Jonny Wilkinson kicked four penalties.</p><p>At the time, coach John Connolly said they had saved their worst for last. Privately, years later, players admitted they had taken it too lightly.</p><p>In the years following Wilkinson's drop goal heartbreak in the 2003 World Cup final, Australia had enjoyed unprecedented dominance over the English, winning all but one of the next five Tests by margins that regularly topped 30 points.</p><p>Not that day. England's tight forwards were in imperious form, pulverising the Wallabies scrum to advance to the final four and then the big one (South Africa won the World Cup final 15-6).</p><p>\"That's always the aim, obviously (loosehead) Andrew Sheridan had a great game that day,\" England scrum coach Neal Hatley said on Monday.</p><p>The teams didn't meet at the 2011 tournament and by 2015, the Wallabies pack had clawed back some respect. It was England's turn to make an embarrassing exit, not even making the final eight.</p><p>Hatley said dominance was always the goal but it was harder and harder to deliver for 80 minutes.</p><p>\"You look at the Australian scrum now, they're a different beast, even from when we played them in November. I think they're a very good scrum,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't there's going to be massive repeats of what you saw. It's not often now - even tier one and tier two - you see one side spank another at the set piece, because a lot of work goes into it.</p><p>\"It will be a highly competitive area and something we're really excited about getting into.\"</p><p>England are crossing fingers and toes that back rower Billy Vunipola will be fit for Saturday's quarter-final in Oita. The Bath No.8 has not played in a World Cup knock-out match since 2011 and was spotted nursing his ankle in a moon boot last week.</p><p>He did not train at the team's base in Miyazaki over the weekend, but the team remained optimistic.</p><p>It was one of many curve balls all teams have had to absorb as Typhoon Hagibis knocked everyone off course, to varying degrees.</p><p>England headed south for Miyazaki as soon as they knew their final pool game against France was over and coach Eddie Jones appears to have flogged his players lest they think the change of plans meant a night off. Hatley said everyone coped well.</p><p>\"It was one of the things we've talked about. You'd be amazed about how many contingencies we have,\" he said.</p><p>\"We knew we could potentially lose a game, so these are the scenarios that Eddie and Steve had first-hand knowledge of from having been with Japan.</p><p>\"The focus immediately shifts to what we could do on Friday and Saturday. Nothing replicates a Test match, but from an intensity point of view we got pretty close to that on Saturday.</p><p>\"The boys worked unbelievably hard and then we start getting ready for a quarter-final. We have a lot of plans in place and it's up to us and the players to make sure they're ready to go.\"</p><p>England were due to take a bus up to Oita on Monday afternoon, while Australia were planning to stay in Odawara until Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520193254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8H-7301-DY19-C1D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><timeReceived>08:53 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They set a course for Odawara, the small city about halfway between Shizuoka and the capital.</p><p>They did not make it there until 3am, after cramming ice baths, recovery, a condensed media conference and a celebration for Rob Simmons's 100th Test into the shortest possible time after the game.</p><p>\"It was quite hectic. Looking back it was pretty funny,\" vice-captain Samu Kerevi said. \"We had music jamming, guys were watching Netflix, some guys were sleeping, some guys were eating. It was raining pretty hard, we put the windows down and tried to taste the rain. It was an awesome trip.</p><p>\"We can't complain, these things are uncontrollable. I thought the staff did really well to organise all this. They worked tirelessly around the clock for us.</p><p>\"There's no complaint from the boys, we understand you can't tell a typhoon to go away. It was all good from us, got on to the bus, the boys were throwing jokes, just trying to make the bus trip really exciting. But halfway through guys were out on their feet, just sleeping, just really tired. We are happy to be here and safe.\"</p><p>While the Wallabies will wait out the storm in relatively comfortable surrounds, Japan and Scotland still remain uncertain whether their final pool match will go ahead on Sunday. World Rugby will make a decision on the morning of the match after assessing the amount of rain and damage the typhoon has left behind.</p><p>The curve ball for the Wallabies has delayed their journey to Oita until midweek but mirrors England's move back to their pre-tournament base in beachside Miyazaki after their pool match against France was called off.</p><p>The Wallabies were finding plenty of solace in the fact they were back in a familiar and fondly-remembered spot.</p><p>\"This is the perfect place for us to be at the moment, in terms of our familiarity. This is basically home for us, being here is awesome,\" Kerevi said. \"The facilities are awesome, the rooms, we've got our gym in the hotel, so in terms of that, travel is minimised besides going to the fields. Our recovery is here, I think that was the biggest one for us, minimising our travel time in terms of between training sessions. Being able to go one bus out to training and still get our sleep in, our recovery.</p><p>\"The food here is awesome, the staff here are awesome. We couldn't have had it any better.\"</p><p>The physical distance between the two sides could cool the adversarial dynamic already developing between the coaches late last week.</p><p>Michael Cheika didn't miss an opportunity to remind Eddie Jones, his former Randwick teammate, that Jones - in what increasingly looked like a poor choice of words - suggested the \"typhoon gods\" were smiling on him.</p><p>\"I saw he was saying that [not playing France] would be an advantage and the typhoon gods were smiling on him,\" Cheika said. \"So I suppose they'd better win. They've had the best preparation, according to the coach, so they'd better go out there and win. If that's the best possible preparation.

It has gone from a tropical storm to a category five typhoon in the space of 24 hours and according to The Weather Network website is the \"strongest storm anywhere in the world\" and could be the most destructive anywhere on earth this year.</p><p>The storm was initially set to hit southern Japan on Saturday, meaning the Wallabies' upcoming game against Georgia in Shizuoka would not be affected. However, meteorologists now believe the typhoon is more likely to hit further north in Yokohama and Tokyo, where there are important, pool-defining matches this weekend.</p><p>World Rugby is monitoring the situation closely. It can expect a massive backlash if a natural disaster, which is a regular occurrence in Japan, was to mar the final weekend of the pool rounds.</p><p>Citizen safety is an issue too given typhoons force residents to stay indoors. Winds between 250km/h and 300km/h have been forecast at this early stage but there is a chance the storm won't hit despite numerous warnings.</p><p>In Australia's pool, Wales could be the big losers and miss out on top spot despite beating the Wallabies in Tokyo. Wales' match against Fiji today will not be affected, but a clash on Sunday with Uruguay, who they are expected to beat with a bonus point, may be cancelled or possibly moved due to the weather.</p><p>Rugby World Cup rules state that in abandoned matches the competing teams split the four points, taking two each.</p><p>There are dozens of possible outcomes but the Wallabies will be crossing their fingers they can take the field against Georgia and Wales cannot against Uruguay.</p><p>If Wales beat Fiji without a bonus point, they will go two points clear of Australia (13 points to 11 points) with a game remaining each. If Australia then pick up a winning bonus point over Georgia, which is highly likely, they will go three points atop Pool D (16 points to Wales on 13).</p><p>That means if Wales' final fixture is washed out, the northern hemisphere side will fall a point short of the Wallabies as they will get only two points for a match that had to be cancelled.</p><p>However, if Wales get a bonus-point win tonight over Fiji, the best the Wallabies can hope for is to be tied on points with Wales if the weekend game is cancelled. That would see Warren Gatland's side go through on a countback because they defeated Australia 29-25. If Wales lose to Fiji, Australia's chances of finishing first increase significantly.</p><p>Topping the pool for Australia would likely see them avoid England in a quarter-final and come up against France instead. However, the England and France match in Yokohama on Saturday could also be affected by the typhoon.</p><p>Because England (15 points) are ahead of France (13 points), they would finish top of Pool C if the match was cancelled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Scotland and Ireland's World Cup campaigns could be affected by the typhoons if their matches against Japan and Samoa respectively are abandoned.</p><p>If Scotland (5 points currently), can claim nine points (the equivalent of a win and a bonus point win) in their next two matches, Ireland (11 points) could be booted out of the World Cup if their last pool match, against Samoa on Saturday in Fukuoka City, is cancelled and they split the points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77fyo27diozo84nx2mm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X75-S2J1-F0J6-J0BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DAVZ</classCode><className>KANTO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC364</classCode><className>URUGUAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They set a course for Odawara, the small city about halfway between Shizuoka and the capital.</p><p>They did not make it there until 3am, after cramming ice baths, recovery, a condensed media conference and a celebration for Rob Simmons's 100th Test into the shortest possible time after the game.</p><p>\"It was quite hectic. Looking back it was pretty funny,\" vice-captain Samu Kerevi said. \"We had music jamming, guys were watching Netflix, some guys were sleeping, some guys were eating. It was raining pretty hard, we put the windows down and tried to taste the rain. It was an awesome trip.</p><p>\"We can't complain, these things are uncontrollable. I thought the staff did really well to organise all this. They worked tirelessly around the clock for us.</p><p>\"There's no complaint from the boys, we understand you can't tell a typhoon to go away. It was all good from us, got on to the bus, the boys were throwing jokes, just trying to make the bus trip really exciting. But halfway through guys were out on their feet, just sleeping, just really tired. We are happy to be here and safe.\"</p><p>While the Wallabies will wait out the storm in relatively comfortable surrounds, Japan and Scotland still remain uncertain whether their final pool match will go ahead on Sunday. World Rugby will make a decision on the morning of the match after assessing the amount of rain and damage the typhoon has left behind.</p><p>The curve ball for the Wallabies has delayed their journey to Oita until midweek but mirrors England's move back to their pre-tournament base in beachside Miyazaki after their pool match against France was called off.</p><p>The Wallabies were finding plenty of solace in the fact they were back in a familiar and fondly-remembered spot.</p><p>\"This is the perfect place for us to be at the moment, in terms of our familiarity. This is basically home for us, being here is awesome,\" Kerevi said. \"The facilities are awesome, the rooms, we've got our gym in the hotel, so in terms of that, travel is minimised besides going to the fields. Our recovery is here, I think that was the biggest one for us, minimising our travel time in terms of between training sessions. Being able to go one bus out to training and still get our sleep in, our recovery.</p><p>\"The food here is awesome, the staff here are awesome. We couldn't have had it any better.\"</p><p>The physical distance between the two sides could cool the adversarial dynamic already developing between the coaches late last week.</p><p>Michael Cheika didn't miss an opportunity to remind Eddie Jones, his former Randwick teammate, that Jones - in what increasingly looked like a poor choice of words - suggested the \"typhoon gods\" were smiling on him.</p><p>\"I saw he was saying that [not playing France] would be an advantage and the typhoon gods were smiling on him,\" Cheika said. \"So I suppose they'd better win. They've had the best preparation, according to the coach, so they'd better go out there and win. If that's the best possible preparation. We'll see how we go.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520192549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X80-TTG1-DY19-C52X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><timeReceived>05:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I'm looking forward to another week of really tough tussles at training and see what happens come the weekend because the guys who were in the back three positions over the last three games have played really well.\" The Hodge case was the precedent for a game-changing blitz on high, dangerous or head-glancing jolts at the World Cup which Irish great-turned-TV pundit Brian O'Driscoll distilled as \"the big hit is gone.\" Hodge didn't believe he needed radical surgery on his tackling technique when the net caught Samoan hooker Seilala Lam for a yellow card for a strong front-on shot on dipping Irish winger Jacob Stockdale on Saturday.</p><p>\"My kind of tackling in the wide channels is always in the low knee-to-hip kind of region and I learnt my lesson that it is going to be quite harsh if you stray,\" he said.</p><p>Prop James Slipper shared in tight, winning Cup quarter-finals in 2011 and 2015 and said the zealous work put in on scrums, lineouts and mauling all year was the key to another on Saturday.</p><p>FIVE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNT ABOUT THE WALLABIES FOR QUARTER-FINAL WEEK 1 Beware a terminal red or yellow card. Isi Naisarani's yellow for an accidental jaw bump in a clean-out against Georgia on Friday night was the 28th card (27 yellow and one red) against the Wallabies since the 2015 Rugby World Cup. No other top nation has given away that many so, yes, discipline is a finger-crossing, toe-crossing lottery.</p><p>2 Start matches at halftime. The Wallabies are stronger finishers with a collective 87-25 edge in second- half play against Fiji, Wales, Uruguay and Georgia. It reflects fitness gains, some excellent super-sub efforts from Matt Toomua, Will Genia and co, too many errors early in games and adapting with some good halftime chat.</p><p>3 The Wallabies are going to run. They will back their high-passing game but a little less of the dumb stuff please. Why you'd try to run out of your quarter in the wet against Georgia and have hooker Tolu Latu knock on in front of the posts is beyond us. Find the right balance. More ball to Marika Koroibete. His solo try against Georgia was a dazzler.</p><p>4 The forwards can go toe-to-toe with England. There have been huge gains at the lineout. Lock Izack Rodda stole three Georgian lineouts and Latu is nailing long throws which means a great platform to run a tricky set play attack from. Scrum \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 rock solid.</p><p>5 Goalkicking. England's Owen Farrell just wins it if it comes down to a tight duel of penalty goals in the final 15 minutes. Christian Lealiifano, Matt Toomua and Reece Hodge have to somehow muster a 75 per cent success rate between them. Now or never.COMPILED BY JIM TUCKER</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-2586b45ced8311e99c8f7b18c72f0569d867a663f573aeafffb3faac653ffec9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-81B1-JD3N-5349-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>CourierMail4 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Gaming &amp; Lotteries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzJGRTBFOEMyOENBNDQ5MTg1NTA2NDdFQjhCNzhERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFMDdFQkREMkFENDRFMEFGRkJEQ0E4OTg1NEM5RTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Gaming &amp; Lotteries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzJGRTBFOEMyOENBNDQ5MTg1NTA2NDdFQjhCNzhERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFMDdFQkREMkFENDRFMEFGRkJEQ0E4OTg1NEM5RTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001003</classCode><className>LANDSLIDES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

If matches are cancelled, both sides receive two points each.</p><p>The group's chief organiser Warren Livingstone said he was concerned by the forecasts but noted there was not much travellers could do until the typhoon either strikes or misses Japan completely.</p><p>\"Our message at this stage is to hang tight and we'll know more soon,\" Livingstone said. \"We're still very hopeful the Australian games will go on but we're not sure about the others on the Saturday and the Sunday depending on the weather.\"</p><p>Gullivers Sport Travel, another Australian group, are about halfway through their 80 tour groups that have come over for the World Cup.</p><p>\"We've got about 700 people at the moment that are halfway through their itinerary and then others who get in Thursday, Friday and Saturday, so it depends what the airlines do,\" said managing director Ken Grover. \"The issue will be if flights are cancelled and all flights up here are full ??? there could be a knock-on effect.</p><p>\"We have groups on the bullet train but if it's so severe they could just shut it down. Where it is difficult is if you have a group in Osaka and they can't move on.</p><p>\"The plus is they're used to it in Japan and quite organised. One thing about typhoons is they seem to pass reasonably quickly. It's not like a slow storm that can go on for a while.

Starting with Hodge himself.</p><p>Australia live in envy of the money Eddie Jones is able to lavish on his side, although somehow the RFU, through its new stand at Twickenham and overindulging its elite level, has managed to get itself into debt.</p><p>Exactly how much England have spent on preparing for this World Cup no one really knows but it would easily be far more than any of the other 19 teams at this tournament.</p><p>Were they to lose on the weekend, it would trigger, at very least, a considerable amount of head-scratching, wondering how on earth England was eliminated without firing a shot.</p><p>All of which has made the England camp utterly determined that a team it has beaten on all six occasions they have met during the Jones era will not bring it down here in Oita.</p><p>Their first element of concern - given the absolutely central role match officials have played in this tournament - was the selection of Jerome Garces of France as the quarter-final referee.</p><p>Australians have fared less than well under French referees at this World Cup but it was with Garces in charge in Perth that the Wallabies reached the zenith of their form over the past four years, with the 47-26 record win over the All Blacks.</p><p>That he has been appointed to this match would be seen as a reassuring element for the Australians.</p><p>England's second concern is that they consider the Wallabies to be a very clever team, which perhaps brings us to a third concern - out-of-date intelligence. Once, for example, when John Mitchell was coach of the All Blacks - and, ironically, his current boss Eddie Jones, was coach of Australia - that might have been true. Now, it is certainly not so evident.</p><p>\"The first thing that we acknowledge is that the Wallabies are a very clever football team,\" Mitchell said.</p><p>\"They will be clever on the weekend. They are always clever and always have the ability to surprise. They love ball in their hands which is something they thrive on.\" Spoken like a former All Blacks coach who apparently still can't get the vision out of his brain of Stirling Mortlock rushing up to intercept Carlos Spencer's long pass and racing away for the try which completely changed the 2003 World Cup semi-final.</p><p>Far from ridiculing Michael Cheika for berating his assistant coaches about spending too much time looking at tapes of the opposition, Mitchell saw the value in concentrating on his own team.</p><p>\"I understand that comment,\" he said. \"It is important to focus on your strength but part of any game plan is you have also got to look at what you can take away from the opposition as well, because that creates pressure. Creating pressure also creates opportunities, which is what you are after. But first and foremost, you should focus on yourself.\" In that light, Mitchell delivered a promising fitness report on injured England No 8 Billy Vunipola, suggesting it was \"very likely\" that he would overcome his ankle injury and take his place in the side.\"He is a very important player to us and a very likeable player as well. He fits well within the team.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-bf0ca67aef2411e99457e30331e776c723fa5c224096a194cfd58813156cc560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-6FP1-F0JP-W1JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000741</classCode><className>REFEREES &amp; UMPIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DHVB</classCode><className>SPORTS OFFICIATING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX017</classCode><className>PERTH, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC337</classCode><className>ARGENTINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Sydney's eastern suburbs.</p><p>In Murray's sights* is a swath of the Sydney Harbour National Park near Watsons Bay, land businessman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Christopher Drivas</emphasis> had previously proposed to turn into a function centre.</p><p>Drivas quickly learnt that any development opposed by the Watsons Bay Association ?????? which opposes virtually everything ?????? doesn't get very far. By last December, his plan was dead.</p><p>But Murray is keen to have a crack and this year discussed his ideas with several people including Liberal MP <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dave Sharma</emphasis> and Vantage Asset Management chairman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rod McGeoch</emphasis>, recently reappointed to the SCG Trust.</p><p>It's unclear exactly what Murray ?????? who has registered a new corporate vehicle called Nature Walks as part of the project ?????? wants to do with the South Head site.</p><p>CBD was told much of the discussion concerns a free three-kilometre pathway in the areathat wraps around from Gap Bluff to the Hornby Lighthouse.</p><p>People close to Murray say his plans for South Head, if they come good, would finally make the area wheelchair accessible. We're sure these plans have nothing to do with the eight lucrative buildings in the precinct that the government had hoped to lease for 40 years.</p><p>All this would be a departure from Murray's previous attempts at landscaping. Earlier this year he made the news in London for refusing to pay a gardener for work he didn't like, instead telling him to \"sue me, you prick\". The gardener called his bluff and Murray was forced to pay ??24,000 ($45,000).</p><p>*Not recommended: several years ago Murray was photographed in front of a dead lion and a dead elephant, although he later had a change of heart and vowed to save rhinos from poachers.</p><p>PUPLICK BAGGING</p><p>How good are failed Liberal politicians plucked from obscurity and handed a comfortable sinecure inside the Administrative Appeals Tribunal despite their lack of legal experience?</p><p>Not very, it turns out. Don't take our word for it ?????? just ask Federal Court judge <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wendy Abraham</emphasis>.</p><p>Former Liberal senator <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Puplick</emphasis> was appointed to the AAT in November 2017 by (then) Liberal senator George Brandis. (But of course he did, and thanks for the $300,000 salary).</p><p>For the record, the Herald reported last month that Puplick resigned as NSW Anti-Discrimination Board president and as NSW Privacy commissioner in 2003 after being investigated for improperly acting on behalf a friend in a discrimination case.</p><p>Which brings us to the present day and the matter of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paramjeet Singh</emphasis>, an Indian citizen who had his permanent visa cancelled for a domestic assault and found himself before Puplick at the AAT.</p><p>Justice Abraham on Friday found Puplick's decision not to overturn the cancellation was \"irrational and illogical\". Puplick doesn't have any legal qualifications. It seems he also can't use a calendar.</p><p>It turns out Puplick's mistakenly believed that Singh was given a series of warnings not to reoffend, gave a commitment he wouldn't, then went on to commit another crime.</p><p>Singh didn't commit a crime after the warnings, it turned out. Puplick was just dead wrong.</p><p>Singh's matter is heading back to the AAT (and, perhaps, another former Liberal MP).</p><p>LUCK OF THE IRISH</p><p>Australia's sporting delegation at the Rugby World Cup spent the weekend holed up in Japan's Shizuoka Prefecture as Typhoon Hagibis wreaked havoc with travel plans.</p><p>Rugby Australia chairman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Clyne</emphasis> was there, flying the flag for an absent chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raelene Castle</emphasis>, as the Wallabies took on Georgia at Fukuroi's Ecopa Stadium on Friday night.</p><p>Officials included Australian Olympic Committee chief <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt Carroll</emphasis>, Melbourne Rebels chairman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Docherty</emphasis> and Victorian Sports Minister <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Martin Pakula</emphasis>.</p><p>The victorious Wallabies managed to fly out on Saturday morning but Clyne's Rugby Australia contingent was not so lucky and was forced to wait until after Hagibis made landfall.</p><p>Clyne, a former National Australia Bank boss, lead the contingent to a Fukuroi Irish bar on Sunday to wait out the weather with a flight out booked for Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520192778</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-SGG1-JBJ7-N49P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>01:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They're the best!</p><p>No one wants to play the All Blacks until they reach the final and even then you would be hoping some other team would do you a favour and upset the Kiwis in the quarter-final or the semi-final, as has happened in the past.</p><p>The All Blacks have won a record three World Cups.</p><p>Interestingly, three of the other five tournaments have been won by teams that managed to avoid the Kiwis.</p><p>Only the Wallabies in 1991 (semi-final) and South Africa in 1995 (final) have had to beat the All Blacks to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.</p><p>The England soccer team rested key players for their final pool game against Belgium at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p><p>The English lost 1-0 but managed to reach the semi-finals for the first time in 28 years.</p><p>That may have justified the tactic in the minds of the English and French rugby teams but for me it is just another form of tanking, which occurs in the AFL and some American sporting competitions such as the NBA.</p><p>In those sports teams have been known to give games away so they finish lower on the table to get a higher draft pick.</p><p>In other words, they deliberately lose to gain an advantage. Same thing, isn't it?</p><p>We will never know whether England or France intended to tank or not but now the issue has been raised it is something World Rugby needs to address.</p><p>Some might argue that engineering results is a natural part of tournament play but I do not subscribe to that theory.</p><p>Call me old-fashioned but it is not in the spirit of rugby.</p><p>Any team that deliberately throws a game at a Rugby World Cup should be punished with heavy fines and suspensions.</p><p>Let's hope we never see it.</p><p>Who would the Wallabies have preferred to play in the quarter-final? England or France?</p><p>You would probably say France but not with any real conviction. Under Michael Cheika, the Wallabies beat England in the pool stage of the 2015 World Cup but since then Australia have lost six Tests in a row to the English, all of them with that tricky little fellow, Eddie Jones, as coach.</p><p>In the same period the Wallabies have split two Tests with France, both in Paris, suggesting they would have had more chance of defeating Les Bleus.</p><p>Neither England nor France have performed all that impressively at this World Cup so far.</p><p>At least with England you know what you are getting.</p><p>Les Bleus are reportedly in turmoil at the moment after a falling-out between the coaching staff and captain Guilhem Guirado. There have been calls for a French revolution. It's times like this when Les Bleus are at their most dangerous.</p><p>Remember their 2011 World Cup campaign when the players revolted against coach Marc Lievremont and reached the final, losing to the All Blacks 8-7 at Eden Park.That's the problem with the French, you would never know if they were tanking or not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-489c6d00ebef11e99d70460943e0caa2ccb1737904054a3abc3090aa6d924940</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-9PB1-F0JP-W26K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFRX</classCode><className>FIFA WORLD CUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001587</classCode><className>SOCCER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GC314</classCode><className>BELGIUM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

By last December, his plan was dead.</p><p>But Murray is keen to have a crack and this year discussed his ideas with several people including Liberal MP Dave Sharma and Vantage Asset Management chairman Rod McGeoch, recently reappointed to the SCG Trust.</p><p>It's unclear exactly what Murray - who has registered a new corporate vehicle called Nature Walks as part of the project - wants to do with the South Head site.</p><p>CBD was told much of the discussion concerns a free three-kilometre pathway in the area that wraps around from Gap Bluff to the Hornby Lighthouse.</p><p>People close to Murray say his plans for South Head, if they come good, would finally make the area wheelchair accessible. We're sure these plans have nothing to do with the eight lucrative buildings in the precinct that the government had hoped to lease for 40 years.</p><p>All this would be a departure from Murray's previous attempts at landscaping. Earlier this year he made the news in London for refusing to pay a gardener for work he didn't like, instead telling him to \"sue me, you prick\". The gardener called his bluff and Murray was forced to pay \u00a324,000 ($45,000).</p><p>* Not recommended: several years ago Murray was photographed in front of a dead lion and a dead elephant, although he later had a change of heart and vowed to save rhinos from poachers.</p><p>PUPLICK BAGGING</p><p>How good are failed Liberal politicians plucked from obscurity and handed a comfortable sinecure inside the Administrative Appeals Tribunal despite their lack of legal experience?</p><p>Not very, it turns out. Don't take our word for it - just ask Federal Court judge Wendy Abraham.</p><p>Former Liberal senator Chris Puplick was appointed to the AAT in November 2017 by (then) Liberal senator George Brandis. (But of course he did, and thanks for the $300,000 salary).</p><p>For the record, the Herald reported last month that Puplick resigned as NSW Anti-Discrimination Board president and as NSW Privacy commissioner in 2003 after being investigated for improperly acting on behalf a friend in a discrimination case.</p><p>Which brings us to the present day and the matter of Paramjeet Singh, an Indian citizen who had his permanent visa cancelled for a domestic assault and found himself before Puplick at the AAT.</p><p>Justice Abraham on Friday found Puplick's decision not to overturn the cancellation was \"irrational and illogical\". Puplick doesn't have any legal qualifications. It seems he also can't use a calendar.</p><p>It turns out that Puplick mistakenly believed that Singh was given a series of warnings not to reoffend, gave a commitment he wouldn't, then went on to commit another crime.</p><p>Singh didn't commit a crime after the warnings, it turned out. Puplick was just dead wrong.</p><p>Singh's matter is heading back to the AAT (and, perhaps, another former Liberal MP).</p><p>LUCK OF THE IRISH</p><p>Australia's sporting delegation at the Rugby World Cup spent the weekend holed up in Japan's Shizuoka Prefecture as Typhoon Hagibis wreaked havoc with travel plans.</p><p>Rugby Australia chairman Cameron Clyne was there, flying the flag for an absent chief executive Raelene Castle, as the Wallabies took on Georgia at Fukuroi's Ecopa Stadium on Friday night.</p><p>Officials included the Australian Olympic Committee chief Matt Carroll, Melbourne Rebels chairman Paul Docherty and the Victorian Sports Minister Martin Pakula.</p><p>The victorious Wallabies managed to fly out on Saturday morning but Clyne's Rugby Australia contingent was not so lucky and was forced to wait until after Hagibis made landfall.</p><p>Clyne, a former National Australia Bank boss, led the contingent to a Fukuroi Irish bar yesterday to wait out the wild weather with a flight out booked for the group today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77isj11tgas152gjmf10</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-K6C1-JD34-V1GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

While the rest of the rugby world coiled itself in knots over whether or not the game would, or could, be played, the death toll climbed into the dozens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The typhoon affected so many people and there were some casualties. Although we really wanted to clear the game, we couldn't make a decision by ourselves, for our sakes,\" Japan's loosehead prop, Keita Inagaki said.</p><p>\"When we were told the game would be played we thought this was an opportunity to energise, revitalise the Japanese people and also the victims, those who lost people. As rugby players we thought this was something we thought we could do. As a result we won the game and we thought this could be an opportunity for us to give courage to people who were affected by the typhoon.\"</p><p>Inagaki is the mop-haired prop whose support play finished off one of the most exquisite tries seen at this World Cup. Attacking, up-tempo rugby at its best, the Brave Blossoms showed what magic can happen when you keep the ball alive. As the roars grew ever louder at Yokohama International Stadium, their daring breathed the Yokohama and Tokyo communities back to life.</p><p>\"It was the best feeling I could ever have,\" a solemn and emotional Inagaki said. \"Everyone was under pressure because the game was in Japan, but because it was held in Japan I thought we could enjoy this loud crowd. Despite the weather, despite the typhoon, we could make this happen. I'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the staff members who made it happen.\"</p><p>Two Australians were also part of Japan's 28-21 win, which sealed their spot in the World Cup knockout rounds for the first time. Former North Queensland Cowboys and Western Force back Will Tupou wore the No.15 jersey, and James Moore started in the second row. Both came out of Brisbane State High School, and plied their trade in the Top League before being picked for the Sunwolves and qualifying for the Brave Blossoms under World Rugby's three-year residency rule.</p><p>Just like their coaches, New Zealanders Jamie Joseph, Tony Brown and Scott Hansen, Tupou and Moore showed what commitment to a common cause could produce.</p><p>\"I am from Australia but I am proud to wear the Japanjersey and we are thankful for the fans,\" Tupou said. \"I never thought I would be in Japan for this long and to have this opportunity to play in a World Cup team for Japan. I am so glad I stayed a bit longer.\"</p><p>By Sunday, the death toll from Hagibis had climbed past 30. Japan paid tribute to the stricken families and communities before turning their attention to a quarter-final clash with South Africa at Tokyo Stadium.</p><p>The teams met in a World Cup warm up and the Springboks smashed the Blossoms 41-7. Although their rise from tier-two surprise packets to World Cup contenders can be traced back to the 2015 upset between the two nations, last month's loss will be the more relevant touchstone.</p><p>\"We faced them two weeks before the World Cup and were pretty poor. We need to try to take something from that,\" Moore said. \"We had a couple of beers in the changing room and the guys won't go out tonight. It's chill and focus on South Africa.\"</p><p>In an indication of how much the squad put into Sunday's game, captain Michael Leitch did not know who they would play in the quarter-final. His coach knew the permutations, however, and the staff were already plotting Japan's fourth major World Cup scalp.</p><p>They will have to drown out what Joseph calls the \"noise\" around his team. \"Walking into a hotel with people clapping ... It's a bit different, especially for me, from a small village in New Zealand,\" Joseph said. \"If we are honest, we need to limit it as much as possible. We understand we are representing the nation and the players are buying into it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77j1rsx148yq1igijkx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-K6C1-JD34-V1K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Sometimes it is to their detriment.</p><p>According to numbers from ESPN and the Rugby World Cup website, put together and shared this week by stats man Russ Petty, the Wallabies have averaged 14 kicks a game this year and 13 a match at the World Cup.</p><p>In this cycle, Australia have kicked less than any other team.</p><p>Teams ranked higher than Australia, such as New Zealand (21 kicks a game at the World Cup), England (29), Ireland (26), South Africa (26) and Wales (23) have a far more tactical kicking game.</p><p>Aside from the All Blacks, the others are renowned for implementing a lower-risk, territory-based style - to a certain extent - in which they want to operate at the other end of the field.</p><p>The number of Australian kicks a game has been reasonably consistent each year since the last World Cup. Therefore, this means the Wallabies have had more possession than most sides.</p><p>They have made more runs (157) a game than any other side at the World Cup for an average of 3.5 metres per carry and the fewest tackles a match (87).</p><p>Of the eight remaining teams in the quarter-finals, Australia (3.5 metres) sit seventh when it comes to metres gained per run. They are ahead of Ireland (2.8 metres), but lagging behind New Zealand (4.5) and England (4.3). However, Australia have more success than any other team in getting over the gain line (41 per cent of carries), ahead of New Zealand (40 per cent), England (39 per cent) and Wales (31 per cent), ranked last of the teams remaining at the World Cup.</p><p>As a rule, the amount of ball in hand is going to correlate with a higher number of turnovers. The exception is a team such as Ireland, who have excellent ball security but traditionally a less expansive attacking game than a side like the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia have turned the ball over more times than any tier-one team in 2019, doing so 19 times a game. That is an increase on 2016 (16), as well as 2017 and 2018 (both 15).</p><p>At the World Cup, the men in gold are coughing up the ball 17 times on average a game, on the higher end of the spectrum for top teams.</p><p>Statistics show limiting turnovers is of paramount importance.</p><p>When Australia have a low error count they have shown - as they did in Perth during a record-breaking 47-26 victory over the All Blacks in August - they will inevitably beat more defenders and score more tries. That night there were 14 turnovers; their equal lowest this year.</p><p>In total this year, the Wallabies have turned the ball over 168 times, while their opponents have done so on 116 occasions.</p><p>With ball in hand, the Wallabies are evasive. In 2019, Australia are ranked second behind New Zealand when it comes to the number of defenders beaten in each match.</p><p>Discipline has been a problem for the Wallabies and, yet, while Australia have received three yellow cards at the World Cup - only Samoa have been given more - their overall penalty count is not disproportionate with other top ranking teams, despite being on the higher side.</p><p>Australia's nine penalties per game is on par with Wales and slightly more than England, Ireland and South Africa (all with an average of seven).</p><p>When comparing Australia to England throughout 2019, given the latter have had a relatively light run thus far at the World Cup after their France fixture was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Eddie Jones' side has scored more tries (4.7 to 3.9) and kicked in play more than double the amount the Wallabies have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77k345x67r6juw592vt</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8W-HGW1-F0J6-J1BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001452</classCode><className>RANKINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

So it has always been an advantage to be tall in rugby - until now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Suddenly, as World Rugby launches its blitz on head-high tackling it is the taller players, those who stretch the tape out 2m or more, who are coming more and more under scrutiny. Last weekend, Australians Adam Coleman (204cm) and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (198cm) and Argentinian lock Tomas Lavanini (201cm), all found themselves carded for high shots.</p><p>It's just what comes naturally when a player is so tall. While a shorter player like, for instance, David Pocock, admits he naturally tackles around the chest, it is particularly difficult for the basketball types, particularly when the ball-carrier ducks - as you tend to do when you are about to be monstered by someone that imposing.</p><p>Now Rory Arnold, who at 208cm takes \"tall, dark and handsome\" to ridiculous extremes, is beginning to realise that his imposing physique has become a liability. He was given a foretaste of it last year, when he was suspended for three matches for a high shot on Lions five-eighth Elton Jantjes in Johannesburg and while he has managed to escape censure this season, there certainly have been a couple of close calls.</p><p>Finally, Wallabies coach -Michael Cheika has recognised publicly what he must have -realised privately all along, that his team, while trained to tackle around the midriff, was consistently straying high.</p><p>\"No matter how you see the pictures, the penalties are real,\" said Cheika. \"You've got to do something because, whether it's truth or perception, we're getting the arm raised against us and we're losing blokes to the bin. So we have to improve the tackle area as a whole.\" Arnold admits he has been working on the tackling problem for some time. \"It is a point in my game that I have to think about a bit,\" he said. \"Over the past few weeks, there have been a lot of cards thrown out there and it puts a lot of pressure on your side \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 playing with 14 blokes for a while.\" Most critics would be suggesting that the Wallabies simply have to tackle lower, and there certainly is a case to be made for that based on how Japan are defending at this World Cup. They have been exemplary as they have cut players down. But they are merely making a virtue of necessity. They do not have the big men, therefore coach Jamie Joseph has cut their cloth accordingly.</p><p>But the Wallabies have brought one of the most formidable teams to the World Cup and they want to make the most of their physicality. Coleman emphasised that point against Uruguay last weekend in Oita as he effectively frogmarched the opposition's No 8 Manuel Diana 10m down the field after wrapping him up in a high but legal tackle.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, I want to play aggressively,\" said Arnold. \"That's the way I play. I guess it is mainly those taller boys who are getting pinged for the high shots. As locks and taller men, we have to focus on getting our shots down. Because at the end of the day there is no contact with the head and it's about player safety.</p><p>\"Player safety is the most important thing. It is up to us to get our tackles down and keep working on that.\" The storm of controversy over tackling is taking place against the background of a real storm, as Super Typhoon Hagibis bears down on the Japanese islands. It has been rated \"the strongest storm on the planet\" at present, -although it is difficult for the people of Tokyo to take it seriously as they basked on Wednesday in a picture-postcard day. Besides, there are, on average, 19 typhoons per season and most of them amount to very little.But if Hagibis does bear down on Yokohama this weekend, it could impact on the England-France clash on Saturday to decide Pool C and Sunday's Japan-Scotland match to determine Pool A. In the event of a washout, which would then give two points to each side, England, not France, would be confirmed as Australia's quarter-final opponents. But it could prove a godsend to Japan, allowing them to move into the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-3b8d03f8ea6511e9a044e49bf0c4e438ce81b045a3ec5913997d6c5014660b53</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7D-CBG1-JD3N-536M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000171</classCode><className>BASKETBALL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It is not uncommon for school hierarchy to placate parental complaints to the abandonment of the teacher.</p><p>Teachers are aware that any grievance will be viewed as a weakness. Yes, I generalise, but schools where principals offer adequate support maintain a less stressful environment.</p><p>Barry McArthur, Wangaratta</p><p>Extra hands welcome IT was extremely disturbing to read about the growing numbers of teachers becoming overwhelmed by difficult classroom behaviours.</p><p>Much smaller class sizes and a significant increase in the number of teacher aides in each classroom would be two positive steps that could be immediately taken.</p><p>Robert Van Zetten, Highton</p><p>Our democratic right SPEAKING of the Extinction Rebellion protests, the Sunday Herald Sun (Editorial, 13/10) refers to protest as a \"privilege\", not a \"right\".</p><p>Certainly, that is an authoritarian view; not a liberal or democratic one. The Liberals (and parts of the Labor Party) are abandoning liberal and democratic values in a race to the bottom on human rights.</p><p>Civil disobedience, equally, is a factor in liberal democracies. Think of the anti-segregation movement in America. The pro-segregation authorities there also did not see protest as a human right. In such situations, it is not the right move to escalate things with jail terms, massive fines and the like.</p><p>The government (and it seems the Herald Sun) is pushing a view that would nullify our credibility and standing as a true liberal democracy.</p><p>Tristan Ewins, Box Hill North</p><p>All in this together PETA Credlin (Opinion, 13/10) was barely a toddler when the Vietnam moratorium marches took Australia by storm, leading to political change and the withdrawal of our troops.</p><p>It's a safe bet some of those long-haired, youthful protesters are now among the esteemed ranks of fireys and Rotarians.</p><p>It's Credlin who seeks to divide us by suggesting today's protesters don't and won't contribute to society. I'm not convinced of their methods but I am convinced of their cause. At least they are engaged with their future, unlike so many whose lives seem to revolve around shallow pursuits.</p><p>Joan Reilly, Surrey Hills</p><p>Selective governance COME on, Peta. You are better than that diatribe you unleashed on protesters (Opinion, 13/10). I agree the protests can be frustrating to deal with, however there is no suggestion from anyone that understands the science that our dramatically changing climate \"causes bushfires or the drought\".</p><p>Our fossil fuel-driven warming planet is increasing the amount of energy being absorbed into the major climate biomes. The result is higher evaporation and much lower ground moisture content on land when drought occurs. Listen to our farmers, they will tell you they have never seen anything like it before.</p><p>Conversely, warming seas create more powerful low-pressure storms by warming the air above them, compounding the greenhouse effect.</p><p>This month's Typhoon Hagibis in Japan is just one example of the gradual worsening of catastrophic weather events, not \"caused\" by climate change but intensified by it.</p><p>In Australia, we are witnessing bushfires at a new level of intensity, far earlier in the year and burning into our rainforest. This is a new and worrying development beyond the understanding of the leadership of both major political parties, it would seem.</p><p>This selective, wilful ignorance is the reason behind the protests. John White, Burwood East</p><p>A house divided I AGREE with Peta Credlin that \"we're creating two Australias\" (Opinion, 13/10). Sadly, she focuses on symptoms rather than causes as she typically lashes out with her pet ideological obsession of blaming \"the hard Left\".</p><p>The real divide in Australian society is the ever-expanding gap between the haves and have nots in property ownership, brought on by excessively generous tax breaks on property ownership.</p><p>Fr Kevin Burke, Sandringham</p><p>Coo-ee, learn this SO evidently our new arrivals are struggling with the lingo.

Andso it was very interesting to see Elliottmakean appearance at theMRC'smarquee luncheon for the Caulfield Guineas event on Saturday. Lunch guests say that Elliott and Blanksby kept their distance while everyone else was on best behaviour.MRCchairman Peter LeGrandeven introduced his rival as his \"dear friend\".Also inside the committee room: Racing Victoria boss Giles Thompson, Tabcorp spinner and formerTonyAbbott staffer CharlesMoon, as well as federal LiberalMPTimWilson and newly minted Labor MacnamaraMPJosh Burns. They were joined by former Victorian premier Denis Napthine who spoke amicably with current Victorian Liberal Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien.Former Carlton coach Denis Pagan was also spotted along with Carlton chief executive Cain Liddle, Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains, and players including Essendon's JobeWatson, as well as former coach Kevin Sheedy.ACROSSTHEPACIFIC Across the Pacific, a sporting crowd of a different stripe spent the weekend holed up in Japan's Shizuoka Prefecture as Typhoon Hagibis which wreaked havoc with travel plans. </p><p>Rugby Australia chairmanCameronClyneflewthe flag for an absent chief executive Raelene Castle by leading an officialRAfunction at the Wallabies match against Georgia at Fukuroi's ECOPAstadium on Friday night.Officials at the function included Australian Olympic Committee chief executive Matt Carroll, Melbourne Rebels chairman Paul Docherty, Rebels chief executive BadenStephenson and Victorian Sports Minister (and Carlton supporter) Martin Pakula.The Wallabies eventually took out the match to score a berth in the WorldCupquarter-finals. The jubilant teamflew out on Saturday morning but the Rugby Australian contingent including Clyne weren't so lucky and had to wait until after Hagibismadelandfall.Clyne, a former National Australia Bank boss, lead the contingent to a Fukuroi Irish bar yesterday to wait out the weather with a flight out booked for today.Wewish them well.BACKTOBUSINESS Pakula got out on time, however.Watching the clouds roll in as the typhoon boredownacross Fukuroi, he \"hot-footed it\" out of nearby Hamamatsuon Friday night to avoid the super-storm.There were other pressing events to attend to. Victoria's Minister for Fun had a meeting scheduled for yesterday morning with Australian Grand Prix Corporation boss AndrewWestacott and Formula OneGroup chief executive Chase Carey.(Rugby took up some of the conversation,wepresume. After all, the formerNewsCorp chief operating officer Carey was a onetimememberof Harvard's Business School Rugby Club.) Also present at the meeting?Newly appointed Australian Grand Prix Corporation andBRWRich Lister Paul Little, off to a literal flying start in thenewrole.Also on the schedule: a meet-andgreet with Carlton United Breweries'newoverlord, Asahi; Japan Post, which owns Toll Holdings; and Dulux owner Nippon Paint.After that, Pakula met with Mitsui, the Japanese conglomerate which used to ownthe nowshuttered Hazelwood power station.Perhaps to discuss happier times.ALLTHE QUALIFICATIONS Howgood are failed Liberal politicians plucked from obscurity and handed a comfortable sinecure inside the Administrative Appeals Tribunal despite their lack of legal experience?Not very, it turns out. Don't take our word for it - just ask Federal Court judgeWendyAbraham.Former Liberal senator Chris Puplick was appointed to theAAT in November 2017 by (then current) Liberal senator George Brandis.Wewould never question Puplick's fitness for the job butweshould point out he is one of about 10 million political appointments earning up to $360,000 a year on the tribunal.Andweshould also point out The Age reported last month that Puplick resigned asNSWAnti- Discrimination Board president and NSWPrivacy Commissioner in 2003 after allegations of improperly acting on behalf a friend in a discrimination case.Which brings us to the present day and the matter of Paramjeet Singh, an Indian citizenwhohad his permanent visa cancelled for a domestic assault and found himself before Puplick at theAAT.OnFriday, JusticeAbraham found Puplick's decision not to overturn the cancellation was \"irrational and illogical\". Puplick doesn't have any legal qualifications but it turns out he also can't use a calendar.Puplick mistakenly believed that Singh was given a series of warnings not to reoffend and gave a commitment he wouldn't. Singh was actually given the warnings after the assault, meaning Puplick's ruling needs to go back to theAATfor another go.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc77ii1ndue69mybx79it</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-M231-JD34-V185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

So it has always been an advantage to be tall in rugby - until now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Suddenly, as World Rugby launches its blitz on head-high tackling it is the taller players, those who stretch the tape out 2m or more, who are coming more and more under scrutiny. Last weekend, Australians Adam Coleman (204cm) and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (198cm) and Argentinian lock Tomas Lavanini (201cm), all found themselves carded for high shots.</p><p>It's just what comes naturally when a player is so tall. While a shorter player like, for instance, David Pocock, admits he naturally tackles around the chest, it is particularly difficult for the basketball types, particularly when the ball-carrier ducks - as you tend to do when you are about to be monstered by someone that imposing.</p><p>Now Rory Arnold, who at 208cm takes \"tall, dark and handsome\" to ridiculous extremes, is beginning to realise that his imposing physique has become a liability. He was given a foretaste of it last year, when he was suspended for three matches for a high shot on Lions five-eighth Elton Jantjes in Johannesburg and while he has managed to escape censure this season, there certainly have been a couple of close calls.</p><p>Finally, Wallabies coach -Michael Cheika has recognised publicly what he must have -realised privately all along, that his team, while trained to tackle around the midriff, was consistently straying high.</p><p>\"No matter how you see the pictures, the penalties are real,\" said Cheika. \"You've got to do something because, whether it's truth or perception, we're getting the arm raised against us and we're losing blokes to the bin. So we have to improve the tackle area as a whole.\" Arnold admits he has been working on the tackling problem for some time. \"It is a point in my game that I have to think about a bit,\" he said. \"Over the past few weeks, there have been a lot of cards thrown out there and it puts a lot of pressure on your side \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 playing with 14 blokes for a while.\" Most critics would be suggesting that the Wallabies simply have to tackle lower, and there certainly is a case to be made for that based on how Japan are defending at this World Cup. They have been exemplary as they have cut players down. But they are merely making a virtue of necessity. They do not have the big men, therefore coach Jamie Joseph has cut their cloth accordingly.</p><p>But the Wallabies have brought one of the most formidable teams to the World Cup and they want to make the most of their physicality. Coleman emphasised that point against Uruguay last weekend in Oita as he effectively frogmarched the opposition's No 8 Manuel Diana 10m down the field after wrapping him up in a high but legal tackle.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, I want to play aggressively,\" said Arnold. \"That's the way I play. I guess it is mainly those taller boys who are getting pinged for the high shots. As locks and taller men, we have to focus on getting our shots down. Because at the end of the day there is no contact with the head and it's about player safety.</p><p>\"Player safety is the most important thing. It is up to us to get our tackles down and keep working on that.\" The storm of controversy over tackling is taking place against the background of a real storm, as Super Typhoon Hagibis bears down on the Japanese islands. It has been rated \"the strongest storm on the planet\" at present, -although it is difficult for the people of Tokyo to take it seriously as they basked on Wednesday in a picture-postcard day. Besides, there are, on average, 19 typhoons per season and most of them amount to very little.But if Hagibis does bear down on Yokohama this weekend, it could impact on the England-France clash on Saturday to decide Pool C and Sunday's Japan-Scotland match to determine Pool A. In the event of a washout, which would then give two points to each side, England, not France, would be confirmed as Australia's quarter-final opponents. But it could prove a godsend to Japan, allowing them to move into the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-3b8d03f8ea6511e9a044e49bf0c4e43895d72886292ac04199030707e3f77ddc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7F-8JR1-JD3N-52D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000171</classCode><className>BASKETBALL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They've taken no notice.</p><p>Nor do they have an opinion of the watching brief World Rugby is keeping on the four games scheduled for Sunday, including the Japan-Scotland clash which essentially will determine the look and order of Pool A. Scotland, by the by, will be ruled out of the competition if the match is abandoned, which would be a cruel twist of fate for a team that already considers itself to have been robbed by Australia at the last World Cup. And all because of a typhoon dubbed \"Haggis\" by insiders.</p><p>No, the Wallabies have more important things to worry about. Like the two late changes in their match-day 23, with Adam Coleman and Michael Hooper both being scratched for \"niggles\". That threw the door open to Rob Simmons and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto to come into the reserves. It's a significant change because it now means that Simmons will get to play his 100th Test before this World Cup is over, which would have been no certainty otherwise. He will become the 11th Wallaby to reach this milestone and perhaps the one most underrated.</p><p>\"The Man from Theodore,\" David Pocock called him and certainly the traits they value in that part of Queensland 550-odd kilometres northwest of Brisbane - trust and dependability - are reflected in Simmons' rugby.</p><p>\"He has guided me on my football journey,\" said Test lock Izack Rodda, who studied the mysteries of lineouts at Simmons' feet in his early days at the Reds.</p><p>\"Great bloke. I'm happy for him and his family.\" Even though they cannot now miss out on the quarter-finals following Wales' defeat of Fiji, there is a mathematical chance that Australia could still emerge as winner of Pool D. All that is needed to that to occur is a Wallabies' win over Georgia. Oh, and for Uruguay to beat Wales.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, the Wallabies will finish second in Pool D regardless and will now meet England in the quarter-final in Oita next Saturday. Eddie Jones' side was spared the ordeal of playing France in Yokohama on Saturday to determine who would win Pool C. When the match was abandoned, both sides received two points, so it really was \"the blues\" for France. On the other hand, they might figure they have a better chance of getting past Wales than of beating a Wallabies outfit that has become as unpredictable as they are.</p><p>Pocock, who has taken over the captaincy for this match, had good reason to stress the importance of staying focused. The Georgians have never claimed a tier-one scalp and their Kiwi coach, Milton Haig, let it be known that the Australians would do nicely.</p><p>\"They've picked a pretty strong side,\" said Haig. \"It's similar to what played against Wales. We understand how difficult the job is going to be to create an upset but, again, this is a World Cup and it's sport and those types of things do happen in sport and everybody loves them.\" Michael Cheika has spoken glowingly about the competition for places in the Australian side but this is where the rubber meets the road - Pocock going head to head with fellow loose forwards Jack Dempsey and Isi Naisarani for two backrow spot once Hooper returns; Taniela Tupou gunning for a place in the quarter-final match day 23 currently occupied by Sekope Kepu, his roommate and mentor; Nic White trying to keep Will Genia at bay at halfback. And Matt Toomua will be attempting something that has so far proved impossible at this World Cup, getting picked at five-eighth for Australia two weeks running.</p><p>Cheika has gone out to the end of a very long limb in backing Kurtley Beale for the fullback position here but this surely is his last chance to play with real conviction. He always tends to play well in these matches, where the opposition might not be so well organised in defence, but it won't be Beale's attack that will be most harshly judged.</p><p>He needs the Georgians to bomb him like there is no tomorrow, and to take each high ball with aplomb - because that is exactly what England will do next week if he is selected.</p><p>GEORGIAON FRONT FOOT P30</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-35bd61feeb2611e9a044e49bf0c4e43880443da8266094d003d2c3ca6fc25388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-BGF1-F0JP-W04P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001423</classCode><className>POOL &amp; BILLIARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A3NR</classCode><className>SOCCER TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The editor states \" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Council would do well to start focusing on 'core council' issues rather than the apparent obsession with cutting the number of cars entering the CBD\".</p><p>Surely a burgeoning population and stagnant traffic congestion qualifies as a \"core council value\"?</p><p>Sure, cosmetic issues must be addressed but a visionary agenda for our city must be pursued.

Also, typhoons have decreased in frequency, not increased.</p><p>Yes, like Peta you are entitled to your say, but like many you do not appear to understand the term \"global\" in warming and climate change. If what you, and others say is the cause of warming, then you should be calling out China, India, Russia and other high emission-producing countries, because it is them, and not Australia, that are causing the problem.</p><p>Personally I am grateful to the Peta Credlins of the world who are unafraid to call out misinformation and hypocrisy when they see it.</p><p>Kerry Foley, Launceston, Tas</p><p>Now that's pressure SO, today's teens are feeling 'pressure' over Year 12 exams (\"Pleas for ATAR review to ease stress\", SHS, 20/10).</p><p>Didn't the late, great Keith Miller have the ultimate riposte to such claims in everyday life: \"Pressure is a Messerschmitt up your arse, playing cricket is not\".</p><p>And isn't the best preparation for such 'pressure' still 90 per cent of year 12 lessons being taught by teachers with a deep and broad knowledge of their year 12 subjects?

I believe we as adults let them down. I have had so many kids work-ready with very little chance of gaining employment.</p><p>As a retiree now, I see more anti-social behaviour from adults.

Widespread cancellations into and out of Japan are expected on Saturday.</p><p>Late on Friday Japan's national meteorological agency announced it could issue an emergency warning for the Tokai and Kanto regions, which takes in Tokyo, with record wind speeds and rainfall predicted to be on the same level of the 1958 Kanogawa Typhoon, which claimed 1200 lives.</p><p>The agency also warned the entire nation to be on the alert for violent winds, high waves, flooding in low-lying areas, swollen rivers and storm surges.</p><p>The updated weather mapping makes it almost certain that World Rugby will cancel some Sunday games, including host nation Japan's deciding blockbuster against Scotland in Yokohama.</p><p>Cancellation would see Scotland exit the competition at the group stages for only the second time in World Cup history. Cancelled pool games are declared nil-nil draws, with both teams awarded two points. In that scenario the standings would see Ireland and Japan advance.</p><p>The rapidly-evolving circumstances prompted a fiery response from both teams, including a threat of legal action against World Rugby.</p><p>\"We've had consistent dialogue in the last three or four days around this with senior people at World Rugby, but World Rugby seem to be determined to stick to its plan that the match is either played on Sunday or indeed it is cancelled, and to have it cancelled and have our ability to progress from this group put at peril, we believe is absolutely unacceptable,\" Scotland Rugby boss Mark Dodson told the BBC.</p><p>\"World Rugby is pointing us back to the participation agreement. We've had legal opinion - from a leading QC - that challenges World Rugby's interpretation.\"</p><p>World Rugby has cited tournament rules for its policy. The rules state if pool games cannot be played they be cancelled. But organisers have faced heavy criticism for talking about \"robust contingency plans\" in the lead-up to this weekend, before declaring on Thursday that they were not prepared to activate any, including moving or rescheduling games.</p><p>\"I think there's alternatives around Japan,\" Dodson said. \"The point to me, we are talking about now is not whether the game will take place on Sunday, that will be a purely meteorological issue. The issue will be if it can't take place then we're really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours later.\"</p><p>Japan coach Jamie Joseph also weighed in, criticising some media reporting for \"[undermining] the achievements of the Japanese team and significance of Sunday's match\".</p><p>\"Everyone in our squad wants to play. We've all earned the right to be considered one of the elite teams in the world. It's important for us to wake up on Monday morning and understand we're a worthy top-eight team, or we're not quite good enough,\" Joseph said.</p><p>\"The key difference here between us and Scotland is that we are driven and supported by the whole country. My team is motivated by achieving something that is great, and not [by] avoiding an embarrassment.\"</p><p>???Joseph said the Scotland game would be the biggest match in Japan rugby history. He said his players had to go out and \"earn a bit of respect\" by winning it.</p><p>The looming typhoon is also causing major headaches for Australian tourists and tour operators, who are being forced to change itineraries at short notice. With bullet trains cancelled on major routes in and out of Tokyo, bus operators have also been reluctant to take risks on the Saturday.</p><p>We Love Rugby tour leader Warren Livingstone said the process had been \"a nightmare ... it's been very difficult\", while Gullivers' Sports Travel boss Ken Grover said his company was trying to re-route 1000 people who had tickets to the cancelled England v France game in Yokohama on Saturday night.</p><p>\"People have asked can they get a refund and they'll go through the due process,\" Grover said.</p><p>\"We've arranged to send them [supporters at Wallabies game] early to Tokyo around lunchtime [on Saturday]. The issue that has complicated everything is they were on the Shinkansen (bullet train).</p><p>\"We're all on track for it, everyone is very cooperative they understand the situation.

Sometimes it is to their detriment.</p><p>According to numbers from ESPN and the Rugby World Cup website, put together and shared this week by rugby stats man Russ Petty, the Wallabies have averaged 14 kicks a game this year and 13 a match at the World Cup.</p><p>In this World Cup cycle, Australia have kicked less than any other team.</p><p>Teams ranked higher than Australia, such as New Zealand (21 kicks a game at the World Cup), England (29), Ireland (26), South Africa (26) and Wales (23) have a far more tactical kicking game.</p><p>Aside from the All Blacks, the others are renowned for implementing a lower-risk, territory-based style - to a certain extent - in which they want to operate at the other end of the field.</p><p>The number of Australian kicks a game has been reasonably consistent each year since the last World Cup. Therefore, this means the Wallabies have had more possession than most sides.</p><p>They have made more runs (157) a game than any other side at the World Cup for an average of 3.5 metres per carry and the fewest tackles a match (87).</p><p>Of the eight remaining teams in the quarter-finals, Australia (3.5 metres) sit seventh when it comes to metres gained per run. They are ahead of Ireland (2.8 metres), but lagging behind New Zealand (4.5) and England (4.3). Keep in mind the Wallabies, particularly in their past two matches against Uruguay and Georgia, have been picking and driving more often than normal, which brings that number down.</p><p>Tier 1 Average Match Stats 2016-19 <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>pic.twitter.com/NyvLPkwDLH</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>???

The exception is a team such as Ireland, who have excellent ball security but traditionally a less expansive attacking game than a side like the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia have turned the ball over more times than any tier-one team in 2019, doing so 19 times a game. That is an increase on 2016 (16), as well as 2017 and 2018 (both 15).</p><p>At the World Cup, the men in gold are coughing up the ball 17 times on average a game, on the higher end of the spectrum for top teams.</p><p>Statistics show limiting turnovers is of paramount importance for the Wallabies.</p><p>When Australia have a low error count they have shown - as they did in Perth during a record-breaking 47-26 victory over the All Blacks in August - they will inevitably beat more defenders and score more tries. That night there were 14 turnovers; their equal lowest this year.</p><p>In total this year, the Wallabies have turned the ball over 168 times, while their opponents have done so on 116 occasions.</p><p>With ball in hand, the Wallabies are evasive. In 2019, Australia are ranked second behind New Zealand when it comes to the number of defenders beaten in each match.</p><p>Discipline has been a problem for the Wallabies and, yet, while Australia have received three yellow cards at the World Cup - only Samoa have been given more - their overall penalty count is not disproportionate with other top ranking teams, despite being on the higher side.</p><p>Australia's nine penalties per game is on par with Wales and slightly more than England, Ireland and South Africa (all with an average of seven).</p><p>When comparing Australia to England throughout 2019, given the latter have had a relatively light run thus far at the World Cup after their France fixture was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Eddie Jones' side has scored more tries (4.7 to 3.9) and kicked in play more than double the amount the Wallabies have (30 times a game to 14).</p><p>Australia have offloaded more than England (10 times on average to nine) and made tackles at an equal success rate (85 per cent), but missed fewer (15 to 18) a game, which can be explained by their tactical plan to hold onto the ball.</p><p>Numbers won't mean much on Saturday when the two sides meet, but perhaps a surprise element might go a long way to getting the job done for two proud teams with plenty to prove.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520194135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-W841-DY19-C0HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><timeReceived>08:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

This kind of pressure has been ever-present during the Rugby World Cup 2019 in Japan. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Referees in particular felt the heat with the sport's global governing body <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.world.rugby\">World Rugby</url> making a statement criticising referee performances early on in the tournament for \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/rugby-world-cup-2019-referees-criticised-performance-reece-hodge-tackle-peceli-yato-a9117881.html\">not consistently being of the standard expected of the highest level of the game</url>\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Research into refereeing in rugby has highlighted the intense demand the role places on individuals, and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/tsp.2015-0109\">heavy psychological load</url> referees face. The result is poor psychological well-being and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/4/1/e000306\">poor mental health experiences</url>. The man who holds the world record for the most test matches refereed, Nigel Owens, recently gave a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ruck.co.uk/watch-there-was-a-lot-of-love-for-nigel-owens-following-his-ray-darcy-appearance/\">powerful interview</url> about his own struggles with mental health. </p><p>My current research explores chronic performance-related stress and failure-based depression experiences within elite referees. My early findings suggest that referees are feeling an ever-increasing psychological burden. This increase is associated with a constant exposure to psychological and physical intimidation through social and traditional media, and with it a perceived lack of game-wide support. </p><p>Referees are increasingly <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ijsmart.eu/Contents.aspx?Y=2016&amp;V=21&amp;Is=d\">walking away from the game</url> at all levels. Of increasing concern are the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/23750472.2019.1605841\">threats of verbal and physical violence that referees</url> are now facing. World-wide, referees are experiencing growing physical threat and psychological trauma. </p><p>Coaches are compelled to face the throngs of media after a match and expose themselves to scrutiny about the rights or wrongs of their team's performance. For many coaches, post-failure based depression is a reality. </p><p>But does it have to be this way? Australian coach Michael Cheika <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/michael-cheika-quits-rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-coach-latest-news-dave-rennie-a9163426.html\">left his post</url> of five years within 24 hours of his team's quarter-final loss to a disciplined and powerful England side. What was surprising about Cheika's response to questions was his call for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83S-4Gxk2Co\">\"compassion\"</url>.</p><p>Compassion is not a word commonly associated with sport at this level, yet this World Cup seems to have also shone a light on a side seldom seen in rugby - a display of humanity. This was evident in scenes of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/13/sport/canada-players-help-typhoon-rugby-world-cup-spt-intl-scli/index.html\">Canadian team helping a local community</url> clean up in Kamaishi in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis after the tropical cyclone caused their final match to be cancelled. </p><p>The footage helps us make sense of the role compassion can play in sport. Their emotional response to suffering and their authentic desire to help the citizens of Kamaishi showed a basic desire for a common humanity based on kindness, altruism and empathy.</p><p>Yet our sense of compassion seems to desert us when we enter the turnstiles, turn on the TV or flick the radio on. And this is particularly the case when we consider the referee caught in the middle.</p><p>I think it's time this changed.</p><h>Hard knocks</h><p>Rugby World Cup headlines also centred on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/50121693\">\"deselection\" of Jaco Peyper</url>, the South African referee who controlled the Wales quarter-final clash with France. Peyper got virtually every big call right during the match and has been one of the outstanding referees in the tournament. Yet he was reportedly dumped from a semi-final appointment for a photograph taken with Welsh fans at a train station. </p><p>Whatever the ethics of how the picture was taken, it should nevertheless invite us to focus our attention on the man in the middle.</p><p>In sport we seem to have allowed a vilification of the role of the referee to grow. We legitimise a non-compassionate view based on a lack of tolerance for anything that falls short of perfection.  </p><p>This was further highlighted last week when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/50121693\">South African fans</url> demanded the removal of referee Jerome Garces from the Springboks' semi-final with Wales. An       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.change.org/p/brett-gosper-stop-jerome-garces-give-us-nigel-owens?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_18547044_en-GB%253Av5&amp;recruiter=71497987&amp;recruited_by_id=66b87560-594f-11e3-9b07-d7c664d6ca07&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&amp;utm_term=795556e0ab504be99ba5aa2b96594d12&amp;share_bandit_exp=abi-18547044-en-GB&amp;share_bandit_var=v0\">online petition</url> was started to take the game away from the highly-rated French official.</p><p>For what? Because statistics demonstrate that South Africa has lost more games when he has been in charge. Of course he wasn't removed and the Springboks went on to win the match. Garces was appointed to control the final of the world cup. </p><p>Our immediate response to shout at a referee for what we consider to be a poor decision may be seen as acceptable - but taken to the extreme it is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/england-world-cup-semi-final-13024697\">referee and their family</url> being increasingly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/9718136/police-probe-death-threat-against-rugby-league-referee/\">trolled on social media</url> amid verbal threats of physical harm. </p><h>Where's the compassion?</h><p>Without a more compassionate response from the rugby community the game itself is at risk of harm. </p><p>The Rugby World Cup is not just about winning. It should also be a showcase of the positive qualities of the wider rugby community - including referees. After all, its primary purpose is to promote rugby to a wider audience as a game for all.  It will be a shame if this World Cup is remembered for failing to protect the mental health and well-being of its referees and, in doing so, turning potential recruits away from the job.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mikel Mellick does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-126045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD4-CWJ1-DXP7-11T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><timeReceived>10:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 31, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000741</classCode><className>REFEREES &amp;

Jones selected a back line he hoped would bludgeon the Wallabies in defence and rip them apart in attack. He backed his \"kamikaze kids\", back-rowers Tom Curry and Ben Underhill, to do a number on Australia's attacking breakdown.</p><p>But this week, for a change, he did not jump at the opportunity to get stuck into Cheika, a coach over whom he has enjoyed complete dominance since they took the reins at two of the great Test nations.</p><p>Starting with a 3-0 series win over Australia in 2016 and extending to three Tests at Twickenham in the three years since, Jones' England have a 6-0 win rate over the Wallabies.</p><p>Cheika is 10 wins from 22 Tests and nearly lost his job last year. As Jones pointed out on Thursday, in one concession to mind games, no team has lost a pool game and gone on to win the World Cup.</p><p>In this context, the wily hooker from Matraville in Sydney's south-eastern suburbs could have gone for the jugular two days out from their clash at Oita Stadium.</p><p>Instead he spoke fondly of mutual friend Jeff Sayle, who was farewelled in Sydney last week, and said he was proud of the career Cheika had built.</p><p>\"I just think we've always been mates, we just don't see each other very often. I live in Bagshot, so it's pretty hard to get from Bagshot to Coogee for a coffee,\" Jones said.</p><p>\"So we don't see each other but I'm proud of him. I reckon he's done a great job for Australian rugby. He has his heart on his sleeve, he gives it everything he's got; you can't ask for more than that.\"</p><p>Asked if Sayle's death had given him a chance to reflect on the importance of old ties, he welled up. \"Maybe, yeah.\"</p><p>Earlier, after being interrogated on his decision to drop incumbent No.10 George Ford for an Owen Farrell/Henry Slade playmaking combination, he was asked to assess Australia's World Cup campaign.</p><p>A potentially damaging but close loss to Wales and three less-than-convincing wins over Fiji, Uruguay and Georgia? Nothing but praise from Jones.</p><p>\"We know about Australia, they are a great tournament side. I think 'Cheik' has done a really good job,\" he said.</p><p>\"He's a good old mate of mine and there will be a bloke in the sky [Sayle] who will be quite excited about Michael and I coaching against each other this week. I'm sure he's having a few beers next to St Peter now looking at the situation.\"</p><p>Cheika returned the compliment, with a sting in the tail.</p><p>\"He's been there for a bit now hasn't he? He's done a good job for sure,\" he said. \"It always hurts me when there's an Aussie over there, you know what I mean? [England's Australian cricket coach] Trevor Bayliss and Eddie and, I don't know, [Great Britain rugby league coach] Wayne Bennett. You want them at home but it is what it is. What do you do?\"</p><p>There was another chance for mind games later, when Australia's lack of tactical guile was brought up. No kicking game to speak of and selection switch-ups every week? Straight bat from Jones.</p><p>\"I think each team works out how they want to play and you work that out with the resources you have,\" Jones said.</p><p>\"He's made the decision for his team and he thinks that's right, and they're a well-coached team, just look at his record.</p><p>\"As I said, I'm very proud of what he's done: he's got a team to a World Cup final, he's got them in the quarter-finals, before that Australian rugby was in disarray so he's done a great job for them.\"</p><p>Something's up. Jones, who ruthlessly and effectively targeted Welsh inexperienced five-eighth Rhys Patchell before their Six Nations clash in 2018, could manage only a statement of the obvious about Jordan Petaia's inexperience.</p><p>The master coach has either mellowed, or he's worried. England's final pool hit-out against France was cancelled as Typhoon Hagibis threatened last week.</p><p>The game would have offered England their toughest physical challenge and, potentially, an opportunity to test out this week's playmaking combination against another final-eight team.</p><p>Are England's enforcers battle-hardened enough for a showdown with a fired-up and under-fire Australia?</p><p>\"The rugby in a World Cup is pretty simple,\" he said. \"You don't see brilliant rugby in World Cups. You see teams that are able to do things over and over again well - deal with the intensity, application, work hard for each other - [win] World Cups.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520194742</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-TF91-JBJ7-N4W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Sometimes it is to their detriment.</p><p>According to numbers from ESPN and the Rugby World Cup website, put together and shared this week by rugby stats man Russ Petty, the Wallabies have averaged 14 kicks a game this year and 13 a match at the World Cup.</p><p>In this World Cup cycle, Australia have kicked less than any other team.</p><p>Teams ranked higher than Australia, such as New Zealand (21 kicks a game at the World Cup), England (29), Ireland (26), South Africa (26) and Wales (23) have a far more tactical kicking game.</p><p>Aside from the All Blacks, the others are renowned for implementing a lower-risk, territory-based style - to a certain extent - in which they want to operate at the other end of the field.</p><p>The number of Australian kicks a game has been reasonably consistent each year since the last World Cup. Therefore, this means the Wallabies have had more possession than most sides.</p><p>They have made more runs (157) a game than any other side at the World Cup for an average of 3.5 metres per carry and the fewest tackles a match (87).</p><p>Of the eight remaining teams in the quarter-finals, Australia (3.5 metres) sit seventh when it comes to metres gained per run. They are ahead of Ireland (2.8 metres), but lagging behind New Zealand (4.5) and England (4.3). Keep in mind the Wallabies, particularly in their past two matches against Uruguay and Georgia, have been picking and driving more often than normal, which brings that number down.</p><p>Tier 1 Average Match Stats 2016-19 <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>pic.twitter.com/NyvLPkwDLH</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>???

The exception is a team such as Ireland, who have excellent ball security but traditionally a less expansive attacking game than a side like the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia have turned the ball over more times than any tier-one team in 2019, doing so 19 times a game. That is an increase on 2016 (16), as well as 2017 and 2018 (both 15).</p><p>At the World Cup, the men in gold are coughing up the ball 17 times on average a game, on the higher end of the spectrum for top teams.</p><p>Statistics show limiting turnovers is of paramount importance for the Wallabies.</p><p>When Australia have a low error count they have shown - as they did in Perth during a record-breaking 47-26 victory over the All Blacks in August - they will inevitably beat more defenders and score more tries. That night there were 14 turnovers; their equal lowest this year.</p><p>In total this year, the Wallabies have turned the ball over 168 times, while their opponents have done so on 116 occasions.</p><p>With ball in hand, the Wallabies are evasive. In 2019, Australia are ranked second behind New Zealand when it comes to the number of defenders beaten in each match.</p><p>Discipline has been a problem for the Wallabies and, yet, while Australia have received three yellow cards at the World Cup - only Samoa have been given more - their overall penalty count is not disproportionate with other top ranking teams, despite being on the higher side.</p><p>Australia's nine penalties per game is on par with Wales and slightly more than England, Ireland and South Africa (all with an average of seven).</p><p>When comparing Australia to England throughout 2019, given the latter have had a relatively light run thus far at the World Cup after their France fixture was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Eddie Jones' side has scored more tries (4.7 to 3.9) and kicked in play more than double the amount the Wallabies have (30 times a game to 14).</p><p>Australia have offloaded more than England (10 times on average to nine) and made tackles at an equal success rate (85 per cent), but missed fewer (15 to 18) a game, which can be explained by their tactical plan to hold onto the ball.</p><p>Numbers won't mean much on Saturday when the two sides meet, but perhaps a surprise element might go a long way to getting the job done for two proud teams with plenty to prove.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520194135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-W841-DY19-C0HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><timeReceived>08:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

No decision has been made on games scheduled for Sunday, including Japan v Scotland in Yokohama.</p><p>\"Every effort is being made to ensure Sunday's matches will be played as scheduled,\" World Rugby said in a statement. \"A thorough assessment of venues will take place after the typhoon has passed before a final decision is made on Sunday morning.\"</p><p>The cancellations - unprecedented in the World Cup's 32-year history - will not affect the rankings in Pool C and means Australia are almost certain to play England in the first quarter-final match at Oita Stadium on October 19.</p><p>Italy, however, remained a mathematical chance of making the knockouts. A nil-nil draw, distributing two points to each team, will end their campaign.</p><p>\"The decision to cancel matches has not been taken lightly and has been made in the best interests of public, team, tournament personnel and volunteer safety, based on expert advice and detailed weather information,\" World Rugby said in a statement.</p><p>\"While we have extensively explored all options, public and team safety was our utmost priority as well as ensuring a consistent, fair and equitable outcome for all teams. All fans with tickets for a cancelled match will receive a full refund for the face value of their match tickets.\"</p><p>The Rugby World Cup organising committee held a media briefing in Tokyo at 2pm AEDT on Thursday.</p><p>Gilpin said the committee looked at making exceptions to tournament rules, which stipulate matches should be cancelled and not rescheduled in events such as these.</p><p>But it quickly became apparent the logistical exercise of moving the volume of people involved was not practical, he said.</p><p>France are likely to be furious as it robs them of the chance to top Pool C and play the runner-up of Pool D (likely to be Australia), which would have set up a potentially easier path through the final four.</p><p>England sit atop Pool C on 15 points with France on 13 points. Argentina's win over USA on Wednesday afternoon was not enough to help them qualify for the knockout stages. The 2015 semi-finalists will exit the tournament in coming days.</p><p>In Pool D, Australia and Wales are guaranteed quarter-final spots. The only way the Wallabies could top the pool is if they beat Georgia on Friday and the Welsh lose to bottom-placed Uruguay on Sunday.</p><p>If Australia beat Georgia and the Wales v Uruguay game in Kumamoto is also called off, it will make no difference to the final pool standings. The Wallabies and Wales would then be level on points but Wales will still be on top, having beaten Australia in the pool stages.</p><p>Hagibis is expected to deliver lashing rain and damaging winds of up to 270km/h, hitting Japan's southern island of Honshu over the weekend.</p><p>The Brave Blossoms are closing in on a historic quarter-final berth, topping their pool on 14 points with Ireland on 11 and Scotland on 10. Assuming Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday, the winner of Sunday's game in Yokohama will determine which teams go through to the knock-out rounds.</p><p>It was initially thought World Rugby was planning to move the Scotland v Japan game down to Oita Stadium, which has a roof.</p><p>But on Thursday morning, sources were indicating that organisers were hoping to proceed with the marquee fixture - the final game of the pool stages - in the same stadium in which the England v France game was to have taken place 24 hours earlier.</p><p>Tournament rules state that any pool game that cannot be played will not be rescheduled and instead be recorded as a 0-0 draw, with bonus points unavailable.

Top notch coaches and support staff, the country's best ever playing squad, and a historic win over France in the lead up.</p><p>John McKee has been told he will coach the team in their November clash against the Barbarians at Twickenham, but could be out the door after that. This was his second World Cup with the team.</p><p>And who will be coaching the Barbarians? None other than Fast Eddie. Watch this space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aussie referees snubbed</emphasis></p><p>Neither Angus Gardner nor Nic Berry were chosen to run the whistle for the final four games of the Rugby World Cup.</p><p>Gardner will be an assistant referee in Ireland's quarter final against New Zealand, while Berry will assist Jaco Peyper in Wales v France.</p><p>It is a fall from favour for Gardner, who refereed Wales v Ireland in the Six Nations this year and England v Ireland in 2018.</p><p>He hasn't had a great World Cup, or an easy one. He came in for criticism from Joe Schmidt after Ireland's loss to Japan and was switched out of England v Argentina after that, running Japan v Samoa instead.</p><p>But it's not all bad news for Australia; Jerome Garces was given the nod for the Wallabies' quarter final against England in Oita. He was the referee in Perth when Australia stunned the world and the All Blacks in the first Bledisloe Cup Test in August.</p><p>Then again, both Garces' assistants are French (Romain Poite and Mathieu Raynal) and Ben Skeen is the Television Match Official. Could be a long night of rugby.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Haskell breaks down Eddie vs Cheika</emphasis></p><p>Former England international James Haskell, who has lined up against Australia twice since the last World Cup, has shared a few interesting stories on Michael Cheika from his dealings with him at Stade Francais in 2010 and what he would be thinking during a Test week against Eddie Jones.</p><p>\"He loves playing on the underdog thing, having something to moan about,\" Haskell wrote for the Daily Mail. \"He'll be desperate for someone to say something in the media this week that winds him up. All he'll do is repeat it to his players. He'll feel aggrieved; it's his team against the world. That's why all the players who work with him want to play for him. You have seen this week how players will stand up for him. It's a mob mentality, which I bought into and still do.</p><p>\"In many ways, Cheika is similar to Eddie Jones, but in other ways they are very different. One is emotional, the other is not. Eddie loves revving Cheika up and Cheika loves getting revved up. It's a perfect formula. They're both so passionate, and players are inspired by that. Eddie may not have the physical aggression, but he has the brain power and the personality. We live in a world of PR where people are scared of saying anything and the players love it when these two go at each other.\"</p><p>Haskell also had a subtle sledge for some of Australia's more senior players that may not go down well in Wallabies camp ahead of a must-win clash.</p><p>\"When [Michael] Hooper, Kurtley Beale and Tevita Kuridrani are firing, they can be awesome but they have a tendency to implode,\" Haskell wrote. \"They do have a knack of getting it together against England. So what has gone before will not matter. It's game on.</p><p>\"It will be close, but I'm backing England by seven points.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Television figures off the charts in Japan</emphasis></p><p>Rugby-mania has completely swept through Japan, as evidenced by the latest TV figures from the home nation's stirring 28-21 victory over Scotland on Sunday.</p><p>More than 70,000 fans descended in Yokohama to watch the Brave Blossoms' final pool match yet the number of people who watched the match across the country, just a day after Typhoon Hagibis wreaked havoc, is eye-watering.</p><p>Viewing figures peaked at 53.7 per cent of the entire Japanese population, with an average of 39.2 per cent. That means over 60 million people in Japan alone were glued to the television as Jamie Joseph's side became the country's first Rugby World up quarter-finalists.</p><p>The domestic television audience has more than doubled since the opening game against Russia and the Scotland was a big improve on the Ireland and Samoa wins.</p><p>The Cauliflower has its money on those numbers being even bigger for a quarter-final this Sunday against South Africa, particularly given it was Japan who sprung the upset of the 2015 World Cup by beating the Springboks in Brighton.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520193560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-RDD1-JBJ7-N2NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><timeReceived>06:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

No decision has been made on games scheduled for Sunday, including Japan v Scotland in Yokohama.</p><p>\"Every effort is being made to ensure Sunday's matches will be played as scheduled,\" World Rugby said in a statement. \"A thorough assessment of venues will take place after the typhoon has passed before a final decision is made on Sunday morning.\"</p><p>The cancellations - unprecedented in the World Cup's 32-year history - will not affect the rankings in Pool C and means Australia are almost certain to play England in the first quarter-final match at Oita Stadium on October 19.</p><p>Italy, however, remained a mathematical chance of making the knockouts. A nil-nil draw, distributing two points to each team, will end their campaign.</p><p>\"The decision to cancel matches has not been taken lightly and has been made in the best interests of public, team, tournament personnel and volunteer safety, based on expert advice and detailed weather information,\" World Rugby said in a statement.</p><p>\"While we have extensively explored all options, public and team safety was our utmost priority as well as ensuring a consistent, fair and equitable outcome for all teams. All fans with tickets for a cancelled match will receive a full refund for the face value of their match tickets.\"</p><p>The Rugby World Cup organising committee held a media briefing in Tokyo at 2pm AEDT on Thursday.</p><p>Gilpin said the committee looked at making exceptions to tournament rules, which stipulate matches should be cancelled and not rescheduled in events such as these.</p><p>But it quickly became apparent the logistical exercise of moving the volume of people involved was not practical, he said.</p><p>France are likely to be furious as it robs them of the chance to top Pool C and play the runner-up of Pool D (likely to be Australia), which would have set up a potentially easier path through the final four.</p><p>England sit atop Pool C on 15 points with France on 13 points. Argentina's win over USA on Wednesday afternoon was not enough to help them qualify for the knockout stages. The 2015 semi-finalists will exit the tournament in coming days.</p><p>In Pool D, Australia and Wales are guaranteed quarter-final spots. The only way the Wallabies could top the pool is if they beat Georgia on Friday and the Welsh lose to bottom-placed Uruguay on Sunday.</p><p>If Australia beat Georgia and the Wales v Uruguay game in Kumamoto is also called off, it will make no difference to the final pool standings. The Wallabies and Wales would then be level on points but Wales will still be on top, having beaten Australia in the pool stages.</p><p>Hagibis is expected to deliver lashing rain and damaging winds of up to 270km/h, hitting Japan's southern island of Honshu over the weekend.</p><p>The Brave Blossoms are closing in on a historic quarter-final berth, topping their pool on 14 points with Ireland on 11 and Scotland on 10. Assuming Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday, the winner of Sunday's game in Yokohama will determine which teams go through to the knock-out rounds.</p><p>It was initially thought World Rugby was planning to move the Scotland v Japan game down to Oita Stadium, which has a roof.</p><p>But on Thursday morning, sources were indicating that organisers were hoping to proceed with the marquee fixture - the final game of the pool stages - in the same stadium in which the England v France game was to have taken place 24 hours earlier.</p><p>Tournament rules state that any pool game that cannot be played will not be rescheduled and instead be recorded as a 0-0 draw, with bonus points unavailable. That would ensure Japan go through and that Scotland fail to reach the quarter-finals for just the second time in the tournament's history.</p><p>\"While making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday's matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon,\" Gilpin said.</p><p>\"As a result, we have taken the decision to cancel some matches in order to ensure the safety of all involved. It is the right thing to do, and comes with the support of all stakeholders, including the teams.</p><p>\"We fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first. They will be entitled to a full refund on their match tickets.</p><p>\"Our message for all fans in Japan for Rugby World Cup is to heed all official advice, stay indoors throughout Saturday and do not attempt to travel on the day.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520191497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7J-J8T1-JBJ7-N1KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><timeReceived>04:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Sometimes it is to their detriment.</p><p>According to numbers from ESPN and the Rugby World Cup website, put together and shared this week by rugby stats man Russ Petty, the Wallabies have averaged 14 kicks a game this year and 13 a match at the World Cup.</p><p>In this World Cup cycle, Australia have kicked less than any other team.</p><p>Teams ranked higher than Australia, such as New Zealand (21 kicks a game at the World Cup), England (29), Ireland (26), South Africa (26) and Wales (23) have a far more tactical kicking game.</p><p>Aside from the All Blacks, the others are renowned for implementing a lower-risk, territory-based style - to a certain extent - in which they want to operate at the other end of the field.</p><p>The number of Australian kicks a game has been reasonably consistent each year since the last World Cup. Therefore, this means the Wallabies have had more possession than most sides.</p><p>They have made more runs (157) a game than any other side at the World Cup for an average of 3.5 metres per carry and the fewest tackles a match (87).</p><p>Of the eight remaining teams in the quarter-finals, Australia (3.5 metres) sit seventh when it comes to metres gained per run. They are ahead of Ireland (2.8 metres), but lagging behind New Zealand (4.5) and England (4.3). Keep in mind the Wallabies, particularly in their past two matches against Uruguay and Georgia, have been picking and driving more often than normal, which brings that number down.</p><p>Tier 1 Average Match Stats 2016-19 <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>pic.twitter.com/NyvLPkwDLH</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>???

The exception is a team such as Ireland, who have excellent ball security but traditionally a less expansive attacking game than a side like the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia have turned the ball over more times than any tier-one team in 2019, doing so 19 times a game. That is an increase on 2016 (16), as well as 2017 and 2018 (both 15).</p><p>At the World Cup, the men in gold are coughing up the ball 17 times on average a game, on the higher end of the spectrum for top teams.</p><p>Statistics show limiting turnovers is of paramount importance for the Wallabies.</p><p>When Australia have a low error count they have shown - as they did in Perth during a record-breaking 47-26 victory over the All Blacks in August - they will inevitably beat more defenders and score more tries. That night there were 14 turnovers; their equal lowest this year.</p><p>In total this year, the Wallabies have turned the ball over 168 times, while their opponents have done so on 116 occasions.</p><p>With ball in hand, the Wallabies are evasive. In 2019, Australia are ranked second behind New Zealand when it comes to the number of defenders beaten in each match.</p><p>Discipline has been a problem for the Wallabies and, yet, while Australia have received three yellow cards at the World Cup - only Samoa have been given more - their overall penalty count is not disproportionate with other top ranking teams, despite being on the higher side.</p><p>Australia's nine penalties per game is on par with Wales and slightly more than England, Ireland and South Africa (all with an average of seven).</p><p>When comparing Australia to England throughout 2019, given the latter have had a relatively light run thus far at the World Cup after their France fixture was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Eddie Jones' side has scored more tries (4.7 to 3.9) and kicked in play more than double the amount the Wallabies have (30 times a game to 14).</p><p>Australia have offloaded more than England (10 times on average to nine) and made tackles at an equal success rate (85 per cent), but missed fewer (15 to 18) a game, which can be explained by their tactical plan to hold onto the ball.</p><p>Numbers won't mean much on Saturday when the two sides meet, but perhaps a surprise element might go a long way to getting the job done for two proud teams with plenty to prove.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520194135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-W841-DY19-C0H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><timeReceived>08:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Still, small wonder the Japanese don't get too stressed over natural disasters. As Chris Webb, a former Wallabies assistant manager who these days spends quite a lot of time in Japan, remarked, \"the locals aren't fussed by this at all. They'll ride it out, clean up afterwards and be in at work by midday\".</p><p>Okay, Typhoon Hagibis is regarded, even by meteorologists, as something of a monster, so perhaps this could take them a little longer but certainly the feeling here is that while everyone around them is running around and losing their heads - and by that I mean basically all foreigners - the Japanese don't panic. Indeed, the first people to realise something catastrophic was about to happen to their country during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami were the passengers on the 33 bullet trains - the Shinkansen - whose emergency brakes were activated remotely, prompted by the seismometer which detected the earth quake 12-15 seconds before it hit. That's making technology work for you in a natural disaster.</p><p>The Japanese experience, on average, 19 typhoons per season - which runs from July through to October - so they have this situation well in hand, on a par with fire services in Australia. And as someone who recently had cause to sing the praises of my local fire services as bushfires bore down on my suburb, you quickly come to realise that they are acting to keep you alive.</p><p>So it all seemed a little churlish when the London Sun blasted World Rugby for having the audacity to bring a World Cup into Japan during a period when typhoons might occur. A bit like bemoaning the Ashes series being held in Australia in 2021-22 during the height of the fire season.</p><p>Still, until the cancellations, nothing like this had ever happened in the 32-year history of the World Cup. The only thing that was even close was when the 1995 semi-final between France and hosts South Africa was delayed by an hour while \"ground staff\" - which looked awfully like a lot of women sweeping the water off the field while a lot of important-looking men stood around directing them - got the ground ready. Had the match been called off, France would have won. Needless to say, the game went ahead and the Springboks won an epic cliffhanger. Funny that.</p><p>That's another reason, incidentally, to tip your hat to the Japanese. If their match on Sunday against Scotland is abandoned, they go through to the quarters for the first time and the Scots go home, no doubt grumbling. So far it hasn't been cancelled. Of course, if the weather turns particularly nasty, it still might be called off but the organisers are letting Mother Nature have her say.</p><p>It's the fans who were hit the hardest by the decision to cancel the England-France and NZ-Italy games, those who might have paid a fortune for a once-in-a-lifetime experience and were drastically short-changed.</p><p>Like them, I am confused that the matches could not have been transferred indoors. Australia played two of their pool matches under closed roofs, at Sapporo and Oita, and given the importance of the matches cancelled, I can't understand why the teams weren't relocated en masse to a ground where they could get the game played.</p><p>It would be a great shame, not to mention a financial disaster, if they had to be played in front of empty houses but at least the result would have been valid.</p><p>This way, Italy can gripe that they were dudded out of a quarter-final spot. But it might have made their captain Sergio Parisse's gripes just a little more believable had Italy just once, in the 14 times they have played New Zealand, come within a converted try of their opponent.</p><p>The question now is whether England and New Zealand will benefit from having a two-week break between matches. No doubt Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen, the All Blacks coach, will complain about how the momentum of their sides was broken, how they had intended to use the cancelled matches to give further game time to players returning from injury, like Brodie Retallick.</p><p>All very true. Don't believe a word of it.</p><p>If there is one common refrain from all coaches at World Cups - I'm sure I can even recall Jones coming out with it when he was Wallabies coach for the 2003 tournament - they all say how difficult it is to win the thing because their footballers have to play seven Tests one after another.</p><p>Well, now they don't. But that only applies to the two sides that arguably need least help of all, England and the All Blacks.</p><p>It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good and almost before World Rugby had cancelled their match against France - almost as if they might have had some foreknowledge of it and, indeed, might have participated in the decision-making process - England were on their way south to Miyazaki, on the island of Kyushu, where it just so happens they will play Australia next Saturday at Oita.

Dry, combative, pugnacious. The Eddie rugby fans are used to, the one to which they became accustomed when the Randwick hooker took over the Wallabies coaching job in 2001.</p><p>The Jones who has targeted weakness in others with a samurai's precision, exploited advantage where he could find it and taunted his opponents.</p><p>Rhys Patchell, a ginger-haired Welsh five-eighth, didn't see him coming. On the eve of England's blockbuster Six Nations clash with Wales last year, in which Patchell was wearing the No.10 jersey in just his fourth Test start, Jones unsheathed his blade and struck.</p><p>\"He's a young guy, he's inexperienced and is their third-choice 10. He will have to find guys around him to help because he'll be under some heat,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'd imagine that when (Welsh captain) Alun Wyn Jones and the guys go down for breakfast on Saturday morning, they'll be looking at him thinking: can this kid handle the pressure today?</p><p>\"It's a big ask ... one hell of an experience for the kid. I hope he has the bottle on Saturday.\"</p><p>Patchell crumbled, England won 12-6.</p><p>Two years earlier, in June 2016, he'd turned the blowtorch on his homeland, and two Randwick stablemates, to devastating effect. In Australia for the first time as England coach, fresh off a Six Nations championship win, Jones's squad dismantled Australia - and Australian confidence - over three Tests.</p><p>He'd taken every advantage possible, using a juvenile line of questioning from former Wallabies back rower and Randwick club mate Stephen Hoiles as a chance to distance himself from Australia and prove to England where his loyalties lay.</p><p>\"You've seen the promotions Fox Sports have been running this week and the kind of questions we get - it is quite demeaning, disrespectful to the team, so we're not going to let this opportunity pass,\" Jones said.</p><p>In the lead-up to the series he'd threatened \"Bodyline rugby\" and marshalled his players to deliver it. The scorelines were 39-28, 23-7 and 44-40 in the dead rubber. The Michael Cheika Wallabies, less than a year clear of an inspiring, if ultimately unsuccessful World Cup campaign, were bleeding out.</p><p>And so it went. Jones took England on an unmatched winning streak, came within a Test loss of losing the job after the six-game losing streak that followed, and rose from the ashes in a way no Test coach of a tier one nation has done before. In the 17 Tests since England's 2018 form dip, they have lost just three.</p><p>He arrived in Japan on a mission. Still feted in public in the nation he took to the 2015 World Cup and a watershed win over South Africa, he adorned advertisements and tourism campaigns.</p><p>The ruthless streak still pulses. The eyes, trained to assess and destroy, still gleam.</p><p>But on at least three occasions during this World Cup, 20 teams whittled down to eight, with three weekends of knockout rugby to go, Jones has let the mask slip.</p><p>He fought back tears in Sapporo when a journalist asked him what it meant to be coaching England at a World Cup in his mother's homeland. He was emotional in his first public comments on the death of close mate and Randwick rugby legend Jeff Sayle.</p><p>And this week, in the function room in Beppu, with upwards of 30 recording devices blinking at him in anticipation of the verbal barrage surely - surely! - on its way ahead of England's quarter-final showdown with Australia, Jones was reflective.</p><p>\"I just think we've always been mates, we just don't see each other very often,\" he said of Cheika. \"I live in Bagshot, so it's pretty hard to get from Bagshot to Coogee for a coffee. So we don't see each other but I'm proud of him. I reckon he's done a great job for Australian rugby. He has his heart on his sleeve, he gives it everything he's got; you can't ask for more than that.\"</p><p>Sayle's death was the obvious trigger for the newfound restraint. Jones contemplated flying home for his funeral on the eve of England's toughest pool game against France. He ruled it out, before the typhoon changed everyone's plans.</p><p>But it wasn't just Sayle. As Jones sat before the cameras and lights there was a poignant sense of a career - a life - that had come full circle.</p><p>He is the son of an Australian soldier and a Japanese interpreter. He was born in Burnie, Tasmania, but raised in Sydney. He married a Japanese woman, Hiroko, after the pair met while teaching at Sydney's International Grammar School. They raised their daughter, Chelsea, who now works at Rugby Australia, bilingual.</p><p>Jones's time coaching Japan created the precursor to the 2019 side that swept aside Ireland and Scotland to secure a historic quarter-final berth this weekend. It was a spell that resurrected his career after a bitter departure from Australia in 2005 and the clincher for the England job.</p><p>Now he's sitting in Japan, a country to which he remains deeply connected, coaching England against the country he loves which, at one stage, didn't love him back. And there's a dearly departed mate to whom he could not say goodbye.</p><p>\"There will be a bloke in the sky (Sayle) who will be quite excited about Michael and I coaching against each other this week,\" Jones told the function room.</p><p>The samurai's still in there, preparing his troops for battle against the Wallabies. But these past weeks in Japan the world has seen Eddie Jones the human, too. The proud son, the Australian with a Japanese heart, and the loyal friend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77l2ky0x3leuqsgg5rv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X99-FXY1-F0J6-J55F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 19, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CFE3</classCode><className>SPORTS FANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CNR5</classCode><className>HOTEL MEETING FACILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But we can at least celebrate what an incredible tournament it has been and the extraordinary role the Japanese locals have played in making it so. I can't remember being so swept up in a televised sporting event than I did the pool match between the host nation and Scotland, not just because of the drama surrounding whether or not it would be played. Indeed, fronting up to fill the stadium, just hours after Typhoon Hagibis had devastated their shores showed the pure pride and determination of the locals to put on a show. Sitting on my couch felt like I was there, with the noise of the crowd carrying through on the coverage, which could not resist turning the cameras on the stands full of smiling faces. So patriotism aside, Japan wins my prize for host with the most. And a special commendation to Kieran Gilbert, the Sky News political specialist who has brought such gravitas to Fox Sports' coverage and anchored the panel analysis with aplomb. - Holly Byrnes</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CATCH-UP!</p><p>CAN it be more than a year since Anthony Bourdain paid his bill and left us forever?

Instead, look forward to the pleasure of making a Friday date with the dashing Theo James, leading man to Charlotte (played by Rose Williams), who moves to a seaside resort called Sanditon and navigates \"class divides, romantic tensions and personal ambitions.\" James would give Colin Firth a run for his money in any wet shirt competition, making quite the handsome period drama poster boy. And if you're wondering where you've seen him before on the small screen - most recently, he appeared in the Netflix fantasy series The Dark Crystal but his most-talked-about role was as the illfated Turk, who came to a rather awkward end in season one of Downton Abbey.

Scrum practice after dinner. The most brutal fitness training players had ever endured.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The story of Japan's meteoric rise from token World Cup hosts to being on the cusp of qualifying for a maiden quarter-final did not happen overnight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meticulous planning and deliberate collaboration between the national side and Japan's Super Rugby team, the Sunwolves, were just a few pieces in the puzzle.</p><p>On July 28, 2009, the International Rugby Board Council, as it was known back then, awarded Japan hosting rights for 2019 - a bold decision to award Asia its first Rugby World Cup.</p><p>\"It is an exciting combination ... and one which we think will enable the sport to reach developing rugby markets and therefore contribute to the continued growth of the game,\" IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset told reporters at the Burlington Hotel in Dublin at the time.</p><p>Japan has a rich rugby history, with the first recorded team - the Yokohama Football Club - coming into existence in 1866 and almost 300,000 players participating in the sport in 2018 according to World Rugby figures.</p><p>With the World Cup set in stone, the Japan Rugby Football Union bent over backwards to make sure players were as ready as could be and the Sunwolves' introduction to Super Rugby in 2016 was of major benefit to the national setup.</p><p>Australian-born second-rower James Moore, who three years ago was playing for Brisbane City in the National Rugby Championship, has witnessed first-hand what has gone into a campaign which has seen the Brave Blossoms go through their first three matches undefeated.</p><p>\"I don't think anyone else has had the same preparation,\" says Moore, who has started in all three Tests for Japan this World Cup.</p><p>\"Most people can't fathom how hard we worked.\"</p><p>A quarter-final berth has always been the team's goal and even if that does not come to fruition - if Scotland beat Japan on Sunday with a bonus point the Brave Blossoms won't qualify - a famous 19-12 win over Ireland will be forever remembered by both sides as an upset for the ages.</p><p>Japan coach Jamie Joseph, with a wry smile, offered this after the Ireland match: \"We have been preparing for this game a hell of a lot longer than the Irish have ... the last year at least, if not the last three years,\" he said.</p><p>\"The Irish have been thinking about this game since Monday.\"</p><p>The advantage was that while other countries around the world had their players slugging it out in provincial competitions, such as Super Rugby, Japan was pulling its best players out of Sunwolves and domestic Top League duties to get them into a full-time program.</p><p>No other top nation had the luxury Japan had in organising a seven-week intensive camp at the beginning of the year. There was even a specific tour to New Zealand and Australia where Japan's top players were able to compete in matches against Super Rugby 'B' sides - as well as train for hours on end as a cohesive unit.</p><p>\"It was a shock to the system,\" Moore says. \"We were doing six training sessions a day. In that was three conditioning sessions, plus mauls and scrums after dinner.</p><p>\"Everyone said it was the hardest training they had done. It was so tough. \"We had the opportunity to do whatever training we wanted. Ireland and Scotland are big maul teams, so we did an incredible amount of maul defence. It's not the most fun part of the game but you've got to do it.</p><p>\"Everyone counted us out in that Ireland game but we went in planning to win it. The coaches gave us the game plan to win and we all believed we could do it. We went out and did it.</p><p>\"It felt special because we had been together for so long. Everyone is really close. It was a really unique preparation.\"</p><p>Having the same coaches for the past few years has also benefited Japan immensely. Head coach Jamie Joseph looked after both the Sunwolves and Japan before fellow Kiwi Tony Brown stepped into the Super Rugby role this year. Brown is also an assistant of Japan - as is defence coach Scott Hansen, who has worked with both teams.</p><p>Joseph spotted Moore in his second season with Toshiba in the Top League. He was quick to set up a meeting with the Australian, now 26, who grew up playing rugby league and attended Brisbane State High School with Samu Kerevi and another Australian in the Japan squad: Will Tupou.</p><p>\"He is a tough guy ... and he can get a bit scary sometimes,\" said Moore of Joseph. \"But he cares about the players and individually helps us develop. He offered me a contract for the Sunwolves and I'd always wanted to play Super [Rugby]. It worked out pretty well.\"</p><p>Japan's footballers have been treated like rock stars at this World Cup, with a staggering 46.1 per cent of those watching television last Saturday tuning into the final stages of the Brave Blossoms' 38-19 win over Samoa.</p><p>Moore has likened the celebrity status to \"being held hostage\", with over 1000 thousand fans waiting outside their team hotel before games to catch a glimpse or video of their heroes. \"It's been pretty incredible,\" Moore says. \"I didn't know what to expect when I came over and I've loved it. They're really passionate fans and really get behind it. Rugby is really going to take off after the World Cup.</p><p>\"It is sad the Sunwolves won't be in Super Rugby [from 2021]. A lot of people love the Sunwolves and we were starting to get a lot better. The domestic league is getting stronger so I don't think it's going to be too bad.\"</p><p>If Typhoon Hagibis does strike and the Japan-Scotland fixture is cancelled, the home side will qualify for the quarter-finals.</p><p>It is a result that will bring unbridled joy throughout a country already immensely proud of its rugby team that continues to exceed the expectations of those oblivious to what has gone into making this a successful campaign.</p><p>\"It'd be massive for the country,\" says Moore. \"It doesn't matter if they call us the underdogs. The guys in this squad are world-class and they are ready for it. We enjoy the pressure and we're ready to go.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77hh4hcjpibiu5kxicg</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7T-NKD1-F0J6-J0VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0005PXF</classCode><className>BURLINGTON HOTEL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7011 HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D9GY</classCode><className>SPORTS INSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A3NR</classCode><className>SOCCER TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DE1R</classCode><className>PHYSICAL FITNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000671</classCode><className>EXERCISE &amp; FITNESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As the constitutional monarch, he formally appoints the prime minister and chief justice of the Supreme Court, and performs other ceremonial functions but, unlike Queen Elizabeth, he is not the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</p><p>\"He can express himself only through carefully weighted utterances and symbolic gestures,\" says Dr Lionel Babicz, lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Sydney.</p><p>\"When I think about the important responsibility I have assumed, I am filled with a sense of solemnity,\" Naruhito said in May.</p><p>As the first modern Japanese emperor to have been born in peacetime, the mild-mannered Naruhito is more distanced from the war shadows hanging over his father. He is also the first emperor to have a university degree, to speak several languages, to have posed for selfies with members of the public and to have spent time living abroad, which included a visit to Melbourne in 1974.</p><p>A musician (viola) and historian, he spent two years in Oxford researching medieval forms of transport for the River Thames (and wrote a memoir about it called The Thames and I). He also, famously, learned how to wash his own laundry.</p><p>What kind of emperor will he be?</p><p>\"It is widely expected that Emperor Naruhito will follow in his father's footsteps,\" says Dr Babicz, \"being the symbol of the state and remaining close to the people - but, of course, he will also adapt to the new issues of the 21st century. We may see the emperor symbolising a new ecological agenda, for instance.\"</p><p>Naruhito is regarded as an expert on water issues. In a 2013 speech to the United Nations on the lessons that can be learned from water disasters, he mixed the pragmatic and the poetic, citing a popular essay written in 1212 by a Shinto priest who had recorded details of disasters he witnessed.</p><p>\"A Japanese modern epigram says that a disaster strikes when people lose their memory of the previous one,\" said Naruhito. \"The message [the writer] sent across the centuries strikes us when we are facing a similar situation after disasters.\"</p><p>He also explained a theme of the priest's work rather poignantly. \"Let me at this point explain to you a key word of Japanese philosophy - 'hakanasa', usually translated as 'evanescence' or 'fleetingness'. A good example of this is the blossoming of the cherry blossom in spring - a symbol which you all might recognise of Japan. The blossoms are beautiful but they fall and are dispersed in the wind only after a few days. For Japanese, there is a certain sadness in this and cherry blossoms are fleeting just as life is.\"</p><p>Like his father, Naruhito married a commoner, Owada Masako, in 1993. Educated in economics and law at Harvard, Oxford and in Tokyo, she was one of only three women out of 800 applicants to pass an entrance exam to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987, leading to a high-flying diplomatic career, which she reluctantly dropped to become a princess.</p><p>Reportedly facing intense pressure to produce a male heir, she suffered stress-induced \"adjustment disorder\". At one point, Naruhito broke with protocol to defend her, saying she had \"totally exhausted herself\" trying to adjust and there had been moves to \"negate her career and her personality\".</p><p>Perhaps it is a matter of social mores catching up with Masako. When she spoke in fluent English with Melania Trump during a visit by the Trumps to Tokyo in May, there was an outpouring of admiration on social media, The New York Times reported. \"She is awesome and cool,\" tweeted a fan.</p><p>\"Though the previous emperor and empress were seen as being close to the people, these two seem even closer,\" Hideya Kawanishi, an assistant history professor at Nagoya University, told Reuters. \"I think it's because they appear to be more like ordinary people.\"</p><p>The couple's only child, 17-year-old Princess Aiko, will now have a higher profile but is not in line to the throne. The absence of a male heir in the imperial family for many years caused hand-wringing, including moves to change the law to make it possible for firstborn females to inherit the throne.</p><p>But when Naruhito's younger brother, Prince Akishino, had a son in 2006, Hisahito, the reforms were promptly shelved.</p><p>with AAP, AP, Reuters,</p><p>Bloomberg and NHK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc77mm21xgduh5tj85dqv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9Y-CDC1-F0J6-J018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1182\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLCL</classCode><className>MONARCHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>PE000DO1B</classCode><className>NARUHITO, EMPEROR OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DADF</classCode><className>SHINZO ABE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

For Japanese, there is a certain sadness in this and cherry blossoms are fleeting just as life is.\"</p><p>Like his father, Naruhito married a commoner, Owada Masako, in 1993. Educated in economics and law at Harvard, Oxford and in Tokyo, she was one of only three women out of 800 applicants to pass an entrance exam to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987, leading to a high-flying diplomatic career, which she reluctantly dropped to become a princess.</p><p>Reportedly facing intense pressure to produce a male heir, she suffered stress-induced \"adjustment disorder\". At one point, Naruhito broke with protocol to defend her, saying she had \"totally exhausted herself\" trying to adjust and there had been moves to \"negate her career and her personality\".</p><p>Perhaps it is a matter of social mores catching up with Masako. When she spoke in fluent English with Melania Trump during a visit by the Trumps to Tokyo in May, there was an outpouring of admiration on social media, The New York Times reported. \"She is awesome and cool,\" tweeted a fan.</p><p>\"Though the previous emperor and empress were seen as being close to the people, these two seem even closer,\" Hideya Kawanishi, an assistant history professor at Nagoya University, told Reuters. \"I think it's because they appear to be more like ordinary people.\"</p><p>The couple's only child, 17-year-old Princess Aiko, will now have a higher profile but is not in line to the throne. The absence of a male heir in the imperial family for many years caused hand-wringing, including moves to change the law to make it possible for firstborn females to inherit the throne.</p><p>But when Naruhito's younger brother, Prince Akishino, had a son in 2006, Hisahito, the reforms were promptly shelved.</p><p>with AAP, AP, Reuters,</p><p>Bloomberg and NHK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77mndfy6x91jcolsi5f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9Y-CDC1-F0J6-J06T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1182\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLCL</classCode><className>MONARCHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>PE000DO1B</classCode><className>NARUHITO, EMPEROR OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DADF</classCode><className>SHINZO ABE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Dry, combative, pugnacious. The Eddie rugby fans are used to, the one to whom they became accustomed when the Randwick hooker took over the Wallabies coaching job in 2001.</p><p>The Jones who has targeted weakness in others with a samurai's precision, exploited advantage where he could find it and taunted his opponents.</p><p>Rhys Patchell, a ginger-haired Welsh five-eighth, didn't see him coming. On the eve of England's blockbuster Six Nations clash with Wales last year, in which Patchell was wearing the No.10 jersey in just his fourth Test start, Jones unsheathed his blade and struck.</p><p>\"He's a young guy, he's inexperienced and is their third-choice 10. He will have to find guys around him to help because he'll be under some heat,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'd imagine that when [Welsh captain] Alun Wyn Jones and the guys go down for breakfast on Saturday morning, they'll be looking at him thinking: can this kid handle the pressure today?</p><p>\"He's got to get the ball wide, and that's going to be a big job. It will be different to playing against Scotland. It's a big ask ??? one hell of an experience for the kid. I hope he has the bottle on Saturday.\"</p><p>Patchell crumbled, England won 12-6.</p><p>Two years earlier, June 2016, he'd turned the blowtorch on his homeland, and two Randwick stable mates, to devastating effect. In Australia for the first time as England coach, fresh off a Six Nations championship win, Jones' squad dismantled Australia - and Australian confidence - over three Tests.</p><p>He'd taken every advantage possible, using a juvenile line of questioning from former Wallabies back-rower and Randwick clubmate Stephen Hoiles as an opportunity to distance himself from Australia and prove to England where his loyalties lay.</p><p>\"You've seen the promotions Fox Sports have been running this week and the kind of questions we get - it is quite demeaning, disrespectful to the team, so we're not going to let this opportunity pass,\" Jones said.</p><p>In the lead-up to the series, he'd threatened \"Bodyline rugby\" and marshalled his players to deliver it. The scorelines were 39-28, 23-7 and 44-40 in the dead rubber. The Michael Cheika Wallabies, less than a year clear of an inspiring, if ultimately unsuccessful, World Cup campaign, were bleeding out.</p><p>And so it went. Jones took England on an unmatched winning streak, came within a Test loss of losing the job after the six-game losing streak that followed, and rose from the ashes in a way no Test coach of a tier one nation has done before. In the 17 Tests since England's 2018 form dip, they have lost just three.</p><p>He arrived in Japan on a mission, a gnarled patina to the weathered Australian skin now and the faintest signs of a stoop. Still feted in public in the nation he took to the 2015 World Cup and a watershed win over South Africa in the group stages, he adorned alcohol advertisements in Sapporo and tourism campaigns.</p><p>The ruthless streak still pulses. The eyes, trained to assess and destroy, still gleam.</p><p>But on at least three occasions during this World Cup, 20 teams whittled down to eight, with three weekends of knockout rugby to go, Jones has let the mask slip.</p><p>He fought back tears in Sapporo when a journalist asked him what it meant to be coaching England at a World Cup in his mother's homeland. He was emotional in his first public comments on the death of close mate and Randwick rugby legend Jeff Sayle.</p><p>And this week, in the function room in Beppu, with upwards of 30 recording devices blinking at him in anticipation of the verbal barrage surely - surely! - on its way ahead of England's quarter-final showdown with Australia, Jones was reflective.</p><p>\"I just think we've always been mates, we just don't see each other very often,\" he said of Cheika. \"I live in Bagshot, so it's pretty hard to get from Bagshot to Coogee for a coffee.</p><p>\"So we don't see each other, but I'm proud of him. I reckon he's done a great job for Australian rugby. He has his heart on his sleeve, he gives it everything he's got; you can't ask for more than that.\"</p><p>Sayle's death was the obvious trigger for the newfound restraint. Jones contemplated flying home for his funeral on the eve of England's toughest pool game against France. He ruled it out, before the typhoon changed everyone's plans in Japan last weekend.</p><p>But it wasn't just Sayle. As Jones sat in that function room in Beppu, surrounded by the cameras and lights that trail the person with the biggest coaching job in international rugby, there was a poignant sense of a career - a life - that had come full circle.</p><p>He is the son of an Australian soldier and a Japanese interpreter. He was born in Burnie, Tasmania, but raised in Sydney's south-eastern suburbs in 1960s Australia. He married a Japanese woman, Hiroko, after the pair met while teaching at Sydney's International Grammar School. They raised their daughter, Chelsea, who now works at Rugby Australia, bilingual.</p><p>Jones' time coaching Japan created the precursor to the 2019 side that swept aside Ireland and Scotland to secure a historic quarter-final berth this weekend. It was a spell that resurrected his career after a bitter departure from Australia in 2005 and the clincher for the England job.</p><p>Now he's sitting in Japan, a country to which he remains deeply connected on countless levels, coaching England against the country he loves which, at one stage, didn't love him back. And there's a dearly departed mate to whom he could not say goodbye.</p><p>\"There will be a bloke in the sky who will be quite excited about Michael and I coaching against each other this week,\" Jones told the function room, his worlds colliding.</p><p>\"I'm sure he's having a few beers next to St Peter now looking at the situation.\"</p><p>The samurai's still in there, preparing his troops for battle against the Wallabies. But these past weeks in Japan, the world has seen Eddie Jones the human, too. The proud son, the Australian with a Japanese heart, and the loyal friend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520195061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9B-FHH1-JBJ7-N1DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><timeReceived>00:50 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The following might have been titled '10 Things I Hate About Union', but the 2019 tournament has defied my prejudices and I have been enjoying it - in a mixed, head-scratching, frustrating kind of way. It hit me that the World Cup is, for better and worse, a metaphor for our times. Here are 10 ways the RWC reflects a world in dis/union:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It really is too long</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But isn't that the truth about all entertainment? Once a formula has been found, it gets milked to saturation point. Married At First Sight, The Block, that singing show with the prawn head: if it works, it's got to be worked to death. There might be economies of scale in banging us over the head with bloat, but there are limits. A writer friend of mine was recently asked to blurb a new book. He said (not for the blurb) that it was good, but 200 pages too long. Which brought to mind something the great author David Malouf once said about every book he read: what they all had in common was that they should be shorter.</p><p>People are getting bigger</p><p>Answer me this. You go to a school rugby match and there are a dozen kids 190cm tall and weighing 100kg. They're 18 years old and the size of the 1980s Wallabies. And then their parents wander up and they are five-foot-six and 10 stone. How did young people get to be so enormous? Transfer this to the World Cup and I reckon at post-match functions there is a land of the giants (players) mingling with the pygmies (their parents). The rugby world is hurtling towards one-tonne forward packs. No wonder the scrums, like cars, have to be de-powered. They and the children driving them are just getting too big.</p><p>Migration enriches all</p><p>A question doing the rounds at the Rugby World Cup has been, what if all those Pacific Island-heritage players for Australia, New Zealand and England could play for their 'home' countries? Then we might see a completely different World Cup. But what this overlooks is that these footballers are now playing for their home countries. To align nation with race, to differentiate between 'true' Australians or Englishmen and 'imports' is to take the world back to dark and dangerous times and, speaking of stupid, ideologies that are proven failures. Look at the top performers in this World Cup, all rainbow nations. It's no accident why multicultural outfits perform better.</p><p>People are faster and stronger, just not smarter</p><p>One of the interesting observations about Jordan Petaia's exciting debut for the Wallabies against Uruguay was Paul Cully noting that the 19-year-old \"put his older teammates to shame with his rugby IQ\". You would have to agree that this Rugby World Cup has shown unprecedented levels of athleticism, power, speed and dumb-arse plays. Did anyone see Ireland play Japan? If they hadn't already invented Irish jokes, they would have to now. But it's not just the Irish. Every game provides a highlight reel of dumb kicks, dumb passes, dumb phases, dumb rolling mauls, dumb decisions. Today's international rugby players are so well prepared physically, they could run through brick walls. Unfortunately, most of them would do so without remembering there's a ball under their arm. A handful of key players with superior rugby IQ are going to decide this World Cup. They are, alas, a mere handful.</p><p>Divisions between rich and poor are widening</p><p>A rising tide lifts all boats, but human history shows that it lifts some boats faster than others. The spread of professionalism is improving the rugby capabilities of the second- and third-tier nations, but it is improving those of the top-tier at a faster rate. Every World Cup, we hear the same baloney about the gap narrowing. It's not. Japan beating Ireland is the only rankings-upset so far. Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are further behind than they ever have been. Italy? Until 2013, Italy were beating top-tier nations once or twice a year. Since 2013, Italy have recorded just two wins over the top tier. Standards for the poor countries are improving, but each year the rich are advancing further ahead of them.</p><p>Lawyers paralyse progress</p><p>The policing of 'dangerous' play, where 'danger' is defined not by commonsense or observation but by a set of body parts (shoulder connects with head, elbow connects with neck), is well-intentioned, but misguided. Referees' hands are tied, except to dole out yellow cards with a shrug and \"I have no choice, this is the framework\". What they are obeying is a legal framework born from the concept of duty of care and the fear of future litigation. The legal tail is wagging the rugby dog and having the same impact as legal tails everywhere.</p><p>We are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good</p><p>Forget the NRL grand final. If you want to see a refereeing fiasco, tune in to any RWC match. Sometimes you might think you are watching televised bureaucracy, with officials convening committees to micro-manage every occurrence in slow-motion replay and reduce a game to a series of decision-making 'protocols'. We are fast approaching two-hour games, where video and on-field officials put themselves on centre stage in their Quixotic pursuit of perfection, as if that was what we had come to see. Rugby is stuck in technology's thrall. There is no perfect game where referees get everything right and have limitless time to make sure they do so. That idea of perfection, which exists only in the imaginations of law-enforcement officials, is what is known elsewhere as a failed totalitarian state.</p><p>Australians aren't as good as we think we are</p><p>It's a long time since the irony Donald Horne intended in his 'Lucky Country' was lost. With our exceptional history in the Rugby World Cup, Australians have grown to expect the Wallabies to overachieve. Maybe it's our isolation. We think we're a little bit special, a bit lucky. We murmur that we're in this with a big chance. Don't think so.</p><p>Religion is the opium of the people</p><p>Japan is great - packed stadia, happy crowds of locals and tourists, everyone enjoying the global festival of rugby. People are on such a high at being part of the event that they don't even notice when 40 per cent of their 'entertainment' comprises attempts to pack and re-pack scrums. When Australia played Wales, with seven minutes to go the game hung in the balance. The next three-and-a-half minutes were lost while a single scrum was (not) being packed. Did anyone notice? No, they were having too good a time. Rugby is their religion.

I regard the coaching of NSW as one of the blue ribbon appointments of world rugby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fact that the NSW brand has been damaged owes itself almost exclusively to shocking coaching appointments and, from that, poor recruitment and equally poor selection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So an unsuccessful New Zealander leaves the NSW job before his time is up. How much was he paid out?</p><p>And an unknown and unsuccessful New Zealander replaces him, appointed by his New Zealand \"mate\", the then CEO of NSW Rugby, Andrew Hore, who takes off before the ink is dry on Penney's contract and the chairman of the NSW board knows nothing about it!</p><p>When Hore took the CEO job at the Waratahs, he spruiked that he knew the secrets of the Crusaders' success and he would turn the Waratahs into a winning organisation.</p><p>That was rubbish.</p><p>The franchise has gone backwards, quickly, since Michael Cheika departed. In 2017, Hore made a goose of himself by revealing he had been taking lessons in losing from a corporate coach.</p><p>One newspaper captured the moment: \"Hore is learning how to lose.\" Apparently the rugby family were paying for Hore to be \"coached\" by an outfit called The Coaching Room. That was reported in April 2018.</p><p>But Hore had been working with them since April 2017 and as the newspaper story reported it: \"The club had its worst season in a decade in 2017.\" Well may we say the coaching in how to lose was profoundly successful. The chairman of NSW Rugby, Roger Davis, is a man of quality and accomplishment, a former Rhodes Scholar, a former Wallaby and a successful businessman.</p><p>Roger Davis's language in hearing about this farce highlighted his displeasure. He should now revoke the contract of Penney, appoint an Australian and, at the very least, make sure an Australian and, preferably, a New South Welshman, becomes the new CEO.</p><p>As with the coaching ranks, there are plenty of excellent Australian candidates, not that you would have to be too flash to do better than Hore.</p><p>All that matters is the scoreboard.</p><p>Hore has been everywhere - Canterbury, Wales, back to New Zealand, back to Wales, then NSW and now back to New Zealand.</p><p>His wanderings didn't seem to sharpen his capacity. The formerly great NSW finished 10th, 16th and 12th under his watch.</p><p>And if, as it is being argued, there were 61 applicants for the coaching job, who were they?</p><p>If there was a shortlist of 12, who were they?</p><p>If there were only two interviewed, who was the other?</p><p>Who did the interviewing?</p><p>As I have asked many times, are we running a secret society here? Why can't the public know?</p><p>What I do know is that the great David Campese, whom I have referred to as the Bradman of rugby, didn't make the shortlist. In fact no one spoke to him. He received a note advising him that there were other, more outstanding candidates!</p><p>The criticism that can be levelled at Roger Davis is two-fold. Was he happy with this abortive process for appointing a coach, two people interviewed?</p><p>Was he aware of those who didn't make it to first base?</p><p>Was the administrative performance of Hore such that he was seemingly given control of the process?</p><p>Was it just a coincidence that his \"mate\" came up trumps?</p><p>The second criticism derives from the fact that Hore got the job in the first place.</p><p>If he was worthy of the prestige associated with the NSW job, why would previous employers have let him go?</p><p>Hopefully the lessons are learnt.</p><p>As I have been arguing for months, a complete administrative cleanout is required of Rugby in this country. Hore is gone. Should Cameron Clyne and Raelene Castle be far behind? The rugby family have had a gutful.</p><p>Which brings us, before we come to the World Cup, to the Israel Folau issue. The news that young Jordan Petaia's mother has become mixed up in the Israel Folau case is disturbing. Petaia is an outstanding talent, well worthy of an international jersey.</p><p>He does not need this sort of publicity, nor does the team.</p><p>Earlier reports suggest that there are players in the Wallaby camp not happy about this issue.</p><p>They are supportive of Israel and therefore, probably, not happy with Jordan's family.</p><p>Michael Cheika could do without these media shenanigans.</p><p>The whole affair could have been managed differently if Raelene Castle or Andrew Hore had taken some time to sit down with Israel and, with compassion and reason, reach some compromise about the social media post.</p><p>Instead, their rank incompetence has created a massive issue over what should have been a straightforward man-management exercise.</p><p>Has Hore jumped before he was to go down in a sinking ship?</p><p>Could it be that Hore realised he would not survive if NSW and Rugby Australia lose the court case. Try telling the rugby family this is not an embarrassment and a mess.</p><p>Meanwhile, with typhoon Hagibis expected to hit Japan shortly, some quarter-final spots will owe more to what has happened off the field than on it.</p><p>France won't be happy that the match against England has been cancelled. Nor will Australia, who would have been hoping for an improbable French victory to avoid England in a quarter-final.</p><p>But this is as nothing to the prospect of Japan v Scotland being called off. The host nation will cheer. Japan would go into the quarters to avenge the disappointment of 2015 when the same Scotland beat them into the quarter-finals by virtue of a bonus point.</p><p>With a changed side yet again, we face Georgia in the Shizuoka Stadium, which is an open air ground south of Tokyo.</p><p>Whether my observations last week have counted or not I have no idea. But Toomua at number 10, Hooper on the bench and Pocock as captain are positive steps.</p><p>The Georgians were well beaten by Fiji in wet conditions.</p><p>They struggled to shut down Fiji's outside backs, and, I must say, Fiji were outstanding and unlucky against Wales on Wednesday.</p><p>We should crush the Georgians but, again, we will have to be patient and disciplined. The Georgians are as tough as an old boot. They will be led by Mamuka Gorgodze, the mighty backrower, who plays for Toulon in the French Top 14, nicknamed \"Gordzilla\" by his teammates. This is his fourth World Cup.</p><p>He is 35 and well past his best, but he has been a dominant force in French club rugby for the past decade.</p><p>Interestingly, Georgia have barely 3000 players; Australia claims to have registered 230,000.</p><p>Georgia are coached by another no-name Kiwi, assisted by two very accomplished former English players, Joe Worsley and Graham Rowntree.</p><p>Worsley was part of Martin Johnson's 2003 World Cup winning team. Graham Rowntree has previously been England's forwards coach. He is a scrum specialist and Worsley is a talented defence coach.</p><p>The Georgians will compete up front, but should be carved up by the talented Wallaby backs, if they are given their heads.</p><p>Australia need a good hitout to prepare properly for the intensity of a quarter-final against England.</p><p>Eddie Jones may be more concerned about the cancellation of the match against France than he is prepared to let on.</p><p>He could have rotated his team, leading to a French victory in which case he would have avoided New Zealand in the semi-final, if England navigate their way past us.</p><p>As I have said previously, England are massive. Their backs are massive. And England were impressive dispatching Argentina who, it must be said, had little chance once they lost their enforcer Tomas Lavanini to a red card.</p><p>He was sent off for a high shot on the England captain, Owen Farrell. To gain a form comparison, England flogged Argentina 39-10; France only squeaked home thanks to a missed penalty shot from Argentina at the end of the game.</p><p>To this point, it has been a splendid competition, superbly run by the Japanese with magnificent stadia in a country whose courtesy and cleanliness are something to behold.</p><p>And while NSW waged a puerile pre-election attack on Gladys Berejiklian's promise to give Sydney a world class stadium at Moore Park, Japan have a dozen.</p><p>And the Olympic Games are around the corner.</p><p>We should parcel up a few of our blazer brigade and shuffle them off to Japan to learn how effectively things can be done.</p><p>The quarter-final contests which lie ahead could provide some of the finest international rugby in a long time. I still favour South Africa to get the job done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-b8650af2eb0e11e9a044e49bf0c4e438368ca6192b63a48c30f554285b8cf99d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7R-F791-JD3N-53MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1401\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000668</classCode><className>EXECUTIVE MOVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009S4D</classCode><className>BUSINESS COACHING &amp; MENTORING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And, if there is, they rarely venture past Anzac Parade, which is a fallacy because I saw at least a dozen of them at the grand final against the Raiders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the constant stream of abuse into this column's inbox this week is any indication, there's a lot more than that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anyone who's dared to be critical of referee Ben Cummins changing his mind over a tackle restart in the final eight minutes of the decider has copped it in the neck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Somehow, furious Roosters supporters have interpreted the debate about Cummins' call as an attack on their premiership, their players, their coach, their unborn children.</p><p>The excrement hasn't just hit the fan but my poor old inbox. One bloke took me apart over a column that I didn't write because it appeared in a rival publication. Another suggested I must have put money on the Raiders (I'm a bad punter, but not that bad).</p><p>Then came this appalling accusation: \"You are clearly a Souffs supporter\". Low blow.</p><p>Nobody, as far as I can see, is begrudging the Roosters winning back-to-back premierships - including Souffs supporters.</p><p>Can we not discuss a very significant moment that changed the course of the game - while also celebrating the Roosters' being the first side of the NRL era to defend their title?</p><p>Can we not argue that Cummins changing his mind was wrong - while also saying it was unfair for Roosters halfback Cooper Cronk to be sin-binned?</p><p>Can we not question the broader problem of officiating in the NRL this season - while also lauding another incredible season from the Roosters in which they tackled everything but the corner post?</p><p>Or are we, as fans of this great game of rugby league, now incapable of grasping such complex matters? Are we that binary? Does it have to be one or the other?</p><p>So, for the sake of balance and fairness and any perceived, let us lavish praise on the Roosters one last time.</p><p>Let's start at the top with chairman Nick Politis and his board. Few have shown as much passion for their club as Uncle Nick since he first became involved as a sponsor in the 1970s.</p><p>His post-match interview on Channel Nine with Brad Fittler was significant.</p><p>\"Is this the best Roosters team you've seen?\" asked Fittler, who captained the 2002 premiership team.</p><p>\"It is,\" Politis said. That's saying something.</p><p>Opposition fans assume the team is millions over the salary cap, but it's the club Politis has created, through years of hard work and his own hard earned, that has made it so attractive to players.</p><p>In the grand final, they had superstars across the park.</p><p>Prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is almost 31 but playing better than ever. He made two hit-ups in the opening set of the match and made 130 metres before half-time. He deserved the Clive Churchill Medal as much as Raiders five-eighth Jack Wighton.</p><p>The other standout forward was Sio Siua Taukeiaho off the bench. He ran for 184 metres in 47 minutes, and made a line break late in the match when the Chooks needed some inspiration.</p><p>Fullback James Tedesco could barely breathe throughout the match with so many Raiders defenders on him. But there he was, in the right spot, at the right time, hunting up the play, to score the match-winner.</p><p>But let's roll the tape back a few seconds???</p><p>From being dumped from the Blues side after game one, to getting pushed and pulled by those in his inner circle about a possible move to Souths, to calling out appalling online racist abuse, he's Latrell Mitchell has had a funky year.</p><p>He, too, was kept quiet by the Raiders' defence. Then he missed a penalty goal at 8-all that would've kicked his side clear.</p><p>But there he was, flick passing like he's Matt Gidley to release winger Daniel Tupou, who then passed inside for Tedesco.</p><p>Mitchell's vision is being lauded, and rightly so, but it was five-eighth Luke Keary who set up that try, having the vision to scoot down the blindside.</p><p>The Roosters simply aren't the team they are without Keary, but he's become the player he has because of Cronk.</p><p>Should Cronk become an Immortal? Robinson joked afterwards that he had a better left-to-right pass. But we all know his brilliance extends beyond that; it's his influence on the side, away from the field as much as on it, that makes him special.</p><p>Does that make him Immortal worthy? Cronk's record alone - two titles at the Storm, two at the Roosters - means he's in the discussion.</p><p>But, for mine, the two best players for the Roosters were their wingers.</p><p>The club was thinking about offloading Tupou a few seasons ago. Now, he's often as damaging as Blake Ferguson bringing the ball out to start their sets. On the left, Brett Morris snuffed out bomb after bomb into his corner, leaping above the pack and coming down with the pill.</p><p>Yet the person who deserves the most credit is Robinson.</p><p>The Roosters were angry with a column in this space last week about him being disliked by rival coaches but adored by his own players. There was no malice intended, just an insight into how he's perceived by some of his peers.</p><p>Regardless of perception, there is no doubting Robinson's greatness. Three premierships in seven seasons is one thing. But it's the attitude of all his teams that makes them great.</p><p>Robinson is drawing comparisons to former Easts coach Jack Gibson, who won premierships in 1974-75 before winning another three with the Eels from 1981-83.</p><p>The cornerstone of Gibson's philosophy was that everything started with defence. His favourite player wasn't Arthur Beetson, it was Barry \"Bunny\" Reilly, who was the size of a halfback but axed ball-carriers whenever they came near him.</p><p>Gibson was an innovator, ahead of his time. Robinson is a football intellect.</p><p>Where Robinson loses many people, though, is when he tries to snooker people with that intellect, as he did on Nine's post-match panel when Johnathan Thurston asked about the \"six-to-go\" controversy. Robinson's response did him no favours.</p><p>\"Look I don't know do you feel as though we got lucky there JT?\" Robinson said, before adding: \"Mate my thoughts? Honestly if you are bringing that up at this time there could have been lots of decisions that we want to go through.\"</p><p>According to his Nine colleagues, Thurston was \"gutted\" about the incident. He asked a relevant question and did so respectfully.</p><p>Anyhow, that's it. Another Big Dance, over for another year.</p><p>Bravo to you, you magnificent Chooks. A raised decaf soy vanilla mocha with two artificial sweeteners to you.</p><p>Farewell to a Red V legend</p><p>Few had a heavier heart on grand final morning than St George winger Johnny King when the news broke that his former teammate, Eddie Lumsden, had passed away at the age of 84.</p><p>King had seen it coming, having visited him at North Shore Private Hospital on Friday morning. Lumsden had been struggling after suffering a heart attack three months ago.</p><p>\"He said, ???Hello, Johnny', but then slipped back into unconsciousness,\" King said. \"We were like brothers. We played together, we were always roommates, we later owned pubs together.\"</p><p>Lumsden will go down as one of the Red V's greatest players, having played in nine of the club's famous 11 straight premierships from 1956-66.</p><p>\"People forget how big he was,\" King said. \"After Norm Provan, he was the biggest player in our side.\"</p><p>Lumsden's funeral will be held at The Therry Centre, East Maitland, on Friday at 2pm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The quote</emphasis></p><p>\"Sydney's racing boss has urged the VRC to consider moving the date of the Melbourne Cup.

Despite their doll-like demeanour, they are powerful comments on the interaction between humans and the the natural and spiritual world, concepts that are closely entwined in Japan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When I draw, I always feel as though I am a little girl myself. Just as when I was little, I still cannot draw a boy or a man. I was quite a cheerful child but my personality gradually changed and I became afraid of talking to people. This is because I believed I was different from other people,\" the artist says, through an interpreter, often pausing before she answers a question for a lengthy and thoughtful \"hmmm\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I wanted to be alone in the mountains or in a quiet place. This darker side appeared in my artwork.\"</p><p>We are days from the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, and a three-hour bullet train ride away from Tokyo, as Chiho, who is rarely interviewed, describes how much of her work, most notably the 2015 show Rebirth of the World shown in Seattle and Tokyo, has been an artistic expression of Japan's vulnerability to weather events.</p><p>\"I became very scared. Living in Japan, we face natural disasters which we cannot stop because the country sits on many active faults that frequently cause major earthquakes. We have to live with them. I created a character called Maguma-chan, who is a natural spirit, thinking about the natural disasters, particularly the tsunami, from the nature's point of view. The character is simply there, but she inevitably causes earthquakes from time to time, and it can't be helped.\"</p><p>One of the stars of the Art Gallery of New South Wales' upcoming Japan Supernatural exhibition, Chiho arrives for our interview in a Kyoto hotel bearing gifts of beautifully wrapped sweets. She casts a tall chic figure with her two-tone designer sandals, ostrich-feather trimmed black top and on-trend jeans. It is obvious, before she admits it, that some of her \"little girls\" are avatars.</p><p>During the show, another character Moimoi will flutter from promotional flagpoles around the city. Chiho's self-perceived \"strangeness\", which once made her feel an outsider, has created a palpable connection around the world, particularly with women and on Instagram. \"I started creating Moimoi when I was walking in a graveyard every day. Moimoi is an avatar of myself who is playing around in nature.\"</p><p>As a child, Chiho believed she was \"different and strange\". While she made conventional drawings in the sight of her teachers and family; privately she filled secret notebooks with intimate, unusual and even erotic imaginings that she would toss away on completion. \"At the end of elementary school my parents found out and I was very embarrassed. They didn't mind, but I thought I was different from other children. I wanted to be the same as other people. I wanted to be ordinary.\"</p><p>Ashamed of the discovery, she stopped drawing through high school and then chose the most ordinary of university courses, economics. \"It didn't make any sense but, looking back, I always tried to be normal. But university was so boring and I realised it would be impossible for me to work in a bank or for a company.\"</p><p>A part-time role as an assistant in an advertising agency opened her eyes. \"I was very surprised that young people my age were doing designing and were responsible for their work. They were very different from the people I used to meet. It made me feel that I am not so strange; there are people who are stranger than me. I became confident that I could express myself.\"</p><p>The funky young colleagues taught Chiho how to draw on an Apple Macintosh computer and she began to create her own work after hours. When renowned artist Takashi Murakami (see page 8) came to the agency to work on an advertisement for the US release of the movie Ghosts in the Shell, she showed him some printouts of her work, not realising how famous he was.</p><p>\"He thought my work was interesting and encouraged me. It was the first time my drawing was approved.\" One year later, in 1999, Murakami invited her to take part in a group show of new artists, Tokyo Girls Bravo, which was then shown in New York in 2004, and she subsequently joined his extensive production design team at the Kaikai Kiki studio, in a converted suburban factory, until \"it became too difficult to work as a designer and an artist so I quit the company\".</p><p>She continues to be categorised as part of Murakami's Superflat movement, a post-modern art movement influenced by traditional non-three-dimensional forms of Japanese art as well as the contemporary images of manga and anime.</p><p>Although rarely mentioned but not a secret, Aoshima and Murakami are now married and have two children, son Shin no Suke, 9, and daughter Natsuko, 6, who are coming with them to the Sydney opening, eager to see koalas and fruit bats. The reason for their privacy and the rejection of the status of celebrity art couple is clearly well considered and, arguably, it is a strategy that has allowed Aoshima's work to gain recognition in its own right.</p><p>Having met Murakami two days earlier, it would be fair to describe the couple as chalk and cheese; he a workaholic extrovert known for sleeping in a large cardboard box at his studio, she a thoughtful introvert who revels in solitude and has deliberately lived near two graveyards in Tokyo.</p><p>\"I wasn't uncomfortable living there.I felt as though in the graveyard nature flourished, cuddling against the sadness of us humnas unable to defy our death. \" she said. \"I found something I really wanted there. It felt very calming and comfortable.\"</p><p>In a video produced by Dark Motion Graphics for her exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum in 2015, Aoshima says: \"I imagine when you die, the pain and dying would disappear as if you are in a dream. I want to keep reminding myself that inside my body is a skeleton and we all eventually die. Or that I could die tomorrow. I really don't want to forget this feeling.\"</p><p>Initially, Aoshima created her work in Adobe Illustrator, her pieces printed out as ink-jet or chromogenic prints or as wallpapers that have covered walls and ceilings of exhibition space. By 2006, she was incorporating, after much practice, freehand drawing. During a residency in San Antonio, Texas, she digitally printed a 12-metre-long wall work on traditional Japanese paper, collaged the sheets on a wall and then added detail in watercolour and coloured pencil.</p><p>Moimoi subsequently appeared in hundreds of drawings on Japanese rice paper, in dream-like landscapes, alongside cities consumed by waves and flames. The catalogue for the Seattle exhibition commented: \"The drawings, like her murals before, depict utopian visions of a world where mountains and buildings come to life and exist harmoniously with fairy-like creatures.\"</p><p>Talking about her work to me, Aoshima says: \"I am not good at describing my work. I believe people can understand me through my artwork. Most of my works express the spirit in nature. Even the buildings have a spirit. The buildings represent human beings. I like to describe the relationship between humans and nature. I imagine that we can connect with nature. Usually I get inspiration from nature. When I think about nature, it has a soul or a spirit so it connects to the Yokai tradition too.\"</p><p>Aoshima has said that in exploring natural disasters, such as earthquakes and typhoons, she initially sought to show the smallness of human existence and how \"in the great power of nature that we have no chance against nature\". But her perspective changed when she was \"greatly moved by the robust power of recovery\" in the four years after the great earthquake and tsunami disasters of 2011. \"Everyone was shocked and beaten but both people and nature steadily recovered.\" Her work pivoted to explore the regeneration that can follow destruction.</p><p>Xiojin Wu, curator of Japanese and Korean art at the Seattle Art Museum, says: \"When I first saw Chiho's work, I was so drawn into the fantastic world she created and so impressed by her incredible imagination. But it's not just the imagination - she really thinks that world exists.\"</p><p>Melanie Eastburn, senior curator of Asian art at the AGNSW says: \"Chiho Aoshima's work has an intimacy about it that I find compelling and endearing. The characters, some of which are objects that are usually inanimate such as buildings, have distinct personalities. I believe audiences will be spellbound by the spirit-filled fairytale world she has created.\"</p><p>Murakami has written that Aoshima's work \"fits into a feminine, spiritual world that is an area of calm air amidst the context-ridden testosterone-filled worldview of contemporary art\". When a tsunami hit Indonesia shortly after an exhibition of her 2004 work, Magma Spirit Explodes: Tsunami is Dreadful, some pointed to her \"witch-like\" prescience.</p><p>In her video works, Aoshima has collaborated with New Zealand animator Bruce Ferguson, notably on City Glow (2005), which has been shown at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, and Rebirth of the World (2015). In the fashion world, she worked with Murakami on the iconic multi-colour pastel logo pattern for Louis Vuitton and her piece The Red-eyed Tribe (2000) initially an invitation to an Issey Miyake fashion show, was later blown up to 4.5 metres by 16 metres for Superflat at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2001.</p><p>In Sydney's Japan Supernatural exhibition, 24 of Aoshima's watercolours, some with pencil additions, will feature in a dense grouping accompanied by an interactive digital work, Little Miss Gravestone's Absent Musing, a triptych that mirrors a traditional block print format. This work has previously been seen in the Rebirth Of the World at the Seattle Art Museum and Murakami's Kaikai Kiki gallery in Tokyo. Works by one of her inspirations, the acclaimed 19th century artist Katsushika Hokusai, are shown in the same room. French symbolist painter Odilon Redon (1849-1916) is another artistic influence.</p><p>Her latest artistic adventures are in pottery - although, like many parents, she now finds she does not have enough time for her art. Experimenting in a new medium is very enjoyable \"but it has not changed what I want to express that is, the theme of people and nature.\"</p><p>Chiho Aoshima is part of the Sydney International Art Series exhibition Japan Supernatural at the Art Gallery of NSW from November 2-March 8.

But Japan argues that whale meat is part of its culture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Its whalers plan to kill 950 whales, using a loophole in a global moratorium that allows \"lethal research\" on the marine mammals. Up to 50 humpbacks will be targeted in the first large-scale hunt of the once nearly extinct species since a 1963 moratorium put whales under international protection.</p><p>The Sea Shepherd environmental group says its ships will ram the Japanese vessels when they begin whaling operations. Greenpeace announced it will use less violent measures to interfere with the fleet.</p><p>Harvesting Fish Oil</p><p>British researchers say they have genetically modified plants to produce omega-3 fatty acids normally found in oily fish.</p><p>The development may provide an alternative to the world's dwindling fish stock in providing health benefits to the human diet.</p><p>Scientists at Rothamsted Research isolated key genes from a species of microscopic single-celled marine algae, inserted the genes into crops such as linseed and oilseed rape and found that the plants were able to synthesize omega-3 fatty acids in their seed oils.</p><p>Fish do not produce the fatty acids themselves, but build them up in their bodies by consuming large quantities of such algae.</p><p>The scientists say they plan to expand on that concept by feeding the GM-enhanced oils to chicken and other livestock to produce omega-3-enriched meat, milk and eggs.</p><p>Child of Krakatau</p><p>Intense activity continued at Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano with the mountain spewing flaming rocks hundreds of metres from its crater.</p><p>Scientists said the volcano posed no imminent threat of an explosive eruption, but fishermen and visitors were advised to stay outside a 3km danger zone.</p><p>Anak Krakatau, which means \"Child of Krakatau,\" formed in the Sunda Strait after the legendary explosion of Mount Krakatau (Krakatoa) in 1883, which triggered tsunamis and killed more than 36,000 people.</p><p>Angolan Mystery Illness</p><p>International experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) say they are baffled by an unidentified disease that has killed five people in Angola and sent more than 200 others to hospital.</p><p>All of the victims complained of sleepiness, dizziness and difficulty in walking and speaking.</p><p>The WHO has ruled out the possibility that the illness is due to a virus since it appears not to be transmitted from one person to another. Investigators believe the outbreak, which began in early October in Cacuaco, north of the capital of Luanda, is due to some kind of toxic exposure.</p><p>Tropical Cyclones</p><p>The second-strongest cyclone to strike Bangladesh since records began left thousands dead after storm-surge tides up to 6m high rushed inland from the Bay of Bengal. Wildlife experts fear endangered tigers and other animals in the Sunderbans mangrove forest may have also perished in Cyclone Sidr.</p><p>o Flash floods from Cyclone Guba's outer bands left 160 people dead in eastern Papua New Guinea.</p><p>o Thousands of people in the eastern Philippines were evacuated as Typhoon Mitag approached only days after Typhoon Hagibis killed 10 people in the same area.</p><p>Earthquakes</p><p>About 30 students were injured fleeing their classrooms in southwestern Iran when a 5.1 magnitude quake jolted oil-rich Khuzestan province.</p><p>o A 6.7 magnitude quake shattered windows in southern Ecuador on November 15.</p><p>o Earth movements were also felt across Jordan and Israel, in southern Sumatra, Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and northern Chile.</p><p>'Hot Wire' Barrier</p><p>Wildlife authorities in northeastern India have begun using the world's hottest-tasting chili peppers to keep wild elephants from trampling human settlements and devouring crops.</p><p>Forest rangers in Assam state initially tried electric fences to provide protection, but had to try another \"hot wire\" method after those efforts failed to keep the marauding pachyderms at bay.</p><p>Rope barriers smeared with grease and Bhut Jolokia pepper oil, stretched around settlements bordering the forest, appear to be doing the trick.</p><p>\"The grease acts as a waterproof.
