Through hard work and collaboration, we, the youth, present this declaration to show our deep concern and our determination to drive change. Youth voices matter-they are the changemakers of today and tomorrow. We urge the world to recognize and empower us as we lead toward a better future.</p><p>We, the youth, envision a world where poverty and hunger are eliminated, supported by sustainable financing, inclusive governance, and equal opportunities in quality education. Education is the foundation of sustainable growth and must be accessible, equitable, and lifelong. We call for partnerships with restaurants, supermarkets, and governments to develop mobile food banks and organize community kitchens for those in need. Additionally, mental health education is essential to breaking the stigma and ensuring well-being for all. Our future depends on empowerment through education that builds skills, awareness, and resilience in our communities.</p><p>Our economies must evolve to balance sustainable growth with environmental respect. We stand for economic development driven by green skills, eco-friendly innovations, and investments in renewable energy and power storage systems. We urge governments and businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create affordable energy options that support smart cities with rainwater storage, electric transit, and energy-efficient housing. Responsible, sustainable consumption will allow us to protect resources for future generations.</p><p>A peaceful world relies on justice, strong institutions, and fair policies. We call for climate justice, equitable resource distribution, and inclusive decision-making that represents all communities. To tackle domestic violence, we advocate for stronger protections and accessible support services. Justice and peace must be priorities if we are to create safe, resilient societies where everyone can thrive. Transparent policies and collaborative actions across borders are essential to building accountability and fostering unity.</p><p>Our natural resources are our legacy, and we commit to protecting forests, oceans, and biodiversity. Sustainable forest action and marine conservation are essential to safeguarding biodiversity and promoting climate stability. We support forest restoration, ocean-based solutions, and policies that empower communities to act as guardians of their ecosystems. Through education and systemic change, we can inspire responsible stewardship of the environment, ensuring that our planet remains vibrant and resilient for generations to come.</p><p>Together, we are powerful. The Sustainable Development Goals are more than targets; they are a promise to create a world where all people live with peace, justice, and opportunity. We, the youth, pledge to this journey. We will work across borders, foster responsible consumption, and champion innovation. This is our commitment: to inspire others, to act with urgency, and to build a fair, healthy, and thriving future for everyone.</p><p>This declaration is both a call to action and a roadmap. Our commitment, grounded in the SDGs, is to lead with innovation, fairness, and urgency. Together, we will build resilient communities, protect our planet, and stand for justice and peace.

As large-scale renewable energy development expands, more land use conflicts are arising between renewable energy development, ecological conservation, and local communities.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Geographic Society, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National Cheng Kung University, \"Spatial planning methods are becoming more widely used to address such conflicts, however, they often lack local community input and values. In this study, we develop a Participatory Least Conflict Solar Energy Siting Framework based on energy justice theory which uses place-based stakeholder engagement paired with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic In-formation System (GIS) based multi-criteria decision making. We operationalize a case study in Southwestern Taiwan to identify and evaluate suitable solar development sites and demonstrate how the framework can be used. The results of our AHP surveys show a general consensus that protecting the natural environment is important as the top three prioritized factors: 'Avoid Environmental Protected Land', with a priority of 20.8%, 'Avoid Other Important Natural Areas', with a priority of 11.9%, and 'Avoid Other Natural Areas' with a priority of 8.2%. In addition, if only 12% of the land with medium to high suitability are developed for solar energy generation, Tainan City and Chiayi County alone could support the Taiwan government's solar devel-opment goal of 20 GW of installed solar capacity for the entire country by 2025. Our study also reveals that the use of participatory methods in site evaluation and final site design is important to ensure true suitability with local ecological, social, and economic systems.
