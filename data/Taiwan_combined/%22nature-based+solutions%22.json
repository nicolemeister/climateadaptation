According to news originating from Taipei, Taiwan, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Air pollution and heat increase the prevalence and risk of anxiety disorders, which are particularly severe under the increasing trends of climate change and urbanization. Well-designed green spaces have mediating effects on the threats posed by environmental deterioration and promote public health.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Taipei, \"However, previous research has overlooked these effects. This cross-sectional ecological study applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to data from Taiwanese cities and towns to infer the vital influences of and complex relationships among green spatial patterns (i.e., the dispersion, patch area, fragmentation, aggregation, and coverage ratio of green spaces), socioeconomic status (i.e., income and population aging), atmospheric environment (i.e., air pollution and high temperature), and anxiety disorders. The results reveal that minimizing the dispersion of green spaces and maximizing their patch area and coverage ratio are associated with reduced prevalence of anxiety disorders. Air pollution and high temperature mediate the influence of green spatial patterns on anxiety disorders. Population aging, air pollution, and high temperature are factors that increase the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders, whereas income level has a negative effect. This study identified the pathways and influences (i.e., indirect, direct, and total impacts) of green spatial pattern characteristics on anxiety disorders. These findings show that the adoption of effective greening policies may promote the development of healthy cities.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Moreover, this study provides a useful methodology for clarifying complex pathways and identifying vital factors that can be applied to future research in health science and policy.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Nature-based solutions to address anxiety disorders: A cross-sectional ecological study of green spatial patterns in Taiwan.

However, there has been less focus on the divergence in context-specific knowledge between local residents and outsider participants in NBS events, as well as the identified implications for rural governance. This paper aims to address these theoretical gaps by examining a case study of eco-craft trail maintenance through a participatory action process. Our study involved conducting participatory action research, including in-depth interviews with 17 participants, to explore the rural governance in Pinglin before and after eco-craft trail maintenance events. The research revealed that local residents in Pinglin demonstrate a significant level of commitment to environmental conservation and exhibit a strong sense of attachment to their local community. Within the framework of multi-stakeholder collaboration, our study found that local individuals, as opposed to outsider volunteers, display a reluctance to deviate from their established work habits. This phenomenon, referred to as tshi &amp; uacute;-l &amp; omacr;o in Taiwanese, embodies a collective body memory rooted in customary knowledge and physical skills unique to the local community. This paper suggests that the maintenance of eco-craft trails cannot solely rely on government resources. Instead, it necessitates comprehensive training and preparation to effectively integrate local residents with outsider volunteers in collaborative efforts.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Recommendations for enhancing multi-stakeholder collaboration are essential for advancing environmental conservation, rural governance, and facilitating sustainable transformation.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Participatory Actions for Investigating Eco-craft Trail Activities: a Case of Pinglin In Taiwan.

The vulnerability of developing regions was also highlighted. It is crucial for international stakeholders to prioritize and increase financial resources for climate-friendly projects in these regions. The participation of Cathay FHC is of significance because it helps unlock economic potential, bridge the funding gap, and drive global climate action especially between Asia and the world.</p><p>\"To mitigate and adapt to climate change and its threats, we need substantial financial resources and support from all stakeholders. We are delighted to partner with Cathay Financial Holdings, which brings governments, private sector entities and other stakeholders together to explore investment opportunities and mobilize funds for climate-related projects within Taiwan and beyond.

Additionally, as the largest commercial real estate owner, we collaborate with governments and tenants to provide green-leasing services, enabling SME tenants to procure renewable energy and work towards their climate goals.\" Lee stated.</p><p>Finally, Cathay FHC believes the potential of collaboration to make a meaningful impact. For years, Cathay FHC has been taking proactive engagement actions and actively participating in global initiatives. Lee added, \"one notable example is our engagement with leading Taiwanese companies as part of the Climate Action 100+ initiative. These companies collectively account for 20% of Taiwan's total carbon emissions. Through our engagement efforts, we encourage them to commit to net-zero targets and set mid-term goals.\"</p><p>Government policies, interim targets, and strategic plans will offer corporations greater opportunities to foster technological advancements and innovative business models. \"The transition to a low-carbon economy necessitates substantial capital, and it is imperative to recognize that we cannot drive this transformation single-handedly. Collaboration among stakeholders is essential to bring about the necessary changes in the economy and achieve our sustainability goals.\" Lee concluded.</p><p>In addition to CIS, Cathay FHC has scheduled to participate this year's World Biodiversity Summit alongside UNGE in New York, World Climate Summit alongside COP28 in Dubai, and has also scheduled its annual climate summit aimed at convening various sectors across Asia, taken place on 7/4 in Taipei.</p>", "publisher": "Taiwan News", "instances": ["The President of Cathay Financial Holdings () Chang-Ken Lee made history as the first representative from Taiwan to address at the prestigious Climate Investment Summit, taken place on 6/28 at London Stock Exchange.
