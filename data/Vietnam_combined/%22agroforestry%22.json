However, shortcomings in practice demand a comprehensive approach, from institutional reform and enhanced management to greater flexibility in the contracting mechanism. These findings were presented at the seminar \"Current Status and Proposed Solutions for Forestry Land Contracting in Forestry Companies\", co-hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment and the Viet Nam Association of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development Sciences on Friday in H\u00e0 Noi. Several proposals were discussed at the seminar to refine the land contracting policy, aiming for sustainable development in Viet Nam's forestry sector. According to Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Environment Nguyen Quoc Tri, over the past 30 years, forestry companies nation-wide have allocated 458,000ha of land, accounting for 27 per cent of the total managed forestry land. The policy has led to positive changes, mobilising social resources effectively, especially from local residents, forestry companies, and forest management boards, resulting in successful forest plantation models and agroforestry practices on contracted land, Tri told the seminar. As a result, forest protection and land use efficiency have improved, contributing to socio-economic development and better living standards for local communities, he said. Among the different forms of contracting, performance-based and production-step-based contracts where the company maintains control over operations, management, and forest protection have yielded better economic outcomes. Most contractors are local residents with agricultural land and employment, helping alleviate poverty, stabilise settlement patterns, and maintain security and public order.

Over the years, his farm expanded to nearly 500 trees, but unpredictable market shifts often threatened his hard-earned success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like many other farmers, he found that sustainable growth wasn't just about perseverance - it required guidance from agricultural experts and partnerships with businesses that could help navigate market uncertainties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Before establishing the cooperative and joining the supply chain, the market was unstable. There were no commitments from purchasers, no standardised production and prices fluctuated unpredictably,\" said Thi\u00ean, who is also head of Dong Tien Cooperative in Eakar District, in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Things changed when Thi\u00ean and a group of farmers decided to establish their own cooperative in 2012.</p><p>\"The reason for the most stable output is that farmers and cooperatives can connect with businesses for guaranteed purchase and consumption. This forms a three-party collaboration, starting from the production source, which means there is origin traceability,\" he said.</p><p>He noted that in 2025, the price of fresh cocoa beans had surpassed VND80,000 (US$3) per kilogram, with expectations of further increases due to existing contracts that the cooperative's buyers secured with major European consumption markets.</p><p>With 120ha under cocoa cultivation, yielding approximately 300 tonnes of cocoa beans, the Dong Tien Cooperative primarily supplies cocoa - whether in whole buds, fresh beans, or fermented form - to Puratos Grand-Place Indochina (PGPI) and Maison Marou Vietnam.</p><p>PGPI, a joint venture between Puratos Group and Grand-Place Holding, traces its origins to Belgium and made its first investment in Viet Nam more than 20 years ago. Meanwhile, Maison Marou, a gourmet Vietnamese chocolate company headquartered in Ho Ch\u00ed Minh City, was founded in 2011 by Samuel Maruta and Vincent Mourou.</p><p>Expert guidance</p><p>Along with stable purchasing commitments, the Cooperative's 80 member households have also received technical training from the Dak Lak-based Community Development Centre, Helvetas Vietnam and even big purchasers like Puratos to support their transition towards green and sustainable practices.</p><p>\"The shift towards a circular approach is driven by the requirement for products exported to Europe to meet green standards, as this circularity is essential for reducing CO2 emissions,\" Thi\u00ean said.</p><p>\"As head of the cooperative, I require training to ensure our products meet export standards, Vietnamese standards, and any other criteria that best serve the cooperative.\"</p><p>When exporting to Europe, if a product from a single member or producer within a shipment fails to meet the standards, the entire shipment of exports could be rejected.</p><p>\"The challenges posed by European standards are that each farmer must have a unique cultivation area code, they must meticulously follow the prescribed cultivation processes without any omissions, and each farm plot/orchard must be clearly identified,\" Thi\u00ean said.</p><p>\"Currently, when products reach the end consumer, they carry a code, enabling people to know the origin of that shipment.\"</p><p>V\u00f5 Anh Tuan, Vietnam Cocoa purchasing manager at Puratos Grand-Place Indochina, said the company provided technical support for cacao cultivation and care.</p><p>\"When implementing the support project, we then sign an offtake agreement to purchase products and guarantee a minimum output price. Concurrently, there is a seedling support programme for farmers, implemented in collaboration with a third party.\"</p><p>Puratos provides technical support through a dedicated team, with staff assigned to each locality and province. Farmers can reach out to them by phone, or through Zalo and Facebook farmers' community groups for assistance with yield, pest, or disease management.</p><p>Alongside technical support, Puratos implements an annual 'Chocolate Bonus' programme for farmers based on the quantity of their output sold to the company.</p><p>Additionally, according to Tuan, the Cacao Trace scheme is a sustainable cocoa sourcing initiative created by Puratos General Director Gricha Safarian.</p><p>The initiative was born out of a major, persistent problem: the highly skewed profit-sharing in the chocolate and cocoa supply chain, where farmers receive a disproportionately small percentage. Of the total profit from chocolate products sold, only 5-6 per cent is shared with the farmers.</p><p>Consequently, they felt unmotivated to develop cocoa cultivation areas, often cutting down cocoa trees to plant other crops to sustain their livelihoods.</p><p>Safarian considered what could be done to develop cocoa-growing regions more sustainably. He initiated Cacao Trace with the aim of creating chocolate products with superior flavour and greater value, which could then be sold on the market at a higher price than other chocolate brands.</p><p>\"This price difference, instead of going into the company's pockets or funds, is used for value sharing, and paying a bonus to the farmers. This bonus is in addition to the payment they receive through the commitment to purchase their cocoa at a higher price or at a guaranteed minimum market price,\" Tuan explained.</p><p>When Puratos buys cocoa beans, produces chocolate, and sells it to European and Asian markets, the company dedicates a portion of the profit to share back with the farmers.</p><p>\"This is 10 cents per kilogram, which is like a token of appreciation from the customers. The company sends this money to the farmers on behalf of the customers,\" he said.</p><p>This bonus is typically awarded annually in June. This means that when farmers sell to Puratos, the quantity is recorded, and after one year, the bonus is distributed. In 2024, the company paid out approximately $3.58 million in bonuses globally, with Viet Nam's share being around $110,000.</p><p>For farmers like Thi\u00ean, who sold one tonne of roasted cocoa beans to Puratos, he received a bonus of VND3.6 million (nearly $140) in 2024 alone.</p><p>In addition to training on cultivation techniques and traceability, Thi\u00ean is also expanding his knowledge by researching and learning more about techniques for processing cacao byproducts given a considerable amount of this waste.</p><p>Go sustainable, go organic</p><p>On a Sunday afternoon, Dong Dao Dung, lecturer from the Hanoi School of Business Management at the Vietnam National University Hanoi, couldn't hide his joy when sealed bags of organic vegetables grown by farmers in H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Province were directly delivered to households in Cau Giay District of H\u00e0 Noi.</p><p>As usual, like other sources, vegetables from the Dong Suong Organic Vegetable Cooperative are sold to individual customers through groceries.</p><p>He spoke of the 12-year journey accompanying farmers to shift their mindset towards chemical-free production, driven by efforts and even struggles from the farmers themselves.</p><p>\"Previously, farmers had never practised organic farming and believed that without spraying pesticides, it would be ineffective. It took us a whole year of training and analysis to show them which farming practices were scientifically and technically incorrect. Raising awareness about health issues gradually helped farmers recognise the limitations and shift towards organic farming,\" Dung said.</p><p>\"Organic farming initially results in lower yields because pesticides are not used, leading to increased pest infestations. Even when quality is ensured, the process demands excessive labour, as farmers must manually remove pests one by one.\"</p><p>Dong Suong is one of three cooperatives that have successfully implemented the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) in growing organic farms.</p><p>PGS certification is granted to farmers who produce goods in compliance with the proper procedures and regulations for organic production under PGS standards.

The official visit to Viet Nam of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara, which is the first official visit since assumption of office, on October 25-26, 2023 reflects Thailand's continued commitment to further fostering cooperation with Viet Nam. The upcoming official visit to Thailand of Viet Nam's Chairman of the National Assembly Vuong D\u00ecnh Hue on December 7-10, 2023 will pave the way for closer cooperation between the two parliaments. In 2024, both countries look forward to more exchanges of high-level visits, including the official visit to Thailand of Foreign Minister of Viet Nam B\u00f9i Thanh Son, and the official visit to Viet Nam of Prime Minister of Thailand Srettha Thavisin as well as his cabinet to attend the 4th Joint Cabinet Retreat (JCR).</p><p>On the economic front, amid economic deceleration and political headwinds, Thailand and Viet Nam managed to enhance economic ties, with over US$21 billion of two-way trade volume in 2022 through the \"Three Connects\" strategy. The strategy was agreed upon by two leaders in 2022, encompassing Connecting our supply chains, Connecting our grassroots economies, and Connecting our sustainable growth strategies. The strategy has served as an enabler for both countries to materialise the bilateral trade target of $25 billion in 2025.</p><p>As the 9th largest foreign investor in Viet Nam, Thailand's investment footprint has grown from strength to strength, ranging from farming, renewable energy, packaging, retail, distribution, petrochemicals, industrial estates, plastic products, to food processing. Due to the significant increase in Thailand's investment in Viet Nam, Thailand aims to become one of Viet Nam's top 5 foreign investors in the near future. With a view to contributing to regional prosperity and advancing integrated supply chain and production, Thailand and Viet Nam will scale up efforts to align and complement their strengths in Industry 4.0, digital economy, green growth and sustainable development. In order to pursue Thailand's \"proactive diplomacy\", Thailand will work closely with Viet Nam in promoting trade, investment, and tourism to bolster two-way investment.</p><p>On the people-to-people connectivity front, Thailand and Viet Nam have been working together to promote people-to-people exchanges. The resumption of Thai Airways flights between Bangkok and H\u00e0 Noi and Ho Ch\u00ed Minh City from October 29, 2023 will contribute greatly to the promoting of tourism, and economic and cultural ties between the two countries.</p><p>Sharing a common vision in advancing regional peace, stability, and prosperity, Thailand reaffirms our commitments to strengthening cooperation in all aspects and join hands with Viet Nam to take even more proactive and constructive roles in multilateral fora.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["Human development was placed at the heart of these projects with empowerment and self-reliance as the ultimate goal.
