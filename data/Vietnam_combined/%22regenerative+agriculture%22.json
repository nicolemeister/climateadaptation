So what are Nestl\u00e9 Vietnam plans for the upcoming years?</p><p>So far through the NESCAF\u00c9 Plan, we have rejuvenated over 74,000 ha of coffee farms by distributing disease resistant plantlets, spreading good practices.

Philipp: Nescaf\u00e9 Plan is a programme that we have been implementing in many countries, including Viet Nam. We have 12 years of a proven record of accomplishment. As part of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan, we take farmers by hand and train them in regenerative agricultural practices. We have distributed trees and provided financial support and financial literacy to them to manage the farm. This improves farming productivity and farmers' incomes as well as soil health and reduces carbon emissions.", "We have 12 years of a proven record of accomplishment.

We have distributed trees and provided financial support and financial literacy to them to manage the farm. This improves farming productivity and farmers' incomes as well as soil health and reduces carbon emissions. David: Nearly two thirds of our overall emissions come from land use and agriculture. That's why regenerative agriculture and reforestation are a key part of our work. Viet Nam is among the markets where the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan has been most successfully implemented. With our team of agronomists working with farmers in four provinces in the Central Highlands, we have been training them in better and sustainable farming practices that help save water use by 40-60 per cent, reduce the use of pesticides by 30 per cent and cut emissions. More than 330,000 training sessions on sustainable coffee cultivation have been held. The programme has benefitted more than 22,000 farmers in the Central Highlands Provinces, who have been issued the Common Code for the Coffee Community, rejuvenated 63,000ha of old coffee trees, and resulted in many farms engaging in intercropping with three species on average.

How does Nestl\u00e9 monitor the road to regenerative agriculture? David: Monitoring both processes and outcomes will enable us to ensure timely intervention. That is why in Viet Nam we are working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Western Highlands Agriculture and Forestry Science Institute, provincial departments, rural extension services and other organisations. Tackling climate change cannot wait. And we are delighted to be working with the Vietnamese government and are absolutely united in our ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Philipp: Transitioning to regenerative agriculture is not rocket science, but it takes time and commitment for people to convince farmers it is the right thing to do. This is the biggest challenge because in the short term there will be a slight dip in profitability or farm yields. There will be benefits afterwards but that is not immediately obvious. We need incentives and have to help farmers financially transition to regenerative agriculture, or they might not commit to the programme. For our programme, in addition to financial support in the first few years, we are also looking into crop insurance against extreme weather conditions such as droughts, storms and heavy rains.", "David: Monitoring both processes and outcomes will enable us to ensure timely intervention.

It is an evolution, built on the foundations of the work we have been developing since 2010 and taking it to the next level. To help farmers transition to regenerative agriculture, we will invest more than a billion Swiss francs by 2030 in the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan to achieve Nestl\u00e9's net zero commitments of 50 per cent CO2 reduction by 2030 and complete elimination by 2050.

Following its recent registration in Great Britain, farmers in more than 55 countries globally are now able to access this powerful fungicide, with strong sales across continents reflecting farmer demand for effective control of a broad range of crop diseases. The company is on track to achieve one billion US dollars in sales of products containing ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology, marking the first time its active ingredient achieves this milestone in only eight years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Female farmer inspecting soybean crops in field for sclerotinia (sclerotinia sclerotiorum) damage</p><p>\"ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology is a game-changer for modern agriculture and enables farmers to grow crops more sustainably,\" said Ioana Tudor, Global Head of Marketing at Syngenta Crop Protection. \"It represents a significant milestone in our efforts to secure high yields with low impact to the planet and is exciting because of its high levels of consistency and effectiveness. We're very proud that our innovation is delivering such impact.\"</p><p>Worldwide, farmers lose an estimated 10-23 percent of their crops to fungal diseases each year. An additional 10-20 percent is lost post-harvest. In the top five most important calorie crops - rice, wheat, corn, soybeans and potatoes - fungal infections have been estimated to cause yield losses that could feed at least 600 million people every day for a year.</p><p>ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology offers a new solution that effectively fights fusarium head blight in wheat, which produces mycotoxins that contaminate harvests and threaten human and animal health. In addition, it offers a step-change in performance against a wide spectrum of other important diseases, such as septoria in wheat and net blotch in barley. ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology is registered in more than 100 crops including corn, soybean, peanuts, vegetables, potatoes, grapes, tomatoes and fruit crops.</p><p>ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology embodies Syngenta's commitment to sustainable innovation, core to its new Group-wide sustainability priorities announced in April. The effectiveness and long-lasting activity of the technology enable low use rates and potentially fewer sprays especially in leaf spot diseases, while safeguarding beneficial organisms. It is also an important tool for resistance management. The technology works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is essential for fungal respiration, starving the fungi from the energy they need to survive. It is designed to adhere to the plant surface and to penetrate rapidly through the leaf surface - creating a reservoir of active ingredient in the waxy layer of the plant tissue that enables even distribution and long-lasting protection as the plant grows.</p><p>The technology further highlights Syngenta's success with the SDHI (Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) mode of action and the company's ability to effectively design active ingredients that address various farmer challenges. Following its first SDHI seed treatment sedaxane, Syngenta launched its SDHI fungicide isopyrazam which transformed farmers' ability to control sheath blight in rice, and later SOLATENOL\u00ae technology to protect crops against septoria and rusts. In Brazil, SOLATENOL\u00ae technology is today regarded as crucial in farmers' fight against soybean pod anomaly - a new fungal disease which spread within just three years to 12 states across the country since it was first identified.</p><p>Beyond innovation in research and development, Syngenta's success is</p><p>underpinned by its commitment to invest in cutting-edge manufacturing operations. Strong global demand has fueled investments aimed at increasing the efficiency of manufacturing of ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology. These set the foundation for the production of a growing portfolio of formulations containing ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology that target specific grower needs in different markets.</p><p>The latest Syngenta innovation in the SDHI family is TYMIRIUM\u00ae technology, which was launched globally in 2022. In addition to protecting crops against key fungal diseases, TYMIRIUM\u00ae technology provides broad-spectrum protection against plant-parasitic nematodes that reduce global crop yield by an estimated 12 percent a year.</p><p>Hashtag: #Syngenta</p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p><p>About Syngenta Group</p><p>Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

RE:FARM will run from September 2022 to June 2023 and consumers can personally see, touch, and taste the results of the Nespresso's sustainability efforts. The program is the result of a partnership between Nespresso, K11 and Common Farms, a local indoor agri-tech farm, and is aligned with the sustainability initiatives of parent group Nestl\u00e9 SA and its commitment to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nespresso-REFARM2.jpg</p><p>Nespresso has always done things a certain way. Not the easiest way, not the quickest. But the right way. Since its inception over 30 years ago, Nespresso has remained steadfastly committed to making a difference in the world, and sustainability has become a crucial component of its business today. By embedding transformative actions throughout its value chain, such as regenerative agriculture, eco-design, recycling, and circularity, Nespresso strives to bring positive impact to all its stakeholders, from farmers and business partners to consumers. In 2022, Nespresso was certified as a B Corp and joined a global movement of companies doing business responsibly and transparently while maintaining high sustainability standards.</p><p>Capsule-Recycling.jpg</p><p>From Capsule to Cup to Table (and back!) - A Circular Journey</p><p>At RE:FARM, visitors have a unique opportunity to witness Nespresso's sustainable circular system in action. An on-site recycler separates coffee capsules from the coffee grounds and recycles the aluminum to make second life products. Meanwhile, Nespresso's composter turns spent coffee grounds into rich nutrients that will be used to bring life to new produce. Composted coffee grounds serve as an excellent fertilizer and offer numerous benefits in farming, such as improved soil drainage, water retention, and aeration. They also acidify the soil, acting as a natural repellent that deters pests from damaging crops. RE:FARM uses this compost to grow a variety of herbs, microgreens, and edible flowers within self-contained farming units, which are later harvested and sent to selected Nespresso partner restaurants in K11 MUSEA and Rosewood Hong Kong, including Asaya Kitchen, Chaat, Deng G, Yung's Bistro, and other dining establishments that will be joining the project over its nine-month run. As part of the RE:FARM experience, customers are invited to savor the products of Nespresso's circular journey through delicious microgreens and herbs harvested from RE:FARM in specially designed menus available at participating restaurants.</p><p>Through a journey that sees resources travel from farm to capsule to cup, and back to the farm, Nespresso's own circular economy aims to transform the \"take-make-waste\" model into a sustainable system that maintains value and minimizes waste.</p><p>Nespresso hopes to leave visitors with a new understanding and appreciation for circularity through RE:FARM, where end-of-life materials are reimagined and reused as resources rather than waste. In promoting restoration and regeneration, Nespresso continues to hold fast to its commitment to create long-term, positive impact in the world.</p><p>Coffee as a Force for Good</p><p>Nespresso's sustainability journey continues to evolve in new and innovative ways. Through inspiring initiatives such as RE:FARM and an unwavering determination to continuously maximize its positive impact, the company remains committed to caring for communities, the climate, and circularity with the same dedication and passion that goes into every cup of Nespresso coffee. Because it is the right thing to do.</p><p>Located adjacent to Nespresso's existing K11 MUSEA store, RE:FARM will be open from September 2022 to June 2023.

During the past year, Blue Bottle has taken the following actions:</p><p>Coffee Sourcing: Blue Bottle is completing its first round of sustainability audits across the majority of its coffee purchasing. Audit reports will assist Blue Bottle in integrating climate targets into its work with coffee suppliers.</p><p>Electricity: Blue Bottle reduced GHG emissions associated with its electricity usage first in the United States and Japan by purchasing renewable energy certificates for a portion of cafes and one production site. </p><p>Dairy: Blue Bottle led the change to introduce oat milk in its Asia markets, having long offered oat milk at no extra charge in U.S. cafes. In June 2021, test cafes in Northern and Southern California markets invoked oat milk as the default in milk-based drinks for in-cafe and mobile orders, resulting in 8% less cow's milk use in these cafes.</p><p>Waste: Blue Bottle is on track to achieve zero waste operations for half its U.S. cafes by the end of 2021, with a goal of reaching all U.S. cafes by 2023. This target requires cafes to divert 90% of their waste from landfill, incineration, or the environment. Blue Bottle's Jackson Square cafe opened this spring with zero waste operations, reaching a 98% diversion rate in its first month. In 2022, Blue Bottle will scale zero waste operations to its U.S. production sites and begin implementation in Asia.</p><p>\"We invite guests to join us in forging positive change-from wasting less and reusing more to adopting new product offerings with lower environmental footprints-we are committed to accelerating progress but cannot do this alone,\" said Strovink. \"We hope our guests will join us in taking bold steps on climate action, one cup of coffee and one day at a time.\"</p><p>For more information on Blue Bottle's sustainability efforts, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/sustainability\">www.blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/sustainability</url>.
