This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system. By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future. This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.

Visiting the property, it was great to see the overall soil strength and moisture in the soil profile and the cattle looked extremely healthy. Regenerative agriculture focuses on enhancing soil by restoring five key landscape functions: solar energy capture; water cycle efficiency; soil-mineral dynamics; ecosystem diversity; and human-social connections. In practice, this involves minimising soil disturbance through no-till methods, maintaining surface vegetation (green growing cover is most effective) and keeping living roots in the soil for as long as possible. Regenerative principles also focus on enhancing soil biological diversity by using a mix of perennial pasture species and caring for native vegetation.

If you notice pain that worsens as you run, consider stopping to walk for a bit, stretch it out, and try to resume running at a slower pace.

The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products.

As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.

Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe.

The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products.

As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.

The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.

Queensland graziers face greater soil heath challenges than other parts of the Anglosphere, according to world soil expert Nicole Masters, but there are two quick steps they can take to improve the ecosystems that support pastures. Ms Masters flew into the Burnett and Wide Bay regions from Montana, US, in early February to present at forums on regenerative agriculture organised by the Burnett Mary Regional Group. Australian soils require more concentrated effort than what people would do in perhaps Canada or New Zealand,\" she said. What I have noticed in a lot of these systems is [plant matter] is breaking down fast because the soil is very bacterially dominated. The degradation of soil in Australia is a barrier to its health, in terms of how poor soils are now and how low organic matter is. There were two key steps Queensland graziers could take to understand their soil improvement journey.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale. Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241.", "Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale. Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system. By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.

The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.

This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.

Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030. The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale. Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241.", "Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale. Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system. By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future. This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.
