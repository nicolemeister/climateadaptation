Our final game was set for Friday, October 11 in Shizuoka, about an hour south of Tokyo - right in the path of Typhoon Hagibis which was expected to make landfall the following day. We'd heard the reports that a typhoon was coming, and in the days leading up to it we were frequently checking the updates as we feared we wouldn't be able to get to Tokyo to make our flight home on Sunday. When we arrived in Shizuoka on Thursday, we booked seats on an early shinkansen (bullet train) to Tokyo, thinking if we left by 8am, we'd be in Tokyo before the worst of the typhoon and, hopefully, before the trains were suspended. The following day, game day, we went straight to the train station to check that the trains were still running, only to see a big sign - all trains were suspended for Saturday. We spent the next few hours wandering the streets of Shizuoka trying to decide what to do. Our flight home from Tokyo was scheduled for 5pm Sunday.", "It seemed as if the storm had passed and it wasn't as bad as predicted. We'd survived the typhoon! The next day saw blue skies and streets once again filled with people; there were even markets on. It was hard to imagine a typhoon had just come through. However, we were lucky. We were in a higher area that escaped much of the damage and devastation that Typhoon Hagibis brought. So far the death toll is 74 people, and counting, with more than a dozen still missing. More than 5000 people are still in evacuation centres and more than 12,000 homes remain without power or running water. Typhoon Hagibis also caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with a number of trains damaged by flooding. Calum and I were two of those people affected by transport disruptions; the biggest impact to us was that our flight ended up being cancelled, which, in the scheme of things is pretty insignificant. In fact, that cancellation gave us an extra three days in Japan.", "It was hard to imagine a typhoon had just come through. However, we were lucky.

As far as they are concerned, cup organisers have the power to overlook the regulations in order for matches to be fulfilled.

They also believe that should the destruction wrought by what are predicted to be 241km/h winds render the Yokohama Stadium unfit for purpose then there are several alternative venues within the city where the match could be restaged. Much of this flies in the face of World Rugby's assessments.

Isi Naisarani's yellow for an accidental jaw bump in a clean-out against Georgia on Friday night was the 28th card (27 yellow and one red) against the Wallabies since the 2015 Rugby World Cup. No other top nation has given away that many so, yes, discipline is a finger-crossing, toe-crossing lottery.</p><p>2 Start matches at halftime. The Wallabies are stronger finishers with a collective 87-25 edge in second- half play against Fiji, Wales, Uruguay and Georgia. It reflects fitness gains, some excellent super-sub efforts from Matt Toomua, Will Genia and co, too many errors early in games and adapting with some good halftime chat.</p><p>3 The Wallabies are going to run. They will back their high-passing game but a little less of the dumb stuff please. Why you'd try to run out of your quarter in the wet against Georgia and have hooker Tolu Latu knock on in front of the posts is beyond us. Find the right balance. More ball to Marika Koroibete. His solo try against Georgia was a dazzler.</p><p>4 The forwards can go toe-to-toe with England. There have been huge gains at the lineout. Lock Izack Rodda stole three Georgian lineouts and Latu is nailing long throws which means a great platform to run a tricky set play attack from. Scrum \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 rock solid.</p><p>5 Goalkicking. England's Owen Farrell just wins it if it comes down to a tight duel of penalty goals in the final 15 minutes.

The exception is a team such as Ireland, who have excellent ball security but traditionally a less expansive attacking game than a side like the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia have turned the ball over more times than any tier-one team in 2019, doing so 19 times a game.

Last weekend, Australians Adam Coleman (204cm) and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (198cm) and Argentinian lock Tomas Lavanini (201cm), all found themselves carded for high shots.</p><p>It's just what comes naturally when a player is so tall. While a shorter player like, for instance, David Pocock, admits he naturally tackles around the chest, it is particularly difficult for the basketball types, particularly when the ball-carrier ducks - as you tend to do when you are about to be monstered by someone that imposing.</p><p>Now Rory Arnold, who at 208cm takes \"tall, dark and handsome\" to ridiculous extremes, is beginning to realise that his imposing physique has become a liability. He was given a foretaste of it last year, when he was suspended for three matches for a high shot on Lions five-eighth Elton Jantjes in Johannesburg and while he has managed to escape censure this season, there certainly have been a couple of close calls.</p><p>Finally, Wallabies coach -Michael Cheika has recognised publicly what he must have -realised privately all along, that his team, while trained to tackle around the midriff, was consistently straying high.</p><p>\"No matter how you see the pictures, the penalties are real,\" said Cheika. \"You've got to do something because, whether it's truth or perception, we're getting the arm raised against us and we're losing blokes to the bin. So we have to improve the tackle area as a whole.\" Arnold admits he has been working on the tackling problem for some time. \"It is a point in my game that I have to think about a bit,\" he said. \"Over the past few weeks, there have been a lot of cards thrown out there and it puts a lot of pressure on your side \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 playing with 14 blokes for a while.\" Most critics would be suggesting that the Wallabies simply have to tackle lower, and there certainly is a case to be made for that based on how Japan are defending at this World Cup.

They do not have the big men, therefore coach Jamie Joseph has cut their cloth accordingly.</p><p>But the Wallabies have brought one of the most formidable teams to the World Cup and they want to make the most of their physicality. Coleman emphasised that point against Uruguay last weekend in Oita as he effectively frogmarched the opposition's No 8 Manuel Diana 10m down the field after wrapping him up in a high but legal tackle.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, I want to play aggressively,\" said Arnold. \"That's the way I play.

Puplick doesn't have any legal qualifications but it turns out he also can't use a calendar.Puplick mistakenly believed that Singh was given a series of warnings not to reoffend and gave a commitment he wouldn't.

So it has always been an advantage to be tall in rugby - until now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Suddenly, as World Rugby launches its blitz on head-high tackling it is the taller players, those who stretch the tape out 2m or more, who are coming more and more under scrutiny. Last weekend, Australians Adam Coleman (204cm) and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (198cm) and Argentinian lock Tomas Lavanini (201cm), all found themselves carded for high shots.</p><p>It's just what comes naturally when a player is so tall. While a shorter player like, for instance, David Pocock, admits he naturally tackles around the chest, it is particularly difficult for the basketball types, particularly when the ball-carrier ducks - as you tend to do when you are about to be monstered by someone that imposing.</p><p>Now Rory Arnold, who at 208cm takes \"tall, dark and handsome\" to ridiculous extremes, is beginning to realise that his imposing physique has become a liability. He was given a foretaste of it last year, when he was suspended for three matches for a high shot on Lions five-eighth Elton Jantjes in Johannesburg and while he has managed to escape censure this season, there certainly have been a couple of close calls.</p><p>Finally, Wallabies coach -Michael Cheika has recognised publicly what he must have -realised privately all along, that his team, while trained to tackle around the midriff, was consistently straying high.</p><p>\"No matter how you see the pictures, the penalties are real,\" said Cheika. \"You've got to do something because, whether it's truth or perception, we're getting the arm raised against us and we're losing blokes to the bin. So we have to improve the tackle area as a whole.\" Arnold admits he has been working on the tackling problem for some time. \"It is a point in my game that I have to think about a bit,\" he said. \"Over the past few weeks, there have been a lot of cards thrown out there and it puts a lot of pressure on your side \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 playing with 14 blokes for a while.\" Most critics would be suggesting that the Wallabies simply have to tackle lower, and there certainly is a case to be made for that based on how Japan are defending at this World Cup. They have been exemplary as they have cut players down. But they are merely making a virtue of necessity. They do not have the big men, therefore coach Jamie Joseph has cut their cloth accordingly.</p><p>But the Wallabies have brought one of the most formidable teams to the World Cup and they want to make the most of their physicality. Coleman emphasised that point against Uruguay last weekend in Oita as he effectively frogmarched the opposition's No 8 Manuel Diana 10m down the field after wrapping him up in a high but legal tackle.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, I want to play aggressively,\" said Arnold. \"That's the way I play. I guess it is mainly those taller boys who are getting pinged for the high shots. As locks and taller men, we have to focus on getting our shots down. Because at the end of the day there is no contact with the head and it's about player safety.</p><p>\"Player safety is the most important thing. It is up to us to get our tackles down and keep working on that.\" The storm of controversy over tackling is taking place against the background of a real storm, as Super Typhoon Hagibis bears down on the Japanese islands. It has been rated \"the strongest storm on the planet\" at present, -although it is difficult for the people of Tokyo to take it seriously as they basked on Wednesday in a picture-postcard day. Besides, there are, on average, 19 typhoons per season and most of them amount to very little.But if Hagibis does bear down on Yokohama this weekend, it could impact on the England-France clash on Saturday to decide Pool C and Sunday's Japan-Scotland match to determine Pool A. In the event of a washout, which would then give two points to each side, England, not France, would be confirmed as Australia's quarter-final opponents. But it could prove a godsend to Japan, allowing them to move into the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time.</p>", "publisher": "The Australian", "instances": ["I guess it is mainly those taller boys who are getting pinged for the high shots.

Like the two late changes in their match-day 23, with Adam Coleman and Michael Hooper both being scratched for \"niggles\". That threw the door open to Rob Simmons and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto to come into the reserves. It's a significant change because it now means that Simmons will get to play his 100th Test before this World Cup is over, which would have been no certainty otherwise. He will become the 11th Wallaby to reach this milestone and perhaps the one most underrated.</p><p>\"The Man from Theodore,\" David Pocock called him and certainly the traits they value in that part of Queensland 550-odd kilometres northwest of Brisbane - trust and dependability - are reflected in Simmons' rugby.</p><p>\"He has guided me on my football journey,\" said Test lock Izack Rodda, who studied the mysteries of lineouts at Simmons' feet in his early days at the Reds.</p><p>\"Great bloke. I'm happy for him and his family.\" Even though they cannot now miss out on the quarter-finals following Wales' defeat of Fiji, there is a mathematical chance that Australia could still emerge as winner of Pool D. All that is needed to that to occur is a Wallabies' win over Georgia. Oh, and for Uruguay to beat Wales.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, the Wallabies will finish second in Pool D regardless and will now meet England in the quarter-final in Oita next Saturday. Eddie Jones' side was spared the ordeal of playing France in Yokohama on Saturday to determine who would win Pool C. When the match was abandoned, both sides received two points, so it really was \"the blues\" for France. On the other hand, they might figure they have a better chance of getting past Wales than of beating a Wallabies outfit that has become as unpredictable as they are.</p><p>Pocock, who has taken over the captaincy for this match, had good reason to stress the importance of staying focused. The Georgians have never claimed a tier-one scalp and their Kiwi coach, Milton Haig, let it be known that the Australians would do nicely.</p><p>\"They've picked a pretty strong side,\" said Haig. \"It's similar to what played against Wales. We understand how difficult the job is going to be to create an upset but, again, this is a World Cup and it's sport and those types of things do happen in sport and everybody loves them.\" Michael Cheika has spoken glowingly about the competition for places in the Australian side but this is where the rubber meets the road - Pocock going head to head with fellow loose forwards Jack Dempsey and Isi Naisarani for two backrow spot once Hooper returns; Taniela Tupou gunning for a place in the quarter-final match day 23 currently occupied by Sekope Kepu, his roommate and mentor; Nic White trying to keep Will Genia at bay at halfback. And Matt Toomua will be attempting something that has so far proved impossible at this World Cup, getting picked at five-eighth for Australia two weeks running.</p><p>Cheika has gone out to the end of a very long limb in backing Kurtley Beale for the fullback position here but this surely is his last chance to play with real conviction. He always tends to play well in these matches, where the opposition might not be so well organised in defence, but it won't be Beale's attack that will be most harshly judged.</p><p>He needs the Georgians to bomb him like there is no tomorrow, and to take each high ball with aplomb - because that is exactly what England will do next week if he is selected.</p><p>GEORGIAON FRONT FOOT P30</p>", "publisher": "The Australian", "instances": ["World Rugby took the unprecedented step of abandoning two major pool matches because of Super Typhoon Hagibis yet the only heavy weather the Wallabies are preparing for is what they expect their final round-robin opponent, Georgia, to throw at them on Friday night in Shizuoka.

Indeed, the first people to realise something catastrophic was about to happen to their country during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami were the passengers on the 33 bullet trains - the Shinkansen - whose emergency brakes were activated remotely, prompted by the seismometer which detected the earth quake 12-15 seconds before it hit. That's making technology work for you in a natural disaster.</p><p>The Japanese experience, on average, 19 typhoons per season - which runs from July through to October - so they have this situation well in hand, on a par with fire services in Australia. And as someone who recently had cause to sing the praises of my local fire services as bushfires bore down on my suburb, you quickly come to realise that they are acting to keep you alive.</p><p>So it all seemed a little churlish when the London Sun blasted World Rugby for having the audacity to bring a World Cup into Japan during a period when typhoons might occur. A bit like bemoaning the Ashes series being held in Australia in 2021-22 during the height of the fire season.</p><p>Still, until the cancellations, nothing like this had ever happened in the 32-year history of the World Cup. The only thing that was even close was when the 1995 semi-final between France and hosts South Africa was delayed by an hour while \"ground staff\" - which looked awfully like a lot of women sweeping the water off the field while a lot of important-looking men stood around directing them - got the ground ready. Had the match been called off, France would have won. Needless to say, the game went ahead and the Springboks won an epic cliffhanger. Funny that.</p><p>That's another reason, incidentally, to tip your hat to the Japanese. If their match on Sunday against Scotland is abandoned, they go through to the quarters for the first time and the Scots go home, no doubt grumbling. So far it hasn't been cancelled. Of course, if the weather turns particularly nasty, it still might be called off but the organisers are letting Mother Nature have her say.</p><p>It's the fans who were hit the hardest by the decision to cancel the England-France and NZ-Italy games, those who might have paid a fortune for a once-in-a-lifetime experience and were drastically short-changed.</p><p>Like them, I am confused that the matches could not have been transferred indoors. Australia played two of their pool matches under closed roofs, at Sapporo and Oita, and given the importance of the matches cancelled, I can't understand why the teams weren't relocated en masse to a ground where they could get the game played.</p><p>It would be a great shame, not to mention a financial disaster, if they had to be played in front of empty houses but at least the result would have been valid.</p><p>This way, Italy can gripe that they were dudded out of a quarter-final spot. But it might have made their captain Sergio Parisse's gripes just a little more believable had Italy just once, in the 14 times they have played New Zealand, come within a converted try of their opponent.</p><p>The question now is whether England and New Zealand will benefit from having a two-week break between matches. No doubt Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen, the All Blacks coach, will complain about how the momentum of their sides was broken, how they had intended to use the cancelled matches to give further game time to players returning from injury, like Brodie Retallick.</p><p>All very true. Don't believe a word of it.</p><p>If there is one common refrain from all coaches at World Cups - I'm sure I can even recall Jones coming out with it when he was Wallabies coach for the 2003 tournament - they all say how difficult it is to win the thing because their footballers have to play seven Tests one after another.</p><p>Well, now they don't. But that only applies to the two sides that arguably need least help of all, England and the All Blacks.</p><p>It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good and almost before World Rugby had cancelled their match against France - almost as if they might have had some foreknowledge of it and, indeed, might have participated in the decision-making process - England were on their way south to Miyazaki, on the island of Kyushu, where it just so happens they will play Australia next Saturday at Oita. It was, as well, the spot where the England team prepared for the World Cup so Jones has found a way to take what could have been a vexing twist to his plans and make them somehow work for him.</p><p>Jones will, as well, have an Australian playmate to keep him company this week.

And if you think, Mr Stuart, that Jones has invited you up in complete ignorance of the fact that his side is about to play Australia, well more fool you.</p><p>Still, amid all his usual shenanigans, Jones did come out with one comment that clearly came straight from his heart. \"We are in the midst of a great tournament and we shouldn't let this cast a shadow over it.\"Couldn't agree more.</p>", "publisher": "The Australian", "instances": ["On the same day that Rugby World Cup officials were announcing the cancellation of two matches because of the impending arrival of arguably the biggest typhoon to hit these parts in some time, Tokyo experienced not one but two earthquakes.

The Japanese experience, on average, 19 typhoons per season - which runs from July through to October - so they have this situation well in hand, on a par with fire services in Australia. And as someone who recently had cause to sing the praises of my local fire services as bushfires bore down on my suburb, you quickly come to realise that they are acting to keep you alive. So it all seemed a little churlish when the London Sun blasted World Rugby for having the audacity to bring a World Cup into Japan during a period when typhoons might occur."]}, {"relevance_score": 64, "title": "Samurai lets his mask slip on the eve of battle", "published": "2019-10-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Known for his ruthless precision, England coach Eddie Jones has shown his human side in Japan, writes Georgina Robinson.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before England coach Eddie Jones took his seat at the top table in a packed hotel function room, high on the hills overlooking Beppu Bay on Thursday, he thanked each of the three women translators seated at a table off to the side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He sat down, unfolded a piece of paper and read out a message in Japanese, sending his \"heartfelt condolences\" to the families affected by Typhoon Hagibis, the damaging super storm that swept across Japan's main island of Honshu, killing almost 80 people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He congratulated Japan on their historic World Cup win over Scotland in Yokohama on Sunday, less than 18 hours after Hagibis ripped through the city.</p><p>\"The Japanese people have a very strong fighting spirit, and I wish them the earliest possible recovery,\" Jones finished.</p><p>Switching back to English, and his unmistakable strine, he drew the veil again. \"Right, let's go.\"</p><p>The next 10 minutes was trademark Jones.

On the eve of England's blockbuster Six Nations clash with Wales last year, in which Patchell was wearing the No.10 jersey in just his fourth Test start, Jones unsheathed his blade and struck.</p><p>\"He's a young guy, he's inexperienced and is their third-choice 10. He will have to find guys around him to help because he'll be under some heat,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'd imagine that when (Welsh captain) Alun Wyn Jones and the guys go down for breakfast on Saturday morning, they'll be looking at him thinking: can this kid handle the pressure today?</p><p>\"It's a big ask ... one hell of an experience for the kid. I hope he has the bottle on Saturday.\"</p><p>Patchell crumbled, England won 12-6.</p><p>Two years earlier, in June 2016, he'd turned the blowtorch on his homeland, and two Randwick stablemates, to devastating effect. In Australia for the first time as England coach, fresh off a Six Nations championship win, Jones's squad dismantled Australia - and Australian confidence - over three Tests.</p><p>He'd taken every advantage possible, using a juvenile line of questioning from former Wallabies back rower and Randwick club mate Stephen Hoiles as a chance to distance himself from Australia and prove to England where his loyalties lay.</p><p>\"You've seen the promotions Fox Sports have been running this week and the kind of questions we get - it is quite demeaning, disrespectful to the team, so we're not going to let this opportunity pass,\" Jones said.</p><p>In the lead-up to the series he'd threatened \"Bodyline rugby\" and marshalled his players to deliver it. The scorelines were 39-28, 23-7 and 44-40 in the dead rubber. The Michael Cheika Wallabies, less than a year clear of an inspiring, if ultimately unsuccessful World Cup campaign, were bleeding out.</p><p>And so it went. Jones took England on an unmatched winning streak, came within a Test loss of losing the job after the six-game losing streak that followed, and rose from the ashes in a way no Test coach of a tier one nation has done before. In the 17 Tests since England's 2018 form dip, they have lost just three.</p><p>He arrived in Japan on a mission.

The eyes, trained to assess and destroy, still gleam.</p><p>But on at least three occasions during this World Cup, 20 teams whittled down to eight, with three weekends of knockout rugby to go, Jones has let the mask slip.</p><p>He fought back tears in Sapporo when a journalist asked him what it meant to be coaching England at a World Cup in his mother's homeland. He was emotional in his first public comments on the death of close mate and Randwick rugby legend Jeff Sayle.</p><p>And this week, in the function room in Beppu, with upwards of 30 recording devices blinking at him in anticipation of the verbal barrage surely - surely! - on its way ahead of England's quarter-final showdown with Australia, Jones was reflective.</p><p>\"I just think we've always been mates, we just don't see each other very often,\" he said of Cheika. \"I live in Bagshot, so it's pretty hard to get from Bagshot to Coogee for a coffee. So we don't see each other but I'm proud of him. I reckon he's done a great job for Australian rugby. He has his heart on his sleeve, he gives it everything he's got; you can't ask for more than that.\"</p><p>Sayle's death was the obvious trigger for the newfound restraint. Jones contemplated flying home for his funeral on the eve of England's toughest pool game against France. He ruled it out, before the typhoon changed everyone's plans.</p><p>But it wasn't just Sayle. As Jones sat before the cameras and lights there was a poignant sense of a career - a life - that had come full circle.</p><p>He is the son of an Australian soldier and a Japanese interpreter. He was born in Burnie, Tasmania, but raised in Sydney. He married a Japanese woman, Hiroko, after the pair met while teaching at Sydney's International Grammar School. They raised their daughter, Chelsea, who now works at Rugby Australia, bilingual.</p><p>Jones's time coaching Japan created the precursor to the 2019 side that swept aside Ireland and Scotland to secure a historic quarter-final berth this weekend. It was a spell that resurrected his career after a bitter departure from Australia in 2005 and the clincher for the England job.</p><p>Now he's sitting in Japan, a country to which he remains deeply connected, coaching England against the country he loves which, at one stage, didn't love him back. And there's a dearly departed mate to whom he could not say goodbye.</p><p>\"There will be a bloke in the sky (Sayle) who will be quite excited about Michael and I coaching against each other this week,\" Jones told the function room.</p><p>The samurai's still in there, preparing his troops for battle against the Wallabies.

There was even a specific tour to New Zealand and Australia where Japan's top players were able to compete in matches against Super Rugby 'B' sides - as well as train for hours on end as a cohesive unit.</p><p>\"It was a shock to the system,\" Moore says. \"We were doing six training sessions a day.

As the constitutional monarch, he formally appoints the prime minister and chief justice of the Supreme Court, and performs other ceremonial functions but, unlike Queen Elizabeth, he is not the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</p><p>\"He can express himself only through carefully weighted utterances and symbolic gestures,\" says Dr Lionel Babicz, lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Sydney.</p><p>\"When I think about the important responsibility I have assumed, I am filled with a sense of solemnity,\" Naruhito said in May.</p><p>As the first modern Japanese emperor to have been born in peacetime, the mild-mannered Naruhito is more distanced from the war shadows hanging over his father. He is also the first emperor to have a university degree, to speak several languages, to have posed for selfies with members of the public and to have spent time living abroad, which included a visit to Melbourne in 1974.</p><p>A musician (viola) and historian, he spent two years in Oxford researching medieval forms of transport for the River Thames (and wrote a memoir about it called The Thames and I). He also, famously, learned how to wash his own laundry.</p><p>What kind of emperor will he be?</p><p>\"It is widely expected that Emperor Naruhito will follow in his father's footsteps,\" says Dr Babicz, \"being the symbol of the state and remaining close to the people - but, of course, he will also adapt to the new issues of the 21st century. We may see the emperor symbolising a new ecological agenda, for instance.\"</p><p>Naruhito is regarded as an expert on water issues. In a 2013 speech to the United Nations on the lessons that can be learned from water disasters, he mixed the pragmatic and the poetic, citing a popular essay written in 1212 by a Shinto priest who had recorded details of disasters he witnessed.</p><p>\"A Japanese modern epigram says that a disaster strikes when people lose their memory of the previous one,\" said Naruhito. \"The message [the writer] sent across the centuries strikes us when we are facing a similar situation after disasters.\"</p><p>He also explained a theme of the priest's work rather poignantly. \"Let me at this point explain to you a key word of Japanese philosophy - 'hakanasa', usually translated as 'evanescence' or 'fleetingness'. A good example of this is the blossoming of the cherry blossom in spring - a symbol which you all might recognise of Japan. The blossoms are beautiful but they fall and are dispersed in the wind only after a few days. For Japanese, there is a certain sadness in this and cherry blossoms are fleeting just as life is.\"</p><p>Like his father, Naruhito married a commoner, Owada Masako, in 1993. Educated in economics and law at Harvard, Oxford and in Tokyo, she was one of only three women out of 800 applicants to pass an entrance exam to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987, leading to a high-flying diplomatic career, which she reluctantly dropped to become a princess.</p><p>Reportedly facing intense pressure to produce a male heir, she suffered stress-induced \"adjustment disorder\". At one point, Naruhito broke with protocol to defend her, saying she had \"totally exhausted herself\" trying to adjust and there had been moves to \"negate her career and her personality\".</p><p>Perhaps it is a matter of social mores catching up with Masako. When she spoke in fluent English with Melania Trump during a visit by the Trumps to Tokyo in May, there was an outpouring of admiration on social media, The New York Times reported. \"She is awesome and cool,\" tweeted a fan.</p><p>\"Though the previous emperor and empress were seen as being close to the people, these two seem even closer,\" Hideya Kawanishi, an assistant history professor at Nagoya University, told Reuters. \"I think it's because they appear to be more like ordinary people.\"</p><p>The couple's only child, 17-year-old Princess Aiko, will now have a higher profile but is not in line to the throne.

In April, Prince Naruhito, a 59-year-old multilingual former Oxford scholar took the imperial baton from his father, the 85-year-old Akihito, in a brief ceremony in Tokyo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the world's oldest continuous monarchy ushered in its new boss - its 126th - so too did Naruhito's ascension to the throne herald a new era, literally. The Heisei era, meaning achieving peace, belonged to Akihito's reign; the Reiwa era, beautiful change, now marks Naruhito's time. But the process of becoming emperor involves many steps. The next one, to which a swag of world leaders and Japan's nearly 127 million people will bear witness today, is Naruhito's enthronement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How is an emperor enthroned?</p><p>Naruhito will wear a traditional robe and towering headdress for the ceremony at the Imperial Palace's Hall of Pine. He will step into the Takamikura throne, an elaborate 6.5-metre-high pavilion topped with gold and lacquerware, and sit on a cushioned chair.</p><p>Beside him will be a sword and a jewel, two of the so-called three sacred treasures that symbolise</p><p>the legitimacy of the emperor.</p><p>(The other one is a mirror called Yata-no-Kagami, which is kept at the Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest site in Japan's indigenous religion, Shinto.)</p><p>The new Empress Masako will be seated be seat on the throne nearby. Naruhito will declare his succession to the world and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will lead three cheers, bringing the 30-minute ceremony to a close.</p><p>While a 10-minute ceremony on May 1 signified Naruhito would inherit the throne and his father's abdication had come into effect, this time he is making it official he is emperor. A parade through Tokyo has been postponed until November 10 out of deference to the victims of Typhoon Hagibis, which led to more than 80 deaths in October.</p><p>Still, with 900 guests from around the world being treated to a banquet at a Tokyo hotel, there will be plenty of politicking.</p><p>How big a deal are emperors in Japan?</p><p>Big. The imperial family can trace its first head back to Emperor Jimmu in 660BC.</p><p>Historically, Japan's imperial family was believed to be descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu who sits above the 8 million \"gods of all things\" in Shinto.</p><p>In November, for example, Naruhito will perform a thanksgiving ritual called the Daijosai, in which he offers rice and sake to his imperial ancestors and prays for good times for his people.</p><p>The government is reportedly forking out more than $200 million on imperial events this year.</p><p>Japan's pacifist constitution of 1947 calls the emperor \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power\".</p><p>The emperor's powers are, of course, limited. As the constitutional monarch, he formally appoints the prime minister and chief justice of the Supreme Court, and performs other ceremonial functions but, unlike Queen Elizabeth, he is not the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</p><p>\"He can express himself only through carefully weighted utterances and symbolic gestures,\" says Dr Lionel Babicz, lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Sydney.</p><p>\"When I think about the important responsibility I have assumed, I am filled with a sense of solemnity,\" Naruhito said in May.</p><p>As the first modern Japanese emperor to have been born in peacetime, the mild-mannered Naruhito is more distanced from the war shadows hanging over his father. He is also the first emperor to have a university degree, to speak several languages, to have posed for selfies with members of the public and to have spent time living abroad, which included a visit to Melbourne in 1974.</p><p>A musician (viola) and historian, he spent two years in Oxford researching medieval forms of transport for the River Thames (and wrote a memoir about it called The Thames and I). He also, famously, learned how to wash his own laundry.</p><p>What kind of emperor will he be?</p><p>\"It is widely expected that Emperor Naruhito will follow in his father's footsteps,\" says Dr Babicz, \"being the symbol of the state and remaining close to the people - but, of course, he will also adapt to the new issues of the 21st century. We may see the emperor symbolising a new ecological agenda, for instance.\"</p><p>Naruhito is regarded as an expert on water issues. In a 2013 speech to the United Nations on the lessons that can be learned from water disasters, he mixed the pragmatic and the poetic, citing a popular essay written in 1212 by a Shinto priest who had recorded details of disasters he witnessed.</p><p>\"A Japanese modern epigram says that a disaster strikes when people lose their memory of the previous one,\" said Naruhito. \"The message [the writer] sent across the centuries strikes us when we are facing a similar situation after disasters.\"</p><p>He also explained a theme of the priest's work rather poignantly. \"Let me at this point explain to you a key word of Japanese philosophy - 'hakanasa', usually translated as 'evanescence' or 'fleetingness'. A good example of this is the blossoming of the cherry blossom in spring - a symbol which you all might recognise of Japan. The blossoms are beautiful but they fall and are dispersed in the wind only after a few days. For Japanese, there is a certain sadness in this and cherry blossoms are fleeting just as life is.\"</p><p>Like his father, Naruhito married a commoner, Owada Masako, in 1993. Educated in economics and law at Harvard, Oxford and in Tokyo, she was one of only three women out of 800 applicants to pass an entrance exam to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987, leading to a high-flying diplomatic career, which she reluctantly dropped to become a princess.</p><p>Reportedly facing intense pressure to produce a male heir, she suffered stress-induced \"adjustment disorder\". At one point, Naruhito broke with protocol to defend her, saying she had \"totally exhausted herself\" trying to adjust and there had been moves to \"negate her career and her personality\".</p><p>Perhaps it is a matter of social mores catching up with Masako. When she spoke in fluent English with Melania Trump during a visit by the Trumps to Tokyo in May, there was an outpouring of admiration on social media, The New York Times reported. \"She is awesome and cool,\" tweeted a fan.</p><p>\"Though the previous emperor and empress were seen as being close to the people, these two seem even closer,\" Hideya Kawanishi, an assistant history professor at Nagoya University, told Reuters. \"I think it's because they appear to be more like ordinary people.\"</p><p>The couple's only child, 17-year-old Princess Aiko, will now have a higher profile but is not in line to the throne. The absence of a male heir in the imperial family for many years caused hand-wringing, including moves to change the law to make it possible for firstborn females to inherit the throne.</p><p>But when Naruhito's younger brother, Prince Akishino, had a son in 2006, Hisahito, the reforms were promptly shelved.</p><p>with AAP, AP, Reuters,</p><p>Bloomberg and NHK</p>", "publisher": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "instances": ["Beside him will be a sword and a jewel, two of the so-called three sacred treasures that symbolisethe legitimacy of the emperor.

The following might have been titled '10 Things I Hate About Union', but the 2019 tournament has defied my prejudices and I have been enjoying it - in a mixed, head-scratching, frustrating kind of way. It hit me that the World Cup is, for better and worse, a metaphor for our times. Here are 10 ways the RWC reflects a world in dis/union:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It really is too long</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But isn't that the truth about all entertainment? Once a formula has been found, it gets milked to saturation point. Married At First Sight, The Block, that singing show with the prawn head: if it works, it's got to be worked to death. There might be economies of scale in banging us over the head with bloat, but there are limits. A writer friend of mine was recently asked to blurb a new book. He said (not for the blurb) that it was good, but 200 pages too long. Which brought to mind something the great author David Malouf once said about every book he read: what they all had in common was that they should be shorter.</p><p>People are getting bigger</p><p>Answer me this. You go to a school rugby match and there are a dozen kids 190cm tall and weighing 100kg. They're 18 years old and the size of the 1980s Wallabies. And then their parents wander up and they are five-foot-six and 10 stone. How did young people get to be so enormous? Transfer this to the World Cup and I reckon at post-match functions there is a land of the giants (players) mingling with the pygmies (their parents). The rugby world is hurtling towards one-tonne forward packs. No wonder the scrums, like cars, have to be de-powered. They and the children driving them are just getting too big.</p><p>Migration enriches all</p><p>A question doing the rounds at the Rugby World Cup has been, what if all those Pacific Island-heritage players for Australia, New Zealand and England could play for their 'home' countries? Then we might see a completely different World Cup. But what this overlooks is that these footballers are now playing for their home countries. To align nation with race, to differentiate between 'true' Australians or Englishmen and 'imports' is to take the world back to dark and dangerous times and, speaking of stupid, ideologies that are proven failures. Look at the top performers in this World Cup, all rainbow nations. It's no accident why multicultural outfits perform better.</p><p>People are faster and stronger, just not smarter</p><p>One of the interesting observations about Jordan Petaia's exciting debut for the Wallabies against Uruguay was Paul Cully noting that the 19-year-old \"put his older teammates to shame with his rugby IQ\". You would have to agree that this Rugby World Cup has shown unprecedented levels of athleticism, power, speed and dumb-arse plays. Did anyone see Ireland play Japan? If they hadn't already invented Irish jokes, they would have to now. But it's not just the Irish. Every game provides a highlight reel of dumb kicks, dumb passes, dumb phases, dumb rolling mauls, dumb decisions. Today's international rugby players are so well prepared physically, they could run through brick walls. Unfortunately, most of them would do so without remembering there's a ball under their arm. A handful of key players with superior rugby IQ are going to decide this World Cup. They are, alas, a mere handful.</p><p>Divisions between rich and poor are widening</p><p>A rising tide lifts all boats, but human history shows that it lifts some boats faster than others. The spread of professionalism is improving the rugby capabilities of the second- and third-tier nations, but it is improving those of the top-tier at a faster rate. Every World Cup, we hear the same baloney about the gap narrowing. It's not. Japan beating Ireland is the only rankings-upset so far. Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are further behind than they ever have been. Italy? Until 2013, Italy were beating top-tier nations once or twice a year. Since 2013, Italy have recorded just two wins over the top tier. Standards for the poor countries are improving, but each year the rich are advancing further ahead of them.</p><p>Lawyers paralyse progress</p><p>The policing of 'dangerous' play, where 'danger' is defined not by commonsense or observation but by a set of body parts (shoulder connects with head, elbow connects with neck), is well-intentioned, but misguided. Referees' hands are tied, except to dole out yellow cards with a shrug and \"I have no choice, this is the framework\". What they are obeying is a legal framework born from the concept of duty of care and the fear of future litigation. The legal tail is wagging the rugby dog and having the same impact as legal tails everywhere.</p><p>We are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good</p><p>Forget the NRL grand final. If you want to see a refereeing fiasco, tune in to any RWC match. Sometimes you might think you are watching televised bureaucracy, with officials convening committees to micro-manage every occurrence in slow-motion replay and reduce a game to a series of decision-making 'protocols'. We are fast approaching two-hour games, where video and on-field officials put themselves on centre stage in their Quixotic pursuit of perfection, as if that was what we had come to see. Rugby is stuck in technology's thrall. There is no perfect game where referees get everything right and have limitless time to make sure they do so. That idea of perfection, which exists only in the imaginations of law-enforcement officials, is what is known elsewhere as a failed totalitarian state.</p><p>Australians aren't as good as we think we are</p><p>It's a long time since the irony Donald Horne intended in his 'Lucky Country' was lost. With our exceptional history in the Rugby World Cup, Australians have grown to expect the Wallabies to overachieve. Maybe it's our isolation. We think we're a little bit special, a bit lucky. We murmur that we're in this with a big chance. Don't think so.</p><p>Religion is the opium of the people</p><p>Japan is great - packed stadia, happy crowds of locals and tourists, everyone enjoying the global festival of rugby. People are on such a high at being part of the event that they don't even notice when 40 per cent of their 'entertainment' comprises attempts to pack and re-pack scrums. When Australia played Wales, with seven minutes to go the game hung in the balance. The next three-and-a-half minutes were lost while a single scrum was (not) being packed. Did anyone notice? No, they were having too good a time. Rugby is their religion. What Karl Marx said was true in 1844 and it's even truer now, it's just that we have more religions to sedate us.</p><p>Climate will have the final say</p><p>First it was the humidity causing errors, all those northern hemisphere players with sweaty palms like overdressed tropical tour groups. Now it's Typhoon Hagibis wiping out games with unpredictable consequences. It doesn't matter what causes its moods, you don't want to get on the wrong side of mother nature, the ultimate decision-maker.</p>", "publisher": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "instances": ["Did anyone notice?

Despite their doll-like demeanour, they are powerful comments on the interaction between humans and the the natural and spiritual world, concepts that are closely entwined in Japan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When I draw, I always feel as though I am a little girl myself. Just as when I was little, I still cannot draw a boy or a man. I was quite a cheerful child but my personality gradually changed and I became afraid of talking to people. This is because I believed I was different from other people,\" the artist says, through an interpreter, often pausing before she answers a question for a lengthy and thoughtful \"hmmm\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I wanted to be alone in the mountains or in a quiet place. This darker side appeared in my artwork.\"</p><p>We are days from the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, and a three-hour bullet train ride away from Tokyo, as Chiho, who is rarely interviewed, describes how much of her work, most notably the 2015 show Rebirth of the World shown in Seattle and Tokyo, has been an artistic expression of Japan's vulnerability to weather events.</p><p>\"I became very scared. Living in Japan, we face natural disasters which we cannot stop because the country sits on many active faults that frequently cause major earthquakes. We have to live with them. I created a character called Maguma-chan, who is a natural spirit, thinking about the natural disasters, particularly the tsunami, from the nature's point of view. The character is simply there, but she inevitably causes earthquakes from time to time, and it can't be helped.\"</p><p>One of the stars of the Art Gallery of New South Wales' upcoming Japan Supernatural exhibition, Chiho arrives for our interview in a Kyoto hotel bearing gifts of beautifully wrapped sweets. She casts a tall chic figure with her two-tone designer sandals, ostrich-feather trimmed black top and on-trend jeans. It is obvious, before she admits it, that some of her \"little girls\" are avatars.</p><p>During the show, another character Moimoi will flutter from promotional flagpoles around the city. Chiho's self-perceived \"strangeness\", which once made her feel an outsider, has created a palpable connection around the world, particularly with women and on Instagram. \"I started creating Moimoi when I was walking in a graveyard every day. Moimoi is an avatar of myself who is playing around in nature.\"</p><p>As a child, Chiho believed she was \"different and strange\". While she made conventional drawings in the sight of her teachers and family; privately she filled secret notebooks with intimate, unusual and even erotic imaginings that she would toss away on completion. \"At the end of elementary school my parents found out and I was very embarrassed. They didn't mind, but I thought I was different from other children. I wanted to be the same as other people. I wanted to be ordinary.\"</p><p>Ashamed of the discovery, she stopped drawing through high school and then chose the most ordinary of university courses, economics. \"It didn't make any sense but, looking back, I always tried to be normal. But university was so boring and I realised it would be impossible for me to work in a bank or for a company.\"</p><p>A part-time role as an assistant in an advertising agency opened her eyes. \"I was very surprised that young people my age were doing designing and were responsible for their work. They were very different from the people I used to meet. It made me feel that I am not so strange; there are people who are stranger than me. I became confident that I could express myself.\"</p><p>The funky young colleagues taught Chiho how to draw on an Apple Macintosh computer and she began to create her own work after hours. When renowned artist Takashi Murakami (see page 8) came to the agency to work on an advertisement for the US release of the movie Ghosts in the Shell, she showed him some printouts of her work, not realising how famous he was.</p><p>\"He thought my work was interesting and encouraged me. It was the first time my drawing was approved.\" One year later, in 1999, Murakami invited her to take part in a group show of new artists, Tokyo Girls Bravo, which was then shown in New York in 2004, and she subsequently joined his extensive production design team at the Kaikai Kiki studio, in a converted suburban factory, until \"it became too difficult to work as a designer and an artist so I quit the company\".</p><p>She continues to be categorised as part of Murakami's Superflat movement, a post-modern art movement influenced by traditional non-three-dimensional forms of Japanese art as well as the contemporary images of manga and anime.</p><p>Although rarely mentioned but not a secret, Aoshima and Murakami are now married and have two children, son Shin no Suke, 9, and daughter Natsuko, 6, who are coming with them to the Sydney opening, eager to see koalas and fruit bats. The reason for their privacy and the rejection of the status of celebrity art couple is clearly well considered and, arguably, it is a strategy that has allowed Aoshima's work to gain recognition in its own right.</p><p>Having met Murakami two days earlier, it would be fair to describe the couple as chalk and cheese; he a workaholic extrovert known for sleeping in a large cardboard box at his studio, she a thoughtful introvert who revels in solitude and has deliberately lived near two graveyards in Tokyo.</p><p>\"I wasn't uncomfortable living there.I felt as though in the graveyard nature flourished, cuddling against the sadness of us humnas unable to defy our death. \" she said. \"I found something I really wanted there. It felt very calming and comfortable.\"</p><p>In a video produced by Dark Motion Graphics for her exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum in 2015, Aoshima says: \"I imagine when you die, the pain and dying would disappear as if you are in a dream. I want to keep reminding myself that inside my body is a skeleton and we all eventually die. Or that I could die tomorrow. I really don't want to forget this feeling.\"</p><p>Initially, Aoshima created her work in Adobe Illustrator, her pieces printed out as ink-jet or chromogenic prints or as wallpapers that have covered walls and ceilings of exhibition space. By 2006, she was incorporating, after much practice, freehand drawing. During a residency in San Antonio, Texas, she digitally printed a 12-metre-long wall work on traditional Japanese paper, collaged the sheets on a wall and then added detail in watercolour and coloured pencil.</p><p>Moimoi subsequently appeared in hundreds of drawings on Japanese rice paper, in dream-like landscapes, alongside cities consumed by waves and flames. The catalogue for the Seattle exhibition commented: \"The drawings, like her murals before, depict utopian visions of a world where mountains and buildings come to life and exist harmoniously with fairy-like creatures.\"</p><p>Talking about her work to me, Aoshima says: \"I am not good at describing my work. I believe people can understand me through my artwork. Most of my works express the spirit in nature. Even the buildings have a spirit. The buildings represent human beings. I like to describe the relationship between humans and nature. I imagine that we can connect with nature. Usually I get inspiration from nature. When I think about nature, it has a soul or a spirit so it connects to the Yokai tradition too.\"</p><p>Aoshima has said that in exploring natural disasters, such as earthquakes and typhoons, she initially sought to show the smallness of human existence and how \"in the great power of nature that we have no chance against nature\". But her perspective changed when she was \"greatly moved by the robust power of recovery\" in the four years after the great earthquake and tsunami disasters of 2011. \"Everyone was shocked and beaten but both people and nature steadily recovered.\" Her work pivoted to explore the regeneration that can follow destruction.</p><p>Xiojin Wu, curator of Japanese and Korean art at the Seattle Art Museum, says: \"When I first saw Chiho's work, I was so drawn into the fantastic world she created and so impressed by her incredible imagination. But it's not just the imagination - she really thinks that world exists.\"</p><p>Melanie Eastburn, senior curator of Asian art at the AGNSW says: \"Chiho Aoshima's work has an intimacy about it that I find compelling and endearing. The characters, some of which are objects that are usually inanimate such as buildings, have distinct personalities. I believe audiences will be spellbound by the spirit-filled fairytale world she has created.\"</p><p>Murakami has written that Aoshima's work \"fits into a feminine, spiritual world that is an area of calm air amidst the context-ridden testosterone-filled worldview of contemporary art\". When a tsunami hit Indonesia shortly after an exhibition of her 2004 work, Magma Spirit Explodes: Tsunami is Dreadful, some pointed to her \"witch-like\" prescience.</p><p>In her video works, Aoshima has collaborated with New Zealand animator Bruce Ferguson, notably on City Glow (2005), which has been shown at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, and Rebirth of the World (2015). In the fashion world, she worked with Murakami on the iconic multi-colour pastel logo pattern for Louis Vuitton and her piece The Red-eyed Tribe (2000) initially an invitation to an Issey Miyake fashion show, was later blown up to 4.5 metres by 16 metres for Superflat at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2001.</p><p>In Sydney's Japan Supernatural exhibition, 24 of Aoshima's watercolours, some with pencil additions, will feature in a dense grouping accompanied by an interactive digital work, Little Miss Gravestone's Absent Musing, a triptych that mirrors a traditional block print format. This work has previously been seen in the Rebirth Of the World at the Seattle Art Museum and Murakami's Kaikai Kiki gallery in Tokyo. Works by one of her inspirations, the acclaimed 19th century artist Katsushika Hokusai, are shown in the same room. French symbolist painter Odilon Redon (1849-1916) is another artistic influence.</p><p>Her latest artistic adventures are in pottery - although, like many parents, she now finds she does not have enough time for her art. Experimenting in a new medium is very enjoyable \"but it has not changed what I want to express that is, the theme of people and nature.\"</p><p>Chiho Aoshima is part of the Sydney International Art Series exhibition Japan Supernatural at the Art Gallery of NSW from November 2-March 8.
