The Mayo Clinic has been ranked as one of the best hospitals in the US, since 1990, and the best hospital in the world for the past seven years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2015, Mayo launched the Destination Medical Centre (DMC) campaign to make Rochester a global medical destination. The plan included new biotechnology incubator precincts, regeneration of housing near healthcare facilities, and improved transportation networks from airports and regional communities. Rochester's success provides a model that Tasmania could follow for specialised medicine and economic development.</p><p>In 2025, Mayo employs 33,000 people in Rochester and generates $US1.5bn ($2.3bn) annual tax revenue. The larger Mayo Clinic health system has patients from more than 130 countries each year. Visitors provide a boost to the local economy each time they visit and pay out-of-pocket for the healthcare, rather than draining Medicare.</p><p>In addition to The Mayo Clinic, I have also worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which was the No. 1 ranked hospital in the US from 1991 to 2011. The striking difference was that Johns Hopkins was in the centre of a large industrial city, whereas Rochester was nestled into a midwestern farm community setting. This contrast shows that great healthcare can be delivered in very different socio-economic settings.</p><p>We have great people working in the Tasmanian health system, but resources are lacking in many key areas. The relatively new K Block building at the Royal Hobart Hospital was a great step forward.</p><p>When my youngest son was born, the K Block was basically a hole in the ground we could see out the window of the hospital. I watched the K Block rise and supply many design and construction jobs before diversifying into the hundreds of jobs needed to operate and maintain the new building. This made me wonder: Could Tasmania become a global medical destination?</p><p>Tasmania doesn't have a globally high-ranking hospital like The Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins as a foundation for a DMC. However, Tasmania is a unique and wonderful place to live and raise a family.</p><p>The true wilderness at our urban doorsteps in Tasmania is an experience to behold, and promotes outdoor lifestyles with great wellbeing benefits.</p><p>This wild beauty could be at the heart of a similar campaign here which could be titled Destination Medical Tasmania (DMT). Integrating what is special about Tasmania with current healthcare, research, and industry specialisations could make DMT a reality.</p><p>Specialisations are the key to developing a DMT; we can't be the best at everything, but we can be the best in some things and good in many others.</p><p>The University of Tasmania (UTAS) has world class neuroscience research and teaching programs. For example, UTAS has developed several massive online open courses (MOOCs) for dementia, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson's, and traumatic brain injury that have enrolled more than 500,000 participants from around the world since 2013.</p><p>Dementia was the second leading cause of death in Australia in 2023, and is one of the most challenging diseases for patients' families. Likewise, Tasmania has one of the highest multiple sclerosis rates in the world. A key aspect of specialty care for these debilitating neurological diseases would be teaching people how to care for their family members and themselves in the early stages of these debilitating diseases.</p><p>What better place to do this than Tasmania, with a view of kunanyi/Mt Wellington during the day and the gentle sounds of pademelons hopping around at night?</p><p>Nature-based solutions that not only extend lives, but also improve the quality of life for patients and families is an emerging field.</p><p>Programs like the dementia-inclusive nature hubs can help to address the growing need for dementia care and training. While dementia is one of the leading causes of death, mental health issues are among the most rapidly expanding quality of life issues on a global scale.</p><p>Nature based-solutions will play a key role in addressing mental health issues. Tasmania is an ideal setting to attract global patients and families to a DMT specialisation in nature-based solutions, which can fuel small businesses like \"Nature. Be in it\".</p><p>Additional specialisations could include One Health training centres, which focus on the links between human, animal, and environmental health, and trauma medicine to address the growing global popularity of Tasmania as a mountain biking and wilderness adventure destination.</p><p>As we are considering how to invest in the future of Tasmania, shouldn't we be considering what our most pressing needs are now and what they will be in the future?

First, oyster mushrooms are grown on maize stover, producing protein-rich food using a widely available and low-cost substrate. The spent mushroom material then feeds earthworms, which convert it into additional high-quality protein and nutrient-rich compost. Farmed earthworms were found to have a protein content and amino acid profile comparable to or better than commonly farmed insects, making them a promising alternative protein source. At the same time, the compost they produce helps maintain soil carbon content-without the need for extra land. This circular system could strengthen local food security and support soil health in maize-based farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the face of population growth, land scarcity, and climate-related stress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 20: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Light, Roots, and Nutrients: Understanding Nitrate Uptake Regulation in Hydroponic Systems</p><p>My PhD research explored nitrate uptake regulation in hydroponics-a system where plants grow in nutrient-rich water without soil, offering sustainable production potential. Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning. I developed a dynamic model that estimates how long a setup can sustain plant growth, and whether issues like rising EC, nutrient depletion, or imbalanced nutrient ratios may occur under different environmental conditions, system sizes, and replenishment strategies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>July 04: Wageningen University &amp; Research: NWA funding for research into quinoa, lupin and aardaker: promising meat alternatives that also benefit the soil</p><p>A plate of vegetables that not only nourishes people but also helps restore biodiversity, improve soil health and make our diets more climate-friendly.

First, oyster mushrooms are grown on maize stover, producing protein-rich food using a widely available and low-cost substrate. The spent mushroom material then feeds earthworms, which convert it into additional high-quality protein and nutrient-rich compost. Farmed earthworms were found to have a protein content and amino acid profile comparable to or better than commonly farmed insects, making them a promising alternative protein source. At the same time, the compost they produce helps maintain soil carbon content-without the need for extra land. This circular system could strengthen local food security and support soil health in maize-based farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the face of population growth, land scarcity, and climate-related stress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 20: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Light, Roots, and Nutrients: Understanding Nitrate Uptake Regulation in Hydroponic Systems</p><p>My PhD research explored nitrate uptake regulation in hydroponics-a system where plants grow in nutrient-rich water without soil, offering sustainable production potential. Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning. I developed a dynamic model that estimates how long a setup can sustain plant growth, and whether issues like rising EC, nutrient depletion, or imbalanced nutrient ratios may occur under different environmental conditions, system sizes, and replenishment strategies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>July 04: Wageningen University &amp; Research: NWA funding for research into quinoa, lupin and aardaker: promising meat alternatives that also benefit the soil</p><p>A plate of vegetables that not only nourishes people but also helps restore biodiversity, improve soil health and make our diets more climate-friendly.

When the earthquake modified the elevation of land in areas like Anchorage and the Copper River Delta, it resulted in a complex new coastal wetland landscape. Since then, salt marshes have reestablished themselves, creating vital habitats for species such as shorebirds, salmon, beaver, and moose.

First, oyster mushrooms are grown on maize stover, producing protein-rich food using a widely available and low-cost substrate. The spent mushroom material then feeds earthworms, which convert it into additional high-quality protein and nutrient-rich compost. Farmed earthworms were found to have a protein content and amino acid profile comparable to or better than commonly farmed insects, making them a promising alternative protein source. At the same time, the compost they produce helps maintain soil carbon content-without the need for extra land.

Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning.

Published by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Forest Trends, the new report Doubling Down on Nature: State of Investment in Nature-based Solutions for Water Security, 2025 underlines growing confidence in the power of these approaches among investors and policymakers. While the sector is dominated by government funding (97%), the findings highlight the accelerating rate at which private finance is rising while also showing how even major economic slowdowns like the COVID pandemic failed to dampen this growing interest.

These bills establish the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program, a statewide initiative that enables groundwater rights holders, including agricultural producers, to voluntarily retire groundwater rights in areas where water use exceeds long-term water availability. They also create the Account for Retiring Water Rights, a dedicated fund within the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, that will be used to purchase and retire groundwater rights. Once retired, these rights are permanently removed from use, helping stabilize aquifers and protect natural ecosystems.", "While the sector is dominated by government funding (97%), the findings highlight the accelerating rate at which private finance is rising while also showing how even major economic slowdowns like the COVID pandemic failed to dampen this growing interest.

Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning. I developed a dynamic model that estimates how long a setup can sustain plant growth, and whether issues like rising EC, nutrient depletion, or imbalanced nutrient ratios may occur under different environmental conditions, system sizes, and replenishment strategies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 20: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Earthworm Farming for Circular Food Systems: Upcycling Residual Biomass into Edible Protein and Organic Soil Amendments</p><p>This PhD research explores how agricultural waste, such as leftover maize stalks, can be transformed into valuable food and natural fertilizer through a combination of mushroom cultivation and earthworm farming. First, oyster mushrooms are grown on maize stover, producing protein-rich food using a widely available and low-cost substrate. The spent mushroom material then feeds earthworms, which convert it into additional high-quality protein and nutrient-rich compost. Farmed earthworms were found to have a protein content and amino acid profile comparable to or better than commonly farmed insects, making them a promising alternative protein source. At the same time, the compost they produce helps maintain soil carbon content-without the need for extra land. This circular system could strengthen local food security and support soil health in maize-based farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the face of population growth, land scarcity, and climate-related stress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 18: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Smell it, select it!

Four studies were conducted in both controlled lab environments and real-life contexts, using questionnaires, food choice tasks, cognitive tasks, eye-tracking, and brain scans (MRI). The result showed that food odors can promote the selection of healthy-congruent foods, though the effect was modest and context-dependent. Moreover, olfactory cues influence early decision stages, such as attention, and may engage distinct brain regions related to cognitive control and reward processing. These insights may inform the development of low-cost, non-intrusive strategies that employ olfactory cues to support healthier eating and contribute to public health improvement.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 05: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Mirte Bosse awarded international prize for DNA research and wildlife conservation</p><p>Today, the National Geographic Society announced that Mirte Bosse, biologist and geneticist at Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), is among the winners of the 2025 Wayfinder Award.

Vitamin D - often called \"the sunshine vitamin\" - is an essential nutrient for good health. Your body produces it when your skin is exposed to UVB rays from sunlight. Despite its natural source, many people don't get enough, which can lead to a deficiency that affects bones, muscles, mood and more.</p><p>Vitamin D plays several critical roles. It helps your body absorb calcium and maintain phosphorus levels. Both are vital for keeping your bones strong and healthy.</p><p>This important vitamin also supports your immune system and is linked to a lower risk of chronic conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.

Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

Instead, the viewer plays an essential role.</p><p>To examine what makes art memorable, researchers asked art viewers to reflect on experiences with art and describe aloud what the art they remembered looked like, where they were when they saw it, how they felt, and what else they thought about. From the responses, the team gleaned that memorable art experiences are marked by intense concentration, awareness of a variety of bodily sensations, and people making connections to personal experiences or events from their lives.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 4 YALE UNIVERSITY: DEMOGRAPHY</p><p>4.1 Employees Demography</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"392\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gender</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Percentage</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Men</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">52</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Women</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["In the global effort to decarbonize, the conversation is often dominated by high-tech solutions like electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and smart grids.

The research confirms that reintroducing this keystone species actively transforms the landscape into a more effective carbon sink, demonstrating that nature-based solutions can be a critical complement to our technological efforts. The Surprising Science of a 'Mosaic' LandscapeThe study, led by Professor Oswald Schmitz of the Yale School of the Environment, centers on the concept of \"trophic rewilding. The key is not just the presence of bison, but their behavior. By grazing heavily, they create a dynamic and varied \"mosaic landscape\"-a patchwork of grasslands, scrub, and forests-rather than allowing a uniform, dense forest to dominate.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors.

From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value.

Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

This provides solid evidence that old age leads to gradual withdrawal from tool use, and is a contributing factor to lower efficiency in chimps' stone tool selection and use.</p><p>The findings also indicate that chimpanzees mirror human beings in how the aging process affects their ability to carry out dextrous and cognitively-challenging daily tasks. Similar to humans, the effects of old-age varied considerably between individuals, with some chimpanzees struggling to use tools, whilst others maintained excellent performance into later life.</p><p>Wild chimpanzees use tools during some of the most cognitively and physically demanding foraging behaviours observed in non-human animals. While the behavioural changes that occur with aging have been widely studied in humans and some captive primates, exceptionally little is known about how growing older affects the lives of elderly wild apes. This includes how the capacity to address technical, real-world tasks changes as chimpanzees become progressively older.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["Haverkort from the Institute for Theoretical Physics.

It's a beautiful part of the world, but reconciling that beauty with what is happening on the ground is getting harder by the week. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lake Macquarie City Council (LMCC) continues to actively pursue population growth ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8971556/lake-macquarie-council-criticised-for-90k-spend-on-sydney-promo/\"> Lake Mac woos Sydney millennials with $90,000 coffee and VR </url>', <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NH</emphasis> 21/5) and heralds every growth milestone as a triumph, as if it's business as usual, while the climate crisis escalates.</p><p>In the past six months alone, Lake Macquarie has been declared a natural disaster area twice, first in January and again in May. Torrential rain, violent storms, and widespread flooding inundated homes, severed roads and racked up millions in damage. These are not \"once-in-a-generation\" events. They are the new normal, warning signs: loud, frequent, and increasingly devastating.</p><p>Last week, LMCC unveiled its draft <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Teralba to Toronto (T2T) Climate Resilience Plan</emphasis>, which paints a sobering picture of what residents in the city's west can expect as climate impacts intensify. The projections are stark: severe fire weather days up 45 per cent by 2030 and 130 per cent by 2090 (relative to 1995); extreme rainfall events up 10 per cent by 2030 and almost 20 per cent by 2050; lake level rise of 40cm by 2050, enough to inundate 251 homes and threaten another 565.</p><p>These statistics aren't future hypotheticals. They describe what my neighbours, colleagues, and family are already experiencing: more frequent storms, longer recovery times, and a creeping sense of insecurity about the place we call home. But instead of treating this as a wake-up call, some councillors fret about its tone ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8988842/lake-macquarie-climate-plan-will-cost-residents-warns-pauling/\"> More difficult': Councillor issues warning on climate plan's impact </url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NH</emphasis> 10/6).

What good is a resilience plan if the council continues to push for and approve developments in high-risk floodplains and heat-affected suburbs, clearing the bushland that naturally soaks up water, cools streets and stores carbon? </p><p>Rather than drafting PDFs with scant follow-through, why not prioritise proven nature-based solutions and stop chasing short-term economic wins?</p><p>\"Resilience\" has become a buzzword, too often used to applaud communities for bouncing back instead of preventing harm in the first place.

No. But it is an honest assessment of what lies ahead if we stay on the current course. </p><p>Climate change is not a distant threat; it is here, accelerating and reshaping our lives.</p><p>The pressing question is whether the council's strategies are being matched with tangible action on the ground. Residents are urged to \"prepare your home, have a plan, be more resilient\", but there is only so much a household can do. Personal preparedness matters, yet it cannot offset the consequences of systemic planning decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the economic costs of inaction are mounting. </p><p>Disaster recovery, road repairs, rising insurance premiums and health impacts already strain household and government budgets. Continuing to prioritise short-term development gains over long-term sustainability only amplifies those bills. Rethinking spending priorities is not merely a climate imperative; it is sound financial governance.</p><p>We cannot grow our way out of this crisis. It is time Lake Macquarie City Council aligned its budgets with climate reality, rethought its spending priorities and matched its bold words with bold action before the next \"once-in-a-generation\" disaster arrives, right on schedule.</p><p>Anna Noon is a Lake Macquarie resident with a background in social and environmental justice.</p>", "publisher": "Newcastle Herald", "instances": ["Facing reality isn't the problem; inaction is.

Yet it underpins virtually every aspect of daily life-from food and healthcare, to communication and transport. Globally, it enables sustainable development by improving educational outcomes, increasing clean water availability, and building climate adaptation capacity. Its centrality in the UN Sustainable Development Goals underscores a shared understanding: equitable development hinges on universal energy access.</p><p>Achieving this goal, however, is far from straightforward. Though policy-making and planning tends to focus on national-scale grid extension, this is not a panacea. The estimated 750 million people who remain without electricity access globally are predominantly located in rural, remote areas, where traditional grid expansion is neither technically nor financially viable. Even where grids are present, households may lack the means or motivation to connect, or the appliances to make use of their connection.
