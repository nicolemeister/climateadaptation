But the CLP seems to be leading the NT in the opposite direction, based on its budget and new policy positions. The 2025 federal election followed the second hottest summer on record in Australia. Communities across the Territory have felt these impacts more than most, with the latest monsoon onset ever recorded in the Top End, through to the hottest summer on record for Alice Springs, with an average maximum temperature of 39.6C in the 100 days between December 1, 2024 and March 10, 2025. These severe and increasingly more dangerous climate change impacts are further driving high levels of social inequity across our communities, with extreme weather and disaster events already impacting the economy, health and wellbeing. </p><p>Recent research shows that 50-75 per cent of Aboriginal households in remote areas of the Territory live below the poverty line, leaving the communities in these areas highly susceptible to harm from these climate change impacts, while under-resourced and with little ability to influence change. Standing in the way of progress though is the continued approvals of new fossil fuel projects. Deep and sustained cuts to emissions are essential to limiting the severity of future climate impacts. Limits to adaptation are already being reached, and some communities face fundamental limits to adaptation. There is an urgent need for drastic emissions reductions to prevent the most extreme and irreversible consequences of climate change - expanding fossil fuel extraction flies in the face of that. The NT's CLP government promised the electorate that they would uphold their party's commitment to net zero by 2050 should they win the 2024 election. Less than 12 months later, the party has abandoned its own 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 target, and now as of mid-June, their net-zero goals have also been officially removed from the CLP platform as well. Given that one of the first things the CLP government did was to remove the Department of Climate Change entirely, this now-broken promise to constituents never seemed to be taken seriously. It is therefore even more imperative that with the re-election of the federal Labor government, election promises are upheld. In particular, the commitment to lower the prices of 30 household goods across NT remote communities to ensure that pricing is consistent with what those living in the cities pay is a critically important and long overdue policy that addresses food security, health, poverty alleviation and climate justice. Aboriginal people living in communities and homelands often have to pay at least double the cost for essential items. This injustice is further exacerbated by extreme weather-related disaster events, which are common across the Territory, and bring significant impacts to food security. The high costs associated with food supply chains in remote areas, coupled with overburdened, expensive, and ageing energy infrastructure, frequently result in food unavailability and spoilage due to power outages. The high costs of sourcing food, and replacing spoilt food, add yet another layer of disadvantage. Strong federal leadership in this space can make a significant difference to the everyday lives of communities and families. We also welcome ongoing investment in renewable energy. The Albanese government's commitment to 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, and a 30 per cent reduction to the cost of solar batteries, align with the increasing demand for solar power even as renewable targets are wound back. The Territory has the highest average levels of solar irradiance on Earth - we live where the sun's rays are most extreme - and both rooftop and stand-alone solar systems offer cheaper, clean, reliable energy. Increasing investment in community-owned solar across the Northern Territory, spearheaded by organisations such as Original Power, is also helping to foster self-determination. Most of Jesuit Social Services' work in the Northern Territory is centred on climate, young people, and communities. Communities and families, and young people in particular, are increasingly concerned about the impact of climate change. Place-based approaches allows us to work from the ground up, fostering self-determination, in order to help build thriving and resilient communities. Given the impacts of climate change that are being experienced, we will continue to call for a commitment from all parties to increase investment in disaster resilience, with a dedicated funding stream to strengthen disaster resilience in vulnerable communities, including those communities disproportionately impacted by extreme heat.</p><p>Jesuit Social Services are hopeful that targeted government policy will help to alleviate some of the extreme impacts of climate change facing communities across the Territory, and we will continue to work alongside communities from the ground up to foster change.

The ion trap uses electric and magnetic fields to trap an ion and the quantum illumination apparatus uses the trapped ion to produce a signal photon for use in quantum illumination. The signal photon has correlations with an idler field stored with use of the trapped ion, as a phonon of the trapped ion. A signal photon transmission line extends between the ion trap and an antenna. The signal photon may be scattered, e.g., reflected or refracted, by a target object back to the antenna, and the transmission line transmits the signal photon back to the ion trap. The ion trap generates an electrical signal based on correlations between the signal photon and the idler field.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Training that goes beyond traditional law enforcement is becoming essential. Research shows crisis intervention programs improve officer confidence, reduce use of force, and lead to better diversion into treatment.</p><p>In response, Eastern Michigan University and the Ann Arbor Police Department (AAPD) have developed a first-of-its-kind interactive training program that blends theater and law enforcement to improve officers' responses to mental health crises.</p><p>EMU social work professor Barbara Walters and AAPD community engagement officer Kasey Whitford laid the groundwork for AAPD's new interactive crisis prevention training. \"I thought it would be cool to use theatre students instead of other officers, because with trained actors, the scenarios feel more real,\" said Whitford.</p><p>The training included simulated encounters, such as responding to individuals in psychiatric distress or experiencing behavioral health crises. Officers participated in these roleplays in real-time, practicing de-escalation strategies, communication techniques, and trauma-informed responses.</p><p>August 12: Eastern Michigan University: Eastern Michigan University named among nations best colleges for 2026 by The Princeton Review</p><p>Eastern Michigan University has again earned national recognition from The Princeton Review, securing a place among the country's top 391 undergraduate institutions in its Best Colleges: 2026 Edition.</p><p>This distinction places EMU in the top 15% of nearly 2,400 four-year colleges nationwide.

As she prepares to compete for the Miss.America title in September, Palmer remains rooted in service, using her platform to promote early mental health awareness among children through her nonprofit, The Sunflower Project.</p><p>Palmer, who earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education from EMU, is a passionate advocate for mental health. As a suicide attempt and loss survivor, she channels her experiences into empowering others to talk openly about their emotions, especially at a young age.</p><p>\"I lost a close childhood friend to suicide in 2018,\" said Palmer. \"We had similar struggles, but we never talked about them. That loss inspired me to encourage kids to have those conversations earlier and to understand that it's okay to ask for help.\"</p><p>Founded in 2021, The Sunflower Project has distributed $6K in social and emotional learning resources to students and families across Michigan. The organization partners with schools and national initiatives, such as MTV's Mental Health Action Day, to shift the narrative around mental health.</p><p>\"When people think about anxiety or suicide prevention, they often associate those topics with darkness,\" said Palmer.</p><p>July 24: First cohort from Eastern Michigan University's College in Prison program to graduate July 30</p><p>Eastern Michigan University will celebrate a groundbreaking milestone: the graduation of the first cohort from its College in Prison program at the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility-the only women's prison in Michigan.

And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world.

Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place.

It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay.

The 2017 Eastern Michigan University graduate has leveraged her business education to create a platform that empowers Detroiters through credit literacy, entrepreneurship, and economic access.</p><p>As a business administration major, Cochran came to EMU as a business owner determined to sharpen her skills and broaden her impact. \"My time at EMU solidified the path I chose,\" said Cochran. \"Classes like marketing with Professor Harry Derderian taught me how to truly connect with my audience, something I hadn't mastered before.

After selling her tax preparation business to H&amp;R Block in 2013, Cochran realized many of her clients were denied refund loans due to low credit scores, a problem rooted in a lack of financial literacy.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay.

And they are laying the foundation for more inclusive and resilient democracies.\"</p><p>In a full auditorium before leaders, policymakers, and civil society leaders dedicated to advancing human rights, Nowrojee commended the endurance and resilient spirit of the Latin American people, a region that went through colonization and won liberation and, over the years, has seen the evolution of different courageous social movements rising in the most difficult times.</p><p>She also spoke of events globally, with the rise of authoritarianism, historic levels of inequality, the proliferation of conflict, and the risks to the international order.</p><p>\"The liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity. These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong,\" asserted Nowrojee.</p><p>The Open Society Foundations work in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, centering the communities that have long been marginalized and excluded but bear the great consequences of systemic crises. In many of these contexts, it's women and youth as the drivers of change.</p><p>\"They are bringing down the oppressive and discriminatory structures that have held them back. And they are reimagining their societies and pursuing their aspirations for a more just and equitable world. The world has gone wrong in many ways, but there are also people making it right,\" said Nowrojee.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT IN A WORLD GONE WRONG</p><p>Dear friends, esteemed guests,</p><p>Buenas noches.</p><p>It is a great honor to be back in Mexico City, among all of you-to see familiar faces and new ones, and to be here in this beautiful museum, a space that holds the memory, resilience, and richness of the many cultures that have shaped this country and continue to inspire the world.</p><p>We meet at a time of profound global turbulence. Wars are intensifying, proliferating, and growing longer.</p><p>Every day, we see horrifying scenes of unconscionable human suffering-people killed as they queue for food, children dying from starvation, churches and mosques bombed, hospitals destroyed, and entire cities laid to ruin.</p><p>At the same time, our planet is being pushed past its limits. The ravages of climate change are producing droughts, famines, displacement, and conflicts.</p><p>Powerful countries are now actively rolling back their commitments, accelerating deforestation and emissions. Meanwhile, the countries least responsible for this emergency are suffering the most.</p><p>These environmental catastrophes are not isolated. They flow from a deeper crisis of inequality-within countries and between them.</p><p>The same system that allows a tiny elite to accumulate unimaginable wealth also fuels environmental destruction-including Latin America's precious ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Mesoamerican forests-as corporations prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of the planet.</p><p>Even in places where people's future once felt secure, we see democracies devouring themselves. Elections have become tools for autocrats- mechanisms not to uphold freedom, but to consolidate power, seize institutions, and bend them to their will.</p><p>And the liberal international order, which was designed to hold our world together, is fracturing-risking the breakdown not only of global cooperation but the very idea of our shared humanity.</p><p>These are not separate and distinct crises. They are interlocking, systemic failures that have created a world gone wrong.</p><p>The question for us is: How do we stand for what's right in a world gone wrong?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FALSE, RECKLESS, AND DANGEROUS CLAIMS AGAINST OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS STAFF ON DURHAM REPORT</p><p>NEW YORK-The declassification and release of the annex to Special Counsel John Durham's report on intelligence activities and investigations related to the 2016 presidential election is being weaponized to attack the Open Society Foundations and its staff.</p><p>The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false. They are grounded in malicious disinformation that has been traced to Russian intelligence and is now being used in a politically motivated campaign.</p><p>The Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff.

Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay.

Featuring over fifty works across ceramics, film, photography, and archives, the exhibition draws connections between the legacy of renowned Nigerian potter Ladi Dosei Kwali (1925-1984) and contemporary artistic practice. Through these lines of influence and innovation, the show traces how Black women artists have transformed the field of ceramics over the past seventy years-disrupting conventions, challenging hierarchies, and expanding the possibilities of clay as a medium.</p><p>Following critical acclaim at Two Temple Place in London and York Art Gallery in 2022, this landmark exhibition makes its U.S. debut on the centenary of Kwali's birth, honoring her powerful work's deep and broad influence over time and place. Curated by Dr. Jareh Das, this iteration of the exhibition features new works and includes three U.S.-based artists: Adebunmi Gbadebo, Simone Leigh, and Anina Major. It challenges dominant narratives in ceramics history by celebrating matrilineal, Indigenous African pottery techniques and clay's enduring presence as both an artistic and functional form of expression. Dr. Das's revelatory curation will immerse visitors in a contemplative space for reflecting on the layered histories of ceramics and the radical potentials of form, gesture, and the material memory of clay. The transformative qualities of the featured works become amplified in conversation with each other across generations, redefining and pushing the boundaries of ceramics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   FORD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES HEATHER GERKEN AS NEW PRESIDENT</p><p>Today, Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, chair of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, announced that Heather Gerken will become the 11th president of the Ford Foundation in November of 2025, succeeding Darren Walker.
