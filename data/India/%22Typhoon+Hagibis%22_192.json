In a first, the organising committee of the 2026 Asiad, to be held in Japan, have created a 'floating' Athletes' Village after it was decided that nearly one-third of the total 15,000 athletes and officials will be housed on a luxury cruise ship that will be docked at the Nagoya Port. The host city, the capital of Aichi prefecture, has a population of 2.3 million. The organisers said they decided against constructing a Games-specific infrastructure to cut costs.</p><p>The 'floating village' will have all the usual amenities - from dining halls and gymnasiums to medical services and free internet. But amidst the fun at the Games, the athletes - even as they soak in the unmatched views of the Pacific Ocean - will be briefed on how to cope if the waters turn violent.</p><p>With the 2026 Asian Games scheduled to be held from September 19 to October 4 in Aichi and Nagoya, considered to be the peak typhoon season, the Organising Committee is preparing a 'contingency plan to evacuate athletes in case of tsunami, typhoons or natural disasters', two senior Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) officials told The Indian Express.</p><p>Last month, during a meeting of the Asian Games Coordination Committee in Nagoya, the delegations of 45 participating nations were briefed about the emergency evacuation plans and temporary accommodation, along with a detailed advisory outlining do's and don'ts.</p><p>\"The Japanese authorities are very experienced in dealing with natural disasters, and the OCA has every confidence that they will take adequate measures, especially in informing the athletes of the contingency plans,\" Vinod Tiwari, the Deputy Director General of the OCA, told The Indian Express.</p><p>Tayyab Ikram, the chairman of the Asian Games Coordination Committee, said 'Nagoya is more exposed to these kinds of natural disasters than Tokyo', which hosted the Olympic Games in 2021.</p><p>\"We visited a couple of premises that can be used as shelters. We spent a lot of time discussing evacuation plans and management in case of an unfortunate, natural occurrence,\" Ikram told this daily, adding that the local officials provided them 'full data' on the previous instances.</p><p>According to the Nagoya University Disaster Mitigation Research Centre, 'as a coastal city with many rivers, Nagoya is particularly vulnerable to flooding in the event of a tsunami.' The city is also susceptible to typhoons in the season roughly from May to October, peaking in August and September.</p><p>In 2019, when Japan hosted the Rugby World Cup, three matches were unprecedentedly cancelled owing to Typhoon Hagibis, which killed more than 100 people and caused flooding. Even during the 2021 Olympics, contingency plans were made to evacuate athletes in case of a natural disaster like an earthquake, given the high seismic activity in Japan as the country sits on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'.</p><p>The emergency measures for the Asian Games were further necessitated after it was decided to use cruise ships for accommodation rather than constructing apartments to house athletes.</p><p>Tiwari said 4,600 athletes and officials-roughly one-third of the total 15,000 participants-would stay on a luxury cruise liner docked at the Kinjo Pier in the Port of Nagoya. Another 2,400 athletes and officials will be accommodated at a pier roughly 15 minutes from the cruise ship.</p><p>Tiwari and Ikram hailed the concept of the 'Floating Village' and added that it could be a 'possible guidance for future editions'.</p><p>\"We believe the cruise ship will become the symbol of the 20th Asian Games - a striking focal point and the first luxury 'Floating Village' in the history of the OCA,\" Tiwari said. \"For many athletes, it will be a 'once in a lifetime' experience to stay on a cruise ship - not just the accommodation but the camaraderie of the athletes from different sports and different NOCs (National Olympic Committees). It will be truly a unique and exciting experience.\"</p><p>However, staying at the shore will present unique challenges, especially in the typhoon season. Ikram said that following consultations with the local organisers, it was decided that all 'athletes will be properly briefed and demonstrations will be conducted to educate them.'</p><p>Tiwari added: \"Regarding the cruise ship, in case of a natural disaster such as a typhoon, the cruise ship will evacuate from the Port of Nagoya to the open sea with athletes and team officials. This is according to the Nagoya Port regulations.\"</p><p>\"Regarding the athletes and officials staying in the Asian Games Villas (temporary container homes) at Garden Pier, 6.5km from Kinjo Pier, athletes will evacuate to the nearest evacuation point. Transportation will then be arranged to relocate them to temporary accommodation such as hotels and other facilities.\"</p><p>The officials added that 'the safety and well-being of our athletes is always the top priority, not only for the OCA but also for the organising committee.'</p><p>\"The only concern is that there will be only one gangway onto the cruise ship, and the OCA is asking if there can be a second gangway to make sure there is no congestion entering or leaving the ship,\" Tiwari said. \"The organising committee will express this concern to the cruise ship company and hope that a solution can be found in time for this special mission.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0066297128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FTF-P743-RV5C-D31K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4163\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 15, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Business &amp;

On December 17, 2023, Somen Debnath's 19-year odyssey, during which he travelled to 191 countries, finally came full circle as he cycled his way back home to Basanti in the Sunderbans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Soon, he will bring out his book, The World Biking Odyssey: 191 Countries, documenting his adventures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He had started out aiming to create awareness about HIV/AIDS globally, which he did through lectures and interactions with underprivileged sections in urban, rural and tribal areas, as well as meeting students of schools, colleges, and universities worldwide.</p><p>\"I would encourage institutions to start chapters on HIV/AIDS awareness programmes and promote the use of (fresh) needles and syringes among drug- addicts, and the use of condoms among sex workers. My aim has also been to spread awareness among the youth and encourage NGOs in different countries,\" he says.</p><p>India, he found, was faring much better than many countries, with the National AIDS Control Organisation effectively deploying resources to have medicines reach affected people and conducting awareness programmes to reach vulnerable communities.</p><p>At 14, he came across a newspaper article, headlined \"AIDS is more deadly than cancer\" and started raising awareness about the disease.</p><p>The first step</p><p>Growing up in a large Bengali family, Debnath (40) was aware of the social norms by which a person's life is structured around getting a job, getting married and having children. \"I wanted to live a different life,\" he says.</p><p>At 14, he came across a newspaper article, headlined \"AIDS is more deadly than cancer\". He then started raising awareness about the disease at home and outside.</p><p>\"The second inspiration was Swami Vivekananda, who wrote in a book called Aamar Bharat Amar Bharat that if you want to see the world, see India, and when you go out into the world, you will find that in each corner of the world, there is an India. It came to my mind that when God gives me a chance, I would like to see India, the world, and how India exists in the world,\" says Debnath.</p><p>His third inspiration was Bimal Mukherjee, the first Indian globe-trotter, who travelled the world on a cycle from 1926 to 1937 - without a passport since this was the colonial era - and documented the experiences in the book, Du Chakay Duniya.</p><p>On May 27, 2004, two days after graduating in Zoology from the University of Kolkata, Debnath set off on his own cycling expedition with Rs 422 and no sponsorship. He relied on donations and support for his travels in India.</p><p>Then, he received financial support from the Ministry of External Affairs, then headed by Pranab Mukherjee, and four other ministries. This amounted to Rs 50,000, a number of letters and visas. \"That is a sort of contribution and support from the Central government, which went a little way. During my travels in different countries, I reached out to the Indian community as the main source of travel expenses,\" he says.</p><p>Debnath has lived through the 2004 Assam floods, a 2018 tornado in Florida, and the 2019 Typhoon Hagibis in Japan.</p><p>The route</p><p>From 2004 to 2007, Debnah charted a route through India's 28 states and five Union Territories, before heading out to 23 countries in Asia in the next two years, followed by 50 countries in Europe, and Greenland, from 2009 and 2012. Next, he visited 52 countries in Africa and eight countries in the Middle East until 2015.</p><p>From 2015 to 2020, Debnath cycled through 48 countries in South and North America, and Antarctica. Then, in February 2020, just as Covid-19 was about to become a pandemic, he found himself in China and the virus found him. \"Somehow, it was drinking boiled water that saved me, though I burnt my throat,\" he says.</p><p>He took a plane from China to South Korea, and eventually ended up spending the lockdown in New Zealand. \"The lockdown was quite hard, but I considered the fact that the whole world was more miserable than me,\" he says. It was 2022 before he could travel again, and visited Australia, Oceania and Southeast Asia before re-entering India.</p><p>The pandemic was just one of the many challenges that peppered his path. Debnath has lived through the 2004 Assam floods, a 2018 tornado in Florida, and the 2019 Typhoon Hagibis in Japan. He has been beaten up and even got lost in the Amazon. One of his near-death experiences was in Afghanistan, when he was stopped by four men with guns in a car, and at least one of them wanted to kill him because they thought he was an Indian Army soldier, he says. \"I was thinking that I need to speak. Otherwise, they will kill me. I understood only their body language, not their words. I told them that I was not in the Indian Army. I was travelling around the world, meeting people under pressure,\" he says.</p><p>He was blindfolded, taken \"I don't know where\", and beaten for four days until a translator arrived who could speak English. Debnath was asked about the Quran that he always carried in his bag, and his opinion of Islam and the Taliban. The experience ended with his being their prisoner, during which he offered to cook for them \"because their food was not delicious\".</p><p>\"One day, I made them lunch and they liked it. Thereafter, I made many spicy curries that I had learned from my mother and my Mejo Ma (second uncle's wife). I cooked different kinds of pakodas, biryani and many curries,\" he says. After 24 days of captivity, he was blindfolded and left 16 km from the Iraq border.</p><p>Back Home</p><p>On his journeys, Debnath would sometimes be joined by others on their cycles for distances between 20 and 500 km, \"Because people wanted to be part of my journey. But I was always alone. I never felt lonely because I think that life is a journey and made up of duty, duty and duty - duty to yourself, duty to others and duty to your God,\" he says.</p><p>Three of his cycles have been stolen, five he sent back home, and it was on his ninth cycle that Debnath arrived home. \"It is not the make of the cycle that is important, it is your mindset. You can go with a simple cycle and start your journey. What matters is how long you want to continue your journey,\" he says.</p><p>Debnath is back to a very different landscape. His brothers are married and have their families, as do his uncles. \"We are still a close family but people are living separately in the village,\" he says. The journey has also changed him, making him \"think positive and be optimistic\" in his way of life.</p><p>\"Though many things have changed in my home and the village, I am quite comfortable because life is about changing and I accept the knowledge,\" he says. He is working on his book, which will take a year, as well as a show of the paintings he made on his travels.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0063599168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8H-CKC1-DXMP-K1CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4163\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 6, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000051</classCode><className>AIDS &amp;

The system centrally collects and visualizes information at the time of a disaster, and supports the situational understanding and decision-making necessary for various judgments, in order to speed up and improve the accuracy of disaster response in small and medium-sized local governments such as cities, wards, towns, and villages.</p><p>This service adopts the subscription version of the \"EYE-BOUSAI + \" product lineup , a comprehensive disaster prevention information system provided by NTT DATA Kansai Corporation (hereinafter referred to as NTT DATA Kansai), which has the largest share of the market in prefectures and government-designated cities nationwide, and narrows down the various functions required for disaster response to the minimum necessary simple functions specialized for small and medium-sized municipalities, making it possible to introduce it according to budget. In addition, by providing a help desk function to ensure smooth use of the service and operational support functions such as training and operation support, it can be introduced and used with peace of mind even by small and medium-sized municipalities with limited resources.</p><p>1. Background and purpose of this initiative</p><p>The NTT East Group is leveraging the disaster response know-how it has cultivated in the telecommunications business sector and the know-how it has gained from building disaster-resistant communications infrastructure to ensure communications during disasters. In addition, the Group is working to solve local issues and realize sustainable development in local communities, for example by signing disaster cooperation agreements with various local governments.</p><p>As part of disaster preparedness, we have built and provided the comprehensive disaster prevention information system \"EYE-BOUSAI\" tailored to the needs of each local government. This system has been used at many disaster sites, including the Noto Peninsula earthquake that occurred in 2024, the East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis) and Kyushu heavy rains that occurred in 2019, the Western Japan heavy rains disaster, the Kumamoto earthquake, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Northern Osaka earthquake.</p><p>On the other hand, when it comes to introducing a system-based comprehensive disaster prevention information system, we have heard voices from employees of small and medium-sized municipalities with limited resources, in particular, who have given up on the introduction due to concerns about the cost burden in a municipality's budget constraints and the difficulty of learning how to operate it due to regular personnel transfers.As a result, many municipalities are forced to respond in an analog manner, such as managing disaster information on paper maps, management books, whiteboards, etc., and because it is difficult to share and visualize information, there are issues such as time required to respond when a disaster occurs and difficulty in accumulating and utilizing past response know-how.</p><p>This service allows small and medium-sized municipalities to introduce the service according to their budget by limiting some of the functions to the bare minimum. In addition, the service comes equipped with a menu to support operation after introduction, eliminating operational concerns of employees who actually use the service, and together we aim to promote digital transformation of disaster prevention, especially in small and medium-sized municipalities.</p><p>2. Functionality Overview</p><p>With this service, the basic functions have been narrowed down to those necessary for the main disaster response tasks of small and medium-sized municipalities, and a menu of support functions has been provided to help with familiarization with the system during peacetime.</p><p>* Automatically collect weather-related information and consolidate damage information, etc. in Chronology to centralize necessary information (Related functions: Map function, Chronology [*2] , Report reception)</p><p>*Not only those in the office, but also those on the go can register damage status, etc. (Related function: Mobile app)</p><p>*Visualized information allows for a bird's-eye view of the situation, and supports decision-making on issuing evacuation orders and opening evacuation shelters, etc. (Related functions: Dashboard, Evacuation Information Management, Evacuation Shelter Management)</p><p>* Transmitting necessary information to residents (Related functions: Bulk distribution/Disaster prevention web portal)</p><p>*Output data registered in the system, such as headquarters establishment, damage information, evacuation shelter information, and evacuation information, for summary reports at headquarters meetings and press releases (Related function: Summary report)</p><p>3. Features</p><p>(1) Provide comprehensive support, from learning the system to operating it during disaster prevention drills, etc.</p><p>It is equipped with a help desk function that handles inquiries about operation, reception of malfunctions, etc. In addition, for system users, practical operation support using this service in system familiarization training, disaster prevention training, and tabletop exercises will be provided by employees of the NTT East Group who have accumulated a wealth of know-how in the field of actual disasters.</p><p>For system operation support during disaster prevention training, tabletop exercises, etc., customers can choose from scenarios prepared by the customer or scenarios provided by our company that are based on actual operations.</p><p>(2) Disaster-resistant and flexible usage environment</p><p>This service has a high level of availability, allowing it to continue to be used even in the event of a large-scale disaster. The system can be connected via a web browser without a dedicated terminal, or via the General Government Network (LGWAN). In addition, in the event of a system failure, a cloud platform is used that allows instant system switching within the data center to ensure that the operation of this service is not affected. Furthermore, with robust data centers and redundancy at multiple locations across Japan, we provide an environment that allows you to use the service with peace of mind even in the event of a disaster.</p><p>(3) Introduction according to the budgets of small and medium-sized municipalities</p><p>The service is comprised of a basic menu that can be used for a basic fee and an initial cost, and an optional menu [*3] that allows each local government to freely select and use functions according to their needs, making it possible for small and medium-sized local governments to implement the service according to their budgets.</p><p>4.

nitf:lede=\"true\"> September 21 -- Japan's weather agency warned Saturday of \"unprecedented\" risks from a \"very dangerous\" typhoon heading towards the southern Kyushu island, urging residents to take shelter ahead of the storm.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>Typhoon Nanmadol was producing gusts of up to 270 kilometres (167 miles) an hour and classed as a \"violent\" storm, the agency's top level, on Saturday.<br/>By late afternoon it was approaching the remote Minami Daito island, 400 kilometres east of Okinawa island.<br/>The storm is expected to approach or make landfall on Sunday in Kyushu's southern Kagoshima prefecture, then move north the following day before heading towards Japan's main island.<br/>\"There are risks of unprecedented storms, high waves, storm surges, and record rainfall,\" Ryuta Kurora, the head of the Japan Meteorological Agency's forecast unit, told reporters.<br/>\"Maximum caution is required,\" he said, urging residents to evacuate early.<br/>\"It's a very dangerous typhoon.\"<br/>Kurora said the weather agency was likely to issue its highest alert later Saturday for the Kagoshima region.<br/>Called \"special warnings\", these are issued only when the JMA forecasts conditions seen once in a few decades.<br/>It would be the first typhoon-linked special warning issued outside of the Okinawa region since the current system began in 2013.<br/>\"The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse,\" Kurora told reporters, also warning of flooding and landslides.<br/>An evacuation \"instruction\"-level four on a five-level scale-is already in place for 330,000 people in Kagoshima, and authorities urged people to move to shelters or alternative accommodation before a top-level call was issued.<br/>Evacuation warnings in Japan are not mandatory, and during past extreme weather events authorities have struggled to convince residents to take shelter quickly enough.<br/>Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.<br/>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people.<br/>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka, killing 14 people.<br/>And in 2018, floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in western Japan during the country's annual rainy season.<br/>Ahead of Typhoon Nanmadol's arrival, flight cancellations began to affect regional airports including those in Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Kumamoto, according to the websites of Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways.<br/>Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

As extreme weather unfolds across the globe, people come to Twitter before, during, and after these events to talk about what's happening. Powered by social insights and analytics, these real-time conversations can be harnessed to provide instant alerts, relief efforts, and assessment of the situation on ground.</p><p><br/><br/>In India, we've witnessed Twitter doubling-up as a tool to support relief efforts during several natural crises. For calamities like the Goa floods of 2021, Cyclone Yaas and Cyclone Tauktae, Twitter has been a medium for official authorities/government bodies to stay in touch with the public and keep them informed around developments and rescue efforts. During the #ChiplunFlood in Maharashtra this year, residents took to Twitter to seek rescue help for themselves and their kin, and several turned up to amplify these calls.<br/><br/>Twitter provides companies and individuals with programmatic access to Twitter data through its public application programming interfaces (APIs), allowing them to build apps and tools for consumers to draw insights out of Twitter. Following natural disasters including the Jakarta flooding in Indonesia, Australian bushfires, and Typhoon Hagibis in Japan, Twitter worked with Peta Bencana and Twitter Official Partners like Brandwatch to help local communities understand trends in conversation data. In addition to using the service to share resources, raise funds and rally around one another, the Tweets create a wealth of social data that can be used to understand the issue of climate change and the crisis more broadly, while enabling policy makers to respond to future climate emergencies.<br/><br/>In collaboration with award winning creative studio Design I/O, Twitter has unveiled an interactive webpage that explores how conversations evolved on Twitter during each extreme weather event:<br/><br/>* Before: Even before the natural disaster affects areas, people Tweet about things they notice in nature, like higher water levels, or drier and hotter-than-usual temperatures. People also Tweet about their preparations, such as readying their home or neighbourhood for a fire, or creating flood or hurricane defences for critical structures.<br/><br/>* During: As the extreme weather event begins to affect people, alarms start to rise on Twitter. At the apex of such events, conversations on Twitter spike the most as people Tweet about what they are experiencing in real-time.<br/><br/>* After: At this time, the conversation on Twitter begins to shift towards humanitarian assistance like donation drives for supplies, rescue or medical assistance, and financial contributions to help people in the affected community.<br/><br/>Conversations heat up<br/><br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations' climate science research group, recently concluded in a report that human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe - including increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, and heavy precipitation.<br/><br/>The extent of extreme weather events is reflected in public conversations on Twitter too. A sample of English-language Tweets from 2013 to 2020 indicated that mentions of \"climate change\" grew an average of 50% each year.<br/><br/>These Tweets have proven to be powerful and influential as environmental activists use Twitter to raise awareness about the climate crisis, organize their communities, and connect with others passionate about protecting the planet.<br/><br/>\"Developers consistently inspire us with the ways they support people in crisis during natural disasters. The #ExtremeWeather visualization showcases what can be achieved when our developer and partner communities leverage the Twitter API and apply these insights to the public good. We hope this work sparks conversation, increases awareness and creates a connection between those passionate about climate change and disaster relief,\" said Amy Udelson, Head of Marketing for the Twitter Developer Platform.<br/><br/>By utilizing the vast amount of data about public conversation Twitter provides, developers have the opportunity to build solutions that help local communities during unforeseen extreme weather events, or study public sentiments about climate change without human bias.<br/><br/>Addressing the climate emergency together<br/><br/>Home to more than half of the world's population, the Asia Pacific region is one of the most vulnerable to the devastating effects of climate change. Twitter has played a critical role in providing actionable information during extreme weather events, and can continue to do so with the support and commitment from developers who are passionate about building for the climate crisis.<br/><br/>\"Twitter's uniquely open service has been used by people all around the world to share and exchange information in times of crisis. We recognize our responsibility in ensuring that people can find the information they need especially during a natural disaster, and have worked to amplify credible information from trusted media, government agencies, as well as relief and volunteer organizations,\" said Kathleen Reen, Senior Director Public Policy and Philanthropy, Asia Pacific at Twitter. \"We've seen how Twitter data can be used in real-time to provide vital support to people on the ground, and raise broader awareness and understanding of the impact of a crisis. As always, we remain committed to empowering more people to play an active role in driving positive social change, alongside our partners.\"<br/><br/>Case studies:<br/><br/>* Jakarta Floods by Peta Bencana: During the Jakarta floods, a Twitter bot developed by Peta Bencana used Tweets to the @PetaBencana account to create a flood map. This flood map was accessed over 259,000 times to understand the flooding situation, avoid flooded areas, and make decisions about safety and response. View the full case study here.<br/><br/>* Australia Bushfires by Brandwatch: During the bushfires in New South Wales from June 2019 to March 2020, Brandwatch, a Twitter Official Partner, analysed nearly 10 million Tweets from around the world. Through communities on Twitter, initiatives such as #AuthorsForFireys auctions and 'Find a bed' movement mobilised help and monetary support for those affected -- the latter accrued 7,000 listings and housed around 100 people within a week of its launch. View the full case study here.<br/><br/>* Typhoon Hagibis: When Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan in 2019, a Twitter Official Partner, analysed Twitter to detect keywords related to flooding, earthquakes, power outages and other disasters; their partner JX Press provided fast alerts, averaging 20 to 45 minutes before news outlets - helping the government effectively listen to and speak with the public during the emergency. View the full case study here.<br/><br/>* TexasFreeze by Sprout Social: The Texas Freeze, also known as the Texas power crisis, lasted for a two week and three day period from February 10 to 27th, 2021 when three winter storms, including a polar vortex, caused a massive electrical failure in Texas due to rare freezing temperatures. On February 18th, conversation about the #TexasFreeze peaked at 50,000 Tweets per day (Source).

As extreme weather unfolds across the globe, people come to Twitter before, during, and after these events to talk about what's happening. Powered by social insights and analytics, these real-time conversations can be harnessed to provide instant alerts, relief efforts, and assessment of the situation on ground.</p><p><br/>In India, we've witnessed Twitter doubling-up as a tool to support relief efforts during several natural crises. For calamities like the Goa floods of 2021, Cyclone Yaas and Cyclone Tauktae, Twitter has been a medium for official authorities/government bodies to stay in touch with the public and keep them informed around developments and rescue efforts. During the #ChiplunFlood in Maharashtra this year, residents took to Twitter to seek rescue help for themselves and their kin, and several turned up to amplify these calls.<br/>Twitter provides companies and individuals with programmatic access to Twitter data through its public application programming interfaces (APIs), allowing them to build apps and tools for consumers to draw insights out of Twitter. Following natural disasters including the Jakarta flooding in Indonesia, Australian bushfires, and Typhoon Hagibis in Japan, Twitter worked with Peta Bencana and Twitter Official Partners like Brandwatch to help local communities understand trends in conversation data. In addition to using the service to share resources, raise funds and rally around one another, the Tweets create a wealth of social data that can be used to understand the issue of climate change and the crisis more broadly, while enabling policy makers to respond to future climate emergencies.<br/>In collaboration with award winning creative studio Design I/O, Twitter has unveiled an interactive webpage that explores how conversations evolved on Twitter\u00a0 during each extreme weather event:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Before: Even before the natural disaster affects areas, people Tweet about things they notice in nature, like higher water levels, or drier and hotter-than-usual temperatures. People also Tweet about their preparations, such as readying their home or neighbourhood for a fire, or creating flood or hurricane defences for critical structures.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>During: As the extreme weather event begins to affect people, alarms start to rise on Twitter. At the apex of such events, conversations on Twitter spike the most as people Tweet about what they are experiencing in real-time.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>After: At this time, the conversation on Twitter begins to shift towards humanitarian assistance like donation drives for supplies, rescue or medical assistance, and financial contributions to help people in the affected community.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Conversations heat up<br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations' climate science research group, recently concluded in a report that human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe - including increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, and heavy precipitation.<br/>The extent of extreme weather events is reflected in public conversations on Twitter too. A sample of English-language Tweets from 2013 to 2020 indicated that mentions of \"climate change\" grew an average of 50% each year.<br/>These Tweets have proven to be powerful and influential as environmental activists use Twitter to raise awareness about the climate crisis, organize their communities, and connect with others passionate about protecting the planet.<br/>\"Developers consistently inspire us with the ways they support people in crisis during natural disasters. The #ExtremeWeather visualization showcases what can be achieved when our developer and partner communities leverage the Twitter API and apply these insights to the public good. We hope this work sparks conversation, increases awareness and creates a connection between those passionate about climate change and disaster relief,\" said Amy Udelson, Head of Marketing for the Twitter Developer Platform.<br/>By utilizing the vast amount of data about public conversation Twitter provides, developers have the opportunity to build solutions that help local communities during unforeseen extreme weather events, or study public sentiments about climate change without human bias.<br/>Addressing the climate emergency together<br/>Home to more than half of the world's population, the Asia Pacific region is one of the most vulnerable to the devastating effects of climate change. Twitter has played a critical role in providing actionable information during extreme weather events, and can continue to do so with the support and commitment from developers who are passionate about building for the climate crisis.<br/>\"Twitter's uniquely open service has been used by people all around the world to share and exchange information in times of crisis. We recognize our responsibility in ensuring that people can find the information they need especially during a natural disaster, and have worked to amplify credible information from trusted media, government agencies, as well as relief and volunteer organizations,\" said Kathleen Reen, Senior Director Public Policy and Philanthropy, Asia Pacific at Twitter. \"We've seen how Twitter data can be used in real-time to provide vital support to people on the ground, and raise broader awareness and understanding of the impact of a crisis. As always, we remain committed to empowering more people to play an active role in driving positive social change, alongside our partners.\"<br/>Case studies:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Jakarta Floods by Peta Bencana: During the Jakarta floods, a Twitter bot developed by Peta Bencana used Tweets to the @PetaBencana account to create a flood map.

According to the AFP report, by Sunday as many as 25,680 households in Kagoshima and neighbouring Miyazaki were already without power. Regional train services, flights and ferry runs were also cancelled until the passage of the storm, local utilities and transport services said, the report added. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) had said on Saturday that it was ready to issue a special typhoon warning for some areas in the countrys southwestern region of Kyushu as an unprecedented storm is expected to approach. Typhoon Nanmadol is expected to bring record rain to the prefecture and nearby areas with its expected landfall in Typhoon Nanmadol, with the weather agency calling for maximum vigilance as damaging winds and high waves are expected, possibly triggering landslides and flooding. Maximum caution is required, Ryuta Kurora, head of the JMAs forecast unit said on Saturday, according to the AFP report. Its a very dangerous typhoon. The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse, Kurora told reporters, also warning of flooding and landslides. So far, 2.9 million residents in Kyushu have been issued evacuation warnings, according to the governments Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The director of forecasts at the weather agency Ryuta Kurora said that the typhoon had rapidly intensified since Friday night and become a dangerous storm something people have never experienced before, said the AFP report. As of Saturday morning, Nanmadol, rated as large in scale and violent, was about 200 kilometers east of Minamidaito island and moving northwest at 10 kilometers per hour. It was carrying winds near its center of 198 kilometers per hour with maximum gusts of up to 270 kilometers per hour, with an atmospheric pressure of 910 hectopascals at its center. Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods, said the AFP report. In 2019, Japan endured Typhoon Hagibis while it hosted the Rugby World Cup. Over 100 people were killed in the typhoon. A year before, authorities had to shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka due to Typhoon Jebi, which killed 14 people. In 2018, more than 200 people were killed in floods and landslides in western Japan during the countrys annual rainy season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IBNS-0059359966</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66DM-56H1-JB5M-W0VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390022</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"447\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 India Blooms., distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IBNS</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 18, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001003</classCode><className>LANDSLIDES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001359</classCode><className>POWER FAILURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N483055OM</classCode><className>FERRIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX172</classCode><className>OSAKA, JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DAZF</classCode><className>KYUSHU, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He added that evacuation centres were also working on preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus by distributing disinfectant and asking evacuees to maintain their distance from each other. As of Saturday, some 200,000 have been ordered to evacuate their homes, according to Kyodo news agency. The floods are Japan's worst natural disaster since Typhoon Hagibis in October last year that left about 90 people dead. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132859159403371177925876100019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132859</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-Y3C1-F03R-N4M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484254</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"208\"/><timeReceived>11:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times India</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Looking forward, I am excited about our opportunities to build a bigger and more attractive portfolio and am confident in our ability to continue delivering long-term value.\"</p><p>Fourth Quarter of 2019 Summary</p><p>* During the fourth quarter of 2019, Typhoon Hagibis and losses associated with aggregate loss contracts (the \"2019 Aggregate Losses\") resulted in a net negative impact to net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $193.3 million. In addition, the Company reallocated certain losses from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai (collectively, the \"Q3 2019 Catastrophe Events\") to 2019 Aggregate Losses, which had no net impact on the Company's net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders.</p><p>* Gross premiums written increased by $357.7 million, or 65.3%, to $905.5 million, in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by an increase of $312.6 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment and an increase of $45.1 million in the Property segment. Included in gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $30.2 million of reinstatement premiums written primarily associated with Typhoon Hagibis. Included in the gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $102.5 million of reinstatement premiums written primarily associated with the wildfires in California during the fourth quarter of 2018 (the \"Q4 2018 California Wildfires\") and Hurricane Michael (collectively, the \"Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events\").</p><p>* Underwriting loss of $65.2 million and a combined ratio of 106.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $82.3 million and a combined ratio of 114.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $87.1 million and had a combined ratio of 118.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Casualty and Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $20.8 million and had a combined ratio of 95.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Company's underwriting results in the fourth quarter of 2019 were principally impacted by Typhoon Hagibis and the 2019 Aggregate Losses, which had a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $237.0 million and added 25.0 percentage points to the combined ratio.</p><p>* Total investment result was a gain of $130.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, generating an annualized total investment return of 3.1%.</p><p>* Over $300 million of capital raised in the fourth quarter of 2019 through the Company's managed joint ventures and third-party capital vehicles, including Vermeer Reinsurance Ltd. (\"Vermeer\"), Upsilon RFO Re Ltd. (\"Upsilon RFO\") and RenaissanceRe Medici Fund Ltd (\"Medici\").</p><p>Net Negative Impact</p><p>Net negative impact includes the sum of estimates of net claims and claim expenses incurred, earned reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, lost profit commissions and redeemable noncontrolling interest. The Company's estimates of net negative impact are based on a review of its potential exposures, preliminary discussions with certain counterparties and catastrophe modeling techniques. The Company's actual net negative impact, both individually and in the aggregate, may vary from these estimates, perhaps materially. Changes in these estimates will be recorded in the period in which they occur.</p><p>Meaningful uncertainty regarding the estimates and the nature and extent of the losses from these events remains, driven by the magnitude and recent occurrence of each event, the geographic areas in which the events occurred, relatively limited claims data received to date, the contingent nature of business interruption and other exposures, potential uncertainties relating to reinsurance recoveries and other factors inherent in loss estimation, among other things.</p><p>The financial data in the table below provides additional information detailing the net negative impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulting from Typhoon Hagibis, the 2019 Aggregate Losses and a reallocation of certain losses from the Q3 2019 Catastrophe Events to 2019 Aggregate Losses.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company announced a preliminary estimated net negative impact on net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of losses from Typhoon Hagibis of approximately $175 million on its fourth quarter 2019 results of operations. The Company's estimated net negative impact from Typhoon Hagibis remains consistent with this initial estimate and is allocated between the Typhoon Hagibis column and the 2019 Aggregate Loss column in the table below.</p><p>During the third quarter of 2019, the Company's initial estimate of the net negative impact of the Q3 2019 Catastrophe Events included loss estimates associated with aggregate loss contracts. Certain of those contracts have been reallocated to 2019 Aggregate Losses, with a comparable change reflected as a reduction to the Q3 2019 Catastrophe Events in the table below.</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.renre.com/news-releases/news-release-details/renaissancere-reports-fourth-quarter-2019-net-income-available\">https://investor.renre.com/news-releases/news-release-details/renaissancere-reports-fourth-quarter-2019-net-income-available</url>)</p><p>Acquisition of Tokio Millennium Re</p><p>On March 22, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Tokio Millennium Re AG (now known as RenaissanceRe Europe AG), Tokio Millennium Re (UK) Limited (now known as RenaissanceRe (UK) Limited) and their subsidiaries (collectively, \"TMR\"). The Company accounted for the acquisition of TMR under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic Business Combinations. The operating activities of TMR are included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from March 22, 2019, and comparisons of the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 to the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 should be viewed in that context. In addition, the results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 may not be reflective of the ultimate ongoing business of the combined entities.</p><p>Underwriting Results by Segment</p><p>Property Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written in the Property segment were $245.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $45.1 million, or 22.6%, compared to $199.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $44.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $64.1 million, or 58.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business included $29.5 million of reinstatement premiums primarily associated with Typhoon Hagibis, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which included $102.8 million of reinstatement premiums associated with the Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the other property class of business were $200.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $109.2 million, or 120.0%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities across a number of the Company's underwriting platforms and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Ceded premiums written in the Property segment were $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $27.2 million, or 92.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in ceded premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2019 was principally due to $26.0 million of ceded reinstatement premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2018 associated with Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events which did not reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>The Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $87.1 million and had a combined ratio of 118.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $35.0 million and a combined ratio of 110.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 were principally impacted by Typhoon Hagibis and the 2019 Aggregate Losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $235.5 million and added 52.5 percentage points to the Property segment combined ratio.</p><p>In comparison, the fourth quarter of 2018 was impacted by the Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events and changes in certain losses associated with aggregate loss contracts in 2018 (the \"2018 Aggregate Losses\"), which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $205.7 million and added 74.1 percentage points to the Property segment combined ratio. In addition, the underwriting results in the fourth quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by changes in the estimates of the net negative impact of the wildfires in California during the third quarter of 2018 (the \"Q3 2018 California Wildfires\"), Typhoons Jebi, Mangkhut and Trami, and Hurricane Florence (collectively, the \"Q3 2018 Catastrophe Events\") and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Mexico City Earthquake, the wildfires in California during the fourth quarter of 2017 and certain losses associated with aggregate loss contracts (collectively, the \"2017 Large Loss Events\") of $55.2 million and $24.8 million, respectively, reducing the Property segment combined ratio by 17.7 and 7.9 percentage points, respectively.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment were $660.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $312.6 million, or 89.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was due to growth from new and existing business opportunities written in the current and prior periods across various classes of business within the segment, and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>The Casualty and Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $20.8 million and had a combined ratio of 95.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $47.4 million and a combined ratio of 119.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement in the Casualty and Specialty segment combined ratio was driven by a decrease of 14.8 percentage points in the net claims and claim expense ratio, principally the result of lower current accident year losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which included loss estimates for liability exposures associated with the Q4 2018 California Wildfires. The Casualty and Specialty segment also experienced an 8.6 percentage point decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting from a decrease in both the acquisition expense ratio and the operating expense ratio. The acquisition ratio decreased in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of the effects of purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition of TMR and changes in estimated commissions. The operating expense ratio decreased 3.6 percentage points due to improved operating leverage from the business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Other Items</p><p>* The Company's total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains on investments, was a gain of $130.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a loss of $35.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an improvement of $165.9 million. The improvement in the total investment result was principally due to higher returns on the Company's equity investments trading, private equity investments and catastrophe bonds, partially offset by lower returns on its portfolio of fixed maturity investments trading. Also driving the investment result for the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher average invested assets primarily resulting from the acquisition of TMR, combined with capital raised during 2019 in certain of the Company's consolidated third-party capital vehicles, including DaVinciRe Holdings Ltd. (\"DaVinciRe\"), Upsilon RFO, Vermeer and Medici, and the subsequent investment of those funds as part of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio.</p><p>* Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $2.6 million compared to $49.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The change was primarily driven by improved performance from DaVinciRe in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which was negatively impacted by significant losses in DaVinciRe associated with Hurricane Michael, the Q4 2018 California Wildfires and changes in the 2018 Aggregate Losses. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2019 included net income attributable to Vermeer and improved performance in Medici.</p><p>* In the fourth quarter of 2019, total fee income increased by $4.6 million, to $13.2 million, compared to $8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by an increase in the dollar value of capital being managed combined with improved underlying performance.</p><p>FULL YEAR 2019 SUMMARY</p><p>* Gross premiums written increased by $1.5 billion, or 45.2%, to $4.8 billion, in 2019, compared to 2018, driven by increases of $670.1 million in the Property segment and $827.3 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment. The increase was primarily driven by expanded participation on existing transactions, certain new transactions, rate improvements, and the impact of the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>* Underwriting income of $256.4 million and a combined ratio of 92.3% in 2019, compared to underwriting income of $244.9 million and a combined ratio of 87.6% in 2018. Underwriting income was comprised of $209.3 million in the Property segment and $46.0 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment. Impacting the underwriting result for 2019 were Typhoon Hagibis, the Q3 2019 Catastrophe Events and 2019 Aggregate Losses (collectively, the \"2019 Large Loss Events\"), which had a net negative impact on the Company's underwriting result of $418.9 million and added 12.9 percentage points to the combined ratio.</p><p>* Net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $712.0 million in 2019 included total net negative impact on the Company's net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $348.2 million from the 2019 Large Loss Events.</p><p>* Total investment result was a gain of $838.3 million in 2019, generating an annualized total investment return of 5.2%. The Company's portfolio of fixed maturity and short term investments had a yield to maturity of 2.1% at December 31, 2019, contributing $423.8 million of net investment income included in the total investment result in 2019.</p><p>* Over $1.5 billion of capital raised in 2019 through the Company's managed joint ventures and third-party capital vehicles, DaVinciRe, Upsilon RFO, Vermeer and Medici, including $175 million from the Company. In addition, effective January 1, 2020, the Company raised over $625 million of capital through Upsilon RFO and Medici, including over $100 million from the Company.</p><p>Net Negative Impact</p><p>The financial data below provides additional information detailing the net negative impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements in 2019 resulting from the 2019 Large Loss Events, including Typhoon Hagibis, the Q3 2019 Catastrophe Events and the 2019 Aggregate Losses.</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.renre.com/news-releases/news-release-details/renaissancere-reports-fourth-quarter-2019-net-income-available\">https://investor.renre.com/news-releases/news-release-details/renaissancere-reports-fourth-quarter-2019-net-income-available</url>)</p><p>Underwriting Results by Segment</p><p>Property Segment</p><p>In 2019, gross premiums written in the Property segment increased by $670.1 million, or 38.1%, to $2.4 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in 2018.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $1.6 billion in 2019, an increase of $246.1 million, or 18.2%, compared to 2018. Impacting the catastrophe class of business in 2019 were expanded participation on existing transactions, certain new transactions, rate improvements, and the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the other property class of business were $835.5 million in 2019, an increase of $423.9 million, or 103.0%, compared to 2018. The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by growth across the Company's underwriting platforms, both from existing relationships and through new opportunities the Company believes have comparably attractive risk-return attributes, rate improvements, and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>The Company's Property segment generated underwriting income of $209.3 million in 2019, compared to $262.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $52.8 million. In 2019, the Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 59.3%, an underwriting expense ratio of 27.8% and a combined ratio of 87.1%, compared to 47.4%, 27.7% and 75.1%, respectively, in 2018.</p><p>Principally impacting the Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in 2019 were the 2019 Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $414.4 million and a corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of 26.7 percentage points. In comparison, 2018 was impacted by the Q3 2018 Catastrophe Events, the Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events, and the 2018 Aggregate Losses (collectively, the \"2018 Large Loss Events\"). The 2018 Large Loss Events resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $338.7 million, and a corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of 37.4 percentage points. This was partially offset by a net positive impact on the underwriting result associated with changes in the estimates of the net negative impact on the underwriting result of the 2017 Large Loss Events of $145.7 million, and a corresponding decrease in the combined ratio of 14.0 percentage points.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty Segment</p><p>In 2019, gross premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment increased by $827.3 million, or 53.4%, to $2.4 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2018. The increase was principally due to growth from new and existing business opportunities written in the current and prior periods across various classes of business within the segment and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>The Company's Casualty and Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $46.0 million in 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $17.0 million in 2018. In 2019, the Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 66.1%, an underwriting expense ratio of 31.2% and a combined ratio of 97.3%, compared to 67.3%, 34.5% and 101.8%, respectively, in 2018.</p><p>The decrease in the Company's Casualty and Specialty segment's combined ratio was primarily driven by an improved underwriting expense ratio as well as the overall decrease in the net claims and claim expense ratio. The decrease in the Casualty and Specialty segment net claims and claim expense ratio was principally due to lower current accident year losses, which reduced the net claims and claim expense ratio by 5.1 percentage points in 2019, compared to 2018, which was adversely impacted by liability exposures associated with the Q3 2018 California Wildfires and the Q4 2018 California Wildfires. The underwriting expense ratio in the Casualty and Specialty segment decreased 3.3 percentage points, to 31.2%, in 2019, compared to 34.5% in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in the operating expense ratio as a result of improved operating leverage.</p><p>Other Items</p><p>* Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2019 was $201.5 million, compared to $41.6 million in 2018, an increase of $159.9 million, principally due to improved performance from DaVinciRe and the addition of net income attributable to Vermeer in 2019, compared to 2018, which was negatively impacted by significant losses in DaVinciRe associated with Hurricane Michael, the Q4 2018 California Wildfires and changes in the 2018 Aggregate Losses.</p><p>* In 2019, total fee income increased by $24.3 million, to $114.2 million, compared to $89.9 million in 2018, primarily driven by an increase in the dollar value of capital being managed and improved underlying performance.</p><p>* The Company's total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, was $838.3 million in 2019, compared to $86.8 million in 2018, an increase of $751.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $414.5 million in 2019, compared to net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $175.1 million in 2018. The net realized and unrealized gains on investments in 2019 were driven by net realized and unrealized gains on the fixed maturity investments portfolio, equity investments trading and investment-related derivatives. Additionally, higher net investment income was generated from the Company's portfolio of fixed maturity investments trading, short term investments, private equity investments and catastrophe bonds. Also driving the investment result for 2019 were higher average invested assets primarily resulting from the acquisition of TMR, combined with capital raised during 2019 in certain of the Company's consolidated third-party capital vehicles, including DaVinciRe, Upsilon RFO, Vermeer and Medici, and the subsequent investment of those funds as part of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio.</p><p>* During 2019, the Company recorded $49.7 million of corporate expenses associated with the acquisition of TMR, which includes compensation-related costs, integration-related costs and transaction-related costs.</p><p>* On April 2, 2019, the Company issued $400.0 million of its 3.600% Senior Notes due April 15, 2029. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay, in full, $200.0 million outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility, which was drawn on March 20, 2019 in connection with the acquisition of TMR. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.</p><p>* On February 4, 2020, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, RenaissanceRe Specialty Holdings (UK) Limited, entered into an agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, RenaissanceRe (UK) Limited, a UK run-off company, to an investment vehicle managed by AXA Liabilities Managers, an affiliate of AXA XL.

Naruhito addressed the tens of thousands of well-wishers, many of whom waving Japanese flags and shouting Banzai, meaning long life in his first New year speech since ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne.\u00a0The 59-year-old emperor, accompanied by Empress Masako, said he was glad to celebrate the New Year together with the people. He however said he was worried about many people still living difficult lives because of typhoons and heavy rain last year. The royal couple, visited people last month in Japan's northeastern region hit by powerful typhoon Hagibis. More than 80 people were killed in the disaster which also caused huge damage to local infrastructure.Also attending the traditional New Year celebration was Naruhito's father Akihito, who became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in around two centuries when he stepped down from the throne on April 30, ending his three-decade reign.The central Tokyo palace, surrounded by stone walls and moats, is opened to the public twice a year, on the emperor's birthday and the second day of New Year, for the royal family to greet well-wishers. The emperor will appear four more times at the balcony later in the day.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCIND-M-465252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCIND2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWH-H9C1-JBYT-H3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410716</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"217\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Inc.

The reigning AEW World Champion, who is also the current IWGP US Heavyweight Champion, is expected to defend his NJPW title against KENTA.</p><p><br/>Speaking of whom, in the aftermath of the recent Road To Power Struggle post-show, KENTA sent yet another message to The Death Rider. Following the Bullet Club's multi-man tag match on the night, the former WWE Superstar claimed that he will be the first Japanese IWGP United States Champion.<br/>Ending his short but stern message, KENTA also warned Moxley by stating that he's coming for the current champion before Too Sweeting the camera. The No. 1 contender's message can be seen below, along with other comments from the likes of Jay White, Hiroshi Tanahashi, and Chase Owens.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>KENTA vs. Jon Moxley in the makingJon Moxley became a two-time IWGP United States Champion earlier in the year at Wrestle Kingdom 14. Moxley defeated his arch-rival and fellow AEW colleague Lance Archer and followed it up with another successful defense against Juice Robinson the next night.<br/>While Jon Moxley has been forced to stay out of Japan due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it definitely remains possible for him to return to the country before 2021. The Death Rider is expected to defend his IWGP US Title at Wrestle Kingdom, if not prior.<br/>While KENTA has a guaranteed title shot against Moxley in the future, it remains to be seen when NJPW eventually decides to book the title match.

At last year's Zozo Championship, the energy was palpable. It was an electric blend of captivating golf down the stretch between Woods and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, combined with a country eager to momentarily escape the devastation left in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis.The extremely violent weather phenomenon, which struck Japan on October 12, 2019, caused more than $15 million in damage and killed 98, the deadliest typhoon to hit the island since 1979. But for a moment, people cheered, celebrating golf and a temporary sense of normal. </p><p>\"It was a tough situation for the entire area and all of Japan quite frankly,\" Woods said. \"To have that excitement, that level of excitement for the game of golf, and to have all those people out there watching us, watching us play, to have Hideki right there in the mix as well. It was a great event for all of Japan, and I was lucky enough to have won.\"The 2020 installment of the PGA Tour event will have a vastly different energy to go along with a new, but temporary, location and feel. Relocated to Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California, because of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the defending champion has a chance to go back-to-back while making history in a place that is unquestionably familiar. The Hero World Challenge, the event that Woods hosts every December, spent 14 of its first 15 years here. Woods enters the Zozo Championship @ Sherwood with 82 PGA Tour wins all-time, tying him with Sam Sneed for the most in Tour history. The 44-year-old will have to get the record-breaking outcome without the support of a raucous crowd, as spectators remain off limits to limit the chance of viral transmission. Ironically, the 2019 Zozo Championship victory was Woods' last on the Tour. He's played a mere seven times since that final round in Japan, including just four tournaments since the COVID-19 pandemic started in March. Familiarity with the course could provide a boost, but the tournament's environment will be a far cry from the event Woods is accustomed to playing at Sherwood. The Hero World Challenge traditionally features a 16-man field, including the defending champion, the top 11 available players from the World Golf Rankings and four sponsor exemptions selected by the Woods' foundation. More faces, more competition and more at-stake - all things Woods is preparing to take on. \"Let's just say that the field is a lot bigger than normally when I have played here. I only had to beat 11 other guys, so that's very different,\" Woods said. \"This golf course - I need to get another look at it tomorrow on the front nine, because the greens are definitely different than last time we played here. Hopefully, everything comes together starting from Thursday and have a great week.\" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOI-78788283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6142-1D31-DXJR-H4WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Argos results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year are clearly unacceptable, said Argo Group Interim CEO Kevin Rehnberg. The industry is experiencing rising claims severity in several lines of business. We have taken appropriate action to adjust our current and prior accident year loss ratios in response to these conditions and to specific information received in the quarter. We believe the actions taken strengthen our balance sheet and position us for a more profitable future. We are experiencing substantial rate increases across our platform, with strong double-digit gains in International and certain U.S. liability lines. Our capital position remains strong, we are continuing to refine our product strategies and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the specialty commercial insurance marketplace.</p><p>Key items affecting the fourth quarter include:</p><p>Prior accident year losses of approximately $77 million or 18.0 points on Argos consolidated loss ratio for the fourth quarter. Reserve increases were related to the Companys London, Bermuda Insurance and European business units within Argos International Operations, as well as property, professional and liability lines within Argos U.S. Operations. Prior accident year losses in both segments were the result of new information received in the quarter relating to claims trends across various lines of business, as well as a continued review of International business currently in run-off. Prior year losses also include the conclusion of Argos annual review of Run-off reserves, which resulted in a $10 million reserve increase.</p><p>Current accident year losses of approximately $30 million, or an additional 6 points when compared to the third quarter 2019 year-to-date current accident year loss ratio of 59%. The adjustment reflects a change in actuarial estimates based on a more uncertain claims environment and the recalibration of the current year based on prior accident year loss adjustments.</p><p>Catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums of approximately $3 million, or 0.5 points on Argos consolidated loss ratio for the fourth quarter. Catastrophe losses were primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis and were partially offset by a modest reduction to estimated losses for prior quarter events.</p><p>Additional operating expenses of approximately $12 million or 2.9 points related to costs associated with a reduction in workforce, an allowance for doubtful accounts related to our European business unit, and adjustments to underwriting expenses based on certain costs previously allocated to investment functions and trade capital providers. Based on these items discussed above, Argo expects to report an underwriting loss of approximately $114 million for the quarter.</p><p>Additionally, several non-operating charges will be reflected in fourth quarter results:</p><p>As part of an ongoing strategic review and recent operating results, a goodwill impairment of approximately $16 million related to Argos European business unit.</p><p>Expenses of approximately $18 million related to losses and impairments on certain long-lived assets that are held for sale, primarily a corporate aircraft and real estate properties; the cancellation of contracts related to certain sponsorships and marketing services; and to severance costs associated with separation from Argos former CEO.</p><p>Other corporate expenses of approximately $8 million, which primarily resulted from costs related to the previously announced independent directors review of certain governance and compensation matters and Argos cooperation agreement with Voce Capital.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-167510191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7C-95M1-JDJN-61HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

(\"Third Point Re\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:TPRE) today announced results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings Summary</p><p>Third Point Re reported net income available to common shareholders of $134.4 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $29.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Third Point Re reported net income available to common shareholders of $143.5 million, or $1.53 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $200.6 million, or $2.16 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.</p><p>\"For the fourth quarter, we produced a return on equity of 9.4% driven by strong investment performance. Our diluted book value per share at the end of the quarter was $16.42. The combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 123.0%, which included $37.2 million, or 20.4 percentage points on the combined ratio related to prior year reserve development where we increased certain casualty reserves in response to our accumulated loss experience and the broader industry trends of social inflation. Our fourth quarter results also included $18.6 million attributable to catastrophe losses and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, for a total impact of 10.2 percentage points on the combined ratio,\" commented Dan Malloy, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our previously announced merger with Sirius Group is expected to close on February 26 and we are looking forward to welcoming our new colleagues.\"</p><p>Sid Sankaran, Chairman of the Company commented, \"While we are not satisfied with the underwriting results in 2020, with the exceptional talent, global footprint and robust balance sheet of the combined company, we will have a strong base for building an innovative, disciplined and sustainable business. We are aiming to enhance our existing relationships and improve the economics of our key lines of business, while looking at ways that we can grow intelligently and leverage technology to improve how we manage risk, use data and develop new strategic opportunities.\"</p><p>Additional Information on Financial Results</p><p>The following table shows certain key financial metrics for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thirdpointre.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Third-Point-Re-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.thirdpointre.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Third-Point-Re-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written</p><p>Gross premiums written increased by $31.4 million, or 23.4%, to $165.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 from $134.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to $45.5 million of new casualty premium written in the period, including $19.0 million from Arcadian.</p><p>Gross premiums written decreased by $43.8 million, or 6.9%, to $588.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from $631.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to certain contracts that we did not renew, including certain contracts which no longer fit our underwriting criteria as a result of our shift in underwriting strategy. This decrease was partially offset by new contracts bound in the current year.</p><p>Net underwriting results</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $7.0 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 3.8 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta, compared to $16.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019, or 8.2 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $36.6 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 6.0 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to Hurricane Laura and other 2020 catastrophes, compared to $29.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 4.1 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak is causing unprecedented social disruption, global economic volatility, reduced liquidity of capital markets and intervention by various governments around the world. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net losses of $11.6 million and $46.7 million, respectively, net of additional premiums, or 6.4 and 7.6 percentage points, respectively, on the combined ratio, relating to COVID-19. These losses were driven primarily by event cancellation, property business interruption, and certain casualty and multi-line quota share contracts.</p><p>The economic impact of the ongoing pandemic will continue to create uncertainty around the ultimate scope of claims and potential for additional insurance losses. Our estimate is based on currently available information provided by cedents. These estimates include losses only related to our estimate of claims incurred as of December 31, 2020.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase in net underwriting loss of $37.2 million and $34.6 million, respectively, related to net adverse development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs. The adverse underwriting loss development is a result of accumulated loss experience and cedent reserving increases, indicating that underlying casualty loss trends are higher than initial pricing and reserving, consistent with the industry impact of social inflation. In addition, the current elevated level of uncertainty makes historical data less applicable for future projections, and has contributed to an increase in the estimate of ultimate losses on certain accounts.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net $1.1 million and $5.4 million improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to net favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p><p>Investments</p><p>The following is a summary of our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thirdpointre.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Third-Point-Re-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.thirdpointre.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Third-Point-Re-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities. Activist positions also performed strongly, helping offset losses earlier in the year in this category. The credit strategy contributed gains from both the corporate credit and structured credit portfolios. In the other strategy, gains were driven by private investments.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities, in particular a renewed focus on growth and technology positions. Short equity investments and hedges partially offset overall gains for the equity strategy. Investments in investment grade corporate credit and residential mortgage backed securities contributed strong performance in the credit strategy. The other strategy contributed modestly to net gains for the year due to private investments.</p><p>Sirius Merger</p><p>On August 6, 2020, Third Point Re, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among the Company, Sirius International Insurance Group, Ltd.

We were astonished by the warmth with which the delegation was greeted by Japanese counterparts. Quite remarkably, the travel itinerary and official engagements over 5 days visit remained unchanged and executed by our hosts as planned. Further, we were overwhelmed by the preparations for the visit of around 2,000 dignitaries from around 200 countries for the Coronation Ceremony of Emperor Naruhito of Japan the week after, which was unwavered by the wrath of super Typhoon Hagibis. We visited Roppongi Grand Tower, a 231 metre tall building in heart of Tokyo, developed by Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development Company. On our enquiry whether super Typhoon had any impact on the Grand Tower, the CEO seemed as unmoved as the gleaming skyscraper, standing out in the Roppongi skyline.</p><p>Japan is not new to disasters- the most devastating being Great Hanshin earthquake 1995, Great East Japan earthquake 2011 and Tsunami which triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Over the course of time, Japan's national spirit has been synonymous with utmost resilience, reinforced by Japan's ability to handle natural disasters in a well prepared and timely manner. Japan's political and economic commitment to disaster risk reduction and resilience has been a leading example for the whole world to see.</p><p>In India as well, natural disasters are a common phenomenon. Cyclone Fani wreaked havoc in Odisha. The preparedness of disaster management authorities was well appreciated across the world, when the coastal authorities in Odisha moved more than a million people from the area within Cyclone Fani's projected path onto higher ground, significantly reducing the death toll to 89. India's preparedness for natural disasters has increased a lot in recent times, but there is still a long way to emulate the Japanese spirit.</p><p>During the visit to Tokyo Tower, we saw a movie depicting the series of events in World War II, culminating in atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 when the whole nation came to a standstill. The movie recounted the carpet \"Bombing of Tokyo\", when the entire city was ravaged by a series of firebomb assaults, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead and over 1 million homeless. Significant city monuments like Tokyo station were also destroyed. In the 1950s, Japan, still ravaged by the war, aimed to become modern, peaceful and part of the world's economic elite. One of the key elements in the construction of this renewed Japanese society was building of a monument to symbolize Japan's ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse. This led to the planning of Tokyo Tower by Hisakichi Maeda, to be taller than Empire State Building and Eiffel Tower, among the tallest structures in the world. The building of Tokyo Tower attracted thousands of Japanese construction workers and instilled a greater sense of nationalism in the hearts of Japanese people, at a time when it was needed the most. Tokyo Tower glorified their engineering and technical prowess and showed the world that it was way ahead of its time. By the end of 1958, the Tokyo Tower was finished and presented to the public as the world's tallest freestanding tower at the time, taller than Eiffel Tower. During the same period, the Japanese economy resurged and the tower signified the post-war recovery phase and the Japanese spirit.</p><p>In 1964, Japan became the center of attention for the world when they hosted the Tokyo Olympics with immense aplomb and success, announcing their comeback to the global stage. It was a massive undertaking at the national level, with some estimates suggesting that Tokyo spent the equivalent of its national budget at that time on a major integrated development program which transformed the city's infrastructure. Simultaneously, completion of many large-scale infrastructure projects was timed to coincide with the 1964 Olympics, including the launch of the globally famous Shinkansen bullet train. Tokyo Station was rebuilt as a heritage building by innovative selling of air rights to enable an integrated development of the entire area. The collective effort of the entire nation driving the resurgence of the nation's economy, is what impressed us the most.</p><p>India too has a rich history and culture. Over the course of the colonial rule, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, popularly remembered as Iron Man of India, successfully imbibed the spirit of solidarity within the citizens of the country. To realize his vision, 'Statue of Unity' was unveiled as world's tallest statue in 2018, taller than the Statue of Liberty. Many people initially expressed discontent at the expenditure on the statue being exorbitantly high. Lately, the monument has witnessed high tourist footfalls, making it one of the most visited destinations across the country. Like Tokyo Tower of Japan, the 'Statue of Unity' of India will serve as a symbol to imbibe a sense of national purpose in hearts of 130 crore Indians, immensely essential to embark on building a strong, prosperous and inclusive India and to ensure that the fruits of development reach the bottom of pyramid.</p><p>India is working towards the holistic achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goals, taking unprecedented leaps under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Running world's biggest health assurance scheme covering 500 million citizens, world's biggest financial inclusion scheme opening over 370 million bank accounts for the poor, India draws inspiration from 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas'. The efforts are ours, but their fruits are for global humanity. In 2014, India was lagging behind in sanitation and an Open Defecation Free (ODF) India seemed a far-fetched dream, with less than 50% of households in the country having access to sanitation facilities. Yet, India has been able to successfully implement the world's largest sanitation programme underSwachh Bharat Mission, building 110 million toilets in just 5 years, a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150 Birth Anniversary on 2 October,2019.Swach Bharat Mission has turned into a Jan Andolan, catalyzed by behavioral transformation led by 130 crore Indians. On one hand, India is committed to achieving the target of 450 GW of renewable energy and on the other hand India is leading the initiatives like International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, shining examples of her ever-growing global influence.</p><p>India is one of the fastest growing nations, with an annual average economic growth of 7.5% over the last 5 years, coupled with low inflation and low fiscal deficits. In the last 4 years, India has jumped 79 positions in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings, currently ranked at 63, being the only large country in the world to witness such monumental progress. The jump of 25 places in EODB in Construction Permits is unprecedented, considering last year's jump was 129 places. Recently, reforms and policy measures in the country have ensured commitment towards a \"one nation one belief\" approach, charting its way towards realizing the vision of a USD 5 trillion dollar economy.</p><p>India needs to address the challenge of engaging with modernity and economic development with cultural preservation, learning from Japan. With focus on modernization, Japan has always aspired to achieve their development goals through state-led encouragement of a nation-wide and collective effort. Japanese people have always leaned on their own unique culture, despite the global wave of westernization. Their united effort at improving themselves, focusing on their internal strengths and competencies is commendable. Japanese spirit of embracing challenge with spirit and camaraderie has synergies with Indian ethos. The advanced, precision manufacturing and kaizen quality control principles are leading examples for the rest of the world. Thus, a lot of lessons can be taken from the Japanese national spirit of collectivism and unity. Similarly, our country can realize its vision for equitable growth by incorporating a sense of national pride amongst its citizens through projects of national integration, ensuring that each one of us contributes towards the natural goal of meeting the aspirations of New India.</p><p>Shri Durga Shanker Mishra is currently Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) and views expressed in the article are his own in personal capacity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRNWS-0053238654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWP-4S51-DXMP-K35H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indian National Press Bombay Ltd, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Free Press Journal (India)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002AEV</classCode><className>SUMITOMO REALTY &amp;

With many rivers overflowing into residential areas across a wide area of the country, rescue operations were underway in central, eastern and northeastern regions that were hit by floods and landslides. As of 0800 hrs (local time) on Sunday, more than 250,000 households in the Tokyo metropolitan area and nearby regions were without electricity. </p><p>Among them, some 109,100 households were out of power in Chiba Prefecture, which was hit hard by Typhoon Faxai in early September. Strong winds associated with the typhoon may sever power lines, and trees and signboards may come into contact with those hanging cables, Tokyo Electric Power Company said. The company called on people not to approach or touch such cables because they may be electrocuted. Tokyos Haneda airport and most Shinkansen bullet train services resumed operations from Sunday morning following large-scale suspensions Saturday. Many flights to and from Haneda airport for Sunday have already been canceled, while operations of Tokyos subways were initially suspended in the early morning hours for safety checks. Over six million people across Japans main island of Honshu have been advised to evacuate. By early Sunday, the authorities have lifted evacuation advisories in Tokyo and most of central and eastern Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency had previously issued the highest heavy rain emergency warning on its one-to-five scale for Tokyo and the prefectures of Gunma, Saitama, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Nagano, Shizuoka, Niigata and Fukushima. As of Sunday morning, all such warnings have been lifted. The agency continued to call on people to remain on alert for flooding and landslides. According to the agency, as of 0700 hrs local time Sunday, Typhoon Hagibis was traveling 130 km off Miyako, Iwate Prefecture. It had an atmospheric pressure of 975 hectopascals at its center and was packing winds of up to 162 km per hour. After passing through the Tokyo metropolitan area and part of northeastern Japan, the typhoon is now off the Pacific coast and moving away from the Japanese archipelago. It is expected to weaken to an extratropical cyclone on Sunday afternoon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IBNS-0049909753</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-CST1-DXMP-K2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390022</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 India Blooms., distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IBNS</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 13, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In fact it was an historic amount of intensification in such a short time,\" he said. <br/> The waves were expected to increase significantly in height throughout the Pacific coast of the country from Friday, and that from Saturday there will be torrential rains in the south, west and center, including the Greater Tokyo Area, as the typhoon advances north.<br/> --IANS<br/> sdr/in <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IANSEN-A-71482</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IANSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9H-5JP1-DYDW-74JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410748</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"232\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IANS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IANS-English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20484\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST000DJUB</classCode><className>US NAVY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CO</classCode><className>NAVIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CO</classCode><className>NAVIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2L8</classCode><className>PACIFIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Highlights are below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Book value per share[1] was $611.00 as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 15.8% from year-end 2018, and a decrease of 0.3% from September 30, 2019. Excluding changes in other comprehensive income primarily related to unrealized appreciation or depreciation of bonds, book value per share increased 10.6% from year-end 2018 and 0.3% from September 30, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $59.39 and $23.77, respectively, compared with earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.62 and $16.13, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.</p><p>* Earnings per diluted share and adjusted losses per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $1.98 and ($6.09), respectively, compared with losses per diluted share and adjusted losses per diluted share of ($48.30) and ($4.35), respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2018.</p><p>* Net earnings attributable to Alleghany stockholders were $858 million and $32 million for the year and three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared with earnings of $40 million and losses of $712 million for the year and three months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.</p><p>* Net premiums written increased 13.9% and 17.6% for the year and three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.</p><p>* Underwriting profit was $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting $400 million of catastrophe losses (most significantly from Typhoon Hagibis and Typhoon Faxai), compared with an underwriting loss of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting $658 million of catastrophe losses (most significantly from Typhoon Jebi, California wildfires and Hurricane Michael).</p><p>* Underwriting loss was $199 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, reflecting $284 million of catastrophe losses, compared with an underwriting loss of $249 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, reflecting $402 million of catastrophe losses.</p><p>* Net investment income increased 9.9% to $550 million and 11.2% to $137 million for the year and three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.</p><p>* Alleghany Capital revenue[2] increased 45.4% to $2,289 million and decreased 5.5% to $563 million for the year and for the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.</p><p>* Alleghany Capital earnings before income taxes and adjusted earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $111 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with earnings before income taxes and adjusted earnings before income taxes of $60 million and $83 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.</p><p>* Alleghany Capital earnings before income taxes and adjusted earnings before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2019 were $10 million and $19 million, respectively, compared with earnings before income taxes and adjusted earnings before income taxes of $36 million and $43 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2018.</p><p>* Alleghany's Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $15.00 per share for shareholders of record on March 5, 2020, payable on March 16, 2020.</p><p>Weston Hicks, President and chief executive officer, commented, \"Alleghany's book value per share grew 15.8% in 2019 due to outstanding investment performance, strong earnings at Alleghany Capital and solid underwriting results at RSUI.</p><p>\"In the fourth quarter, Alleghany's results were negatively impacted by significant catastrophe losses at both TransRe and RSUI, an increase in prior accident year reserves at CapSpecialty, and certain one-time items at Alleghany Capital's largest businesses, all substantially offset by an increase in the value of our equity portfolio.</p><p>\"All three of our (re)insurance businesses delivered double digit premium growth in 2019, which accelerated in the fourth quarter and reflected improving rates, terms and conditions. We believe these market conditions combined with our underwriting talent and strong balance sheet leave us poised for strong, profitable underwriting growth in 2020.</p><p> \"Alleghany Capital produced excellent 2019 results, growing revenue by 45% and adjusted earnings before taxes by 71%. This performance reflects strong underlying results at all seven of its operating companies including organic growth and the addition of several strategic add-on acquisitions. Looking ahead, we expect continued increasing earnings from Alleghany Capital, although growth will be seasonally weighted towards the second half of the year in 2020.\"</p><p>\"Alleghany ended 2019 in a very strong capital and liquidity position and continues to benefit from capital generation at TransRe and RSUI including the receipt of an extraordinary dividend from RSUI in January 2020. Although we believe that maintaining a healthy liquidity position at the parent level is prudent, the cost of holding excess undeployed capital has increased given the current low investment return environment. With these factors in mind, Alleghany's Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $15 per share to supplement the ongoing share repurchase program.\"</p><p>The following table summarizes results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>SEGMENT RESULTS</p><p>The following table summarizes the reinsurance and insurance segment results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>The 2019 fourth quarter underwriting results and earnings were impacted adversely by significant catastrophes at both TransRe (most significantly, Typhoon Hagibis) and RSUI (most significantly, a severe convective storm impacting the Southwestern U.S. and Typhoon Hagibis), as well as an increase in reserves for prior accident years at CapSpecialty. The following table details the impact of these three items on underwriting results and earnings attributable to Alleghany stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2019:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>Reinsurance</p><p>TransRe's net premiums written increased by 15.1% and 13.2% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods. These increases primarily reflect growth in TransRe's domestic operations, which includes the impact of TransRe's August 29, 2018 purchase of the renewal rights to a block of U.S. treaty reinsurance business.</p><p>TransRe's combined ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 114.4%, compared with 120.1% for the 2018 fourth quarter, and was 100.9% for 2019, compared with 105.4% for 2018. The lower combined ratios in the 2019 periods are primarily due to significantly lower, though still material, net catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower favorable prior accident year loss reserve development. Catastrophe losses were $224 million and $301 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared with $304 million and $500 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.</p><p>Insurance</p><p>Insurance segment net premiums written increased by 27.0% and 16.4% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods.</p><p>RSUI's net premiums written increased by 29.3% and 17.9% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods, reflecting growth in most lines of business due to increases in business opportunities, improved general market conditions, and meaningfully higher rates, particularly in the property, directors' and officers' liability and excess casualty lines of business.</p><p>RSUI's combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 104.3%, compared with 122.2% for the fourth quarter of 2018, and was 87.7% for 2019, compared with 94.1% for 2018. The lower combined ratios in the 2019 periods are primarily due to significantly lower net catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower favorable prior accident year loss reserve development. In the fourth quarter of 2019, favorable prior year loss reserve development across several of RSUI's lines of business was largely offset by unfavorable prior year reserve development in RSUI's professional liability line of business.</p><p>CapSpecialty's net premiums written increased by 21.2% and 12.6% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods, primarily reflecting continued growth in the healthcare, professional liability, specialty casualty and surety lines of business due to increases in business opportunities and CapSpecialty's expanded product offerings, and the impact of CapSpecialty's purchase of certain renewal rights in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>CapSpecialty's combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 130.4% compared with 97.4% for the fourth quarter of 2018, and was 108.4% for 2019, compared with 97.7% for 2018. The higher combined ratios for the 2019 periods reflect significant unfavorable prior accident year loss reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2019, most significantly related to professional liability and other casualty lines of business written in recent years.</p><p>In connection with the leadership changes at CapSpecialty in 2019, the company has commenced several new initiatives to restructure its operations with the goal of improving long-term profitability. Consequently, CapSpecialty's premium growth in 2020 may be muted as less profitable lines are reduced.</p><p>Alleghany Capital</p><p>The following table summarizes earnings (losses) before income taxes and adjusted earnings (losses) before income taxes for the Alleghany Capital segment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>The decrease in earnings before income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 from the fourth quarter of 2018 reflects a decrease in earnings in both the non-industrial and industrial operations. The decrease in non-industrial earnings before income taxes primarily reflects lower earnings at Jazwares due to a shorter holiday shopping season, reduced earnings from the Fortnite license, which launched and generated significant earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018, and increased costs due to the acquisition of Wicked Cool Toys, LLC in October 2019, which will only begin to materially contribute to earnings in the second half of 2020. The industrial operations loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with earnings before income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily reflects lower sales and margins at W&amp;W|AFCO Steel largely due to adjustments related to a significant project completed in the 2019 fourth quarter.</p><p>The increase in earnings before income taxes in 2019 from 2018 reflects an increase in earnings in both the non-industrial and industrial operations. The increase in non-industrial earnings before income taxes primarily reflects the impact of higher sales at Jazwares, most significantly due to strong performance of the Fortnite license, and to a lesser extent, the addition of Concord (acquired in October 2018) and organic sales growth at IPS. The increase in industrial earnings before income taxes primarily reflects higher sales and higher margins at W&amp;W|AFCO Steel and, to a lesser extent, higher sales at Kentucky Trailer. Increased sales at W&amp;W|AFCO Steel reflects organic growth and good execution on its backlog entering the year.</p><p>INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE</p><p>Alleghany reported net investment income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 of $137 million and $550 million, respectively, an increase of 11.2% and 9.9%, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods. The increases in net investment income in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 from the corresponding 2018 periods primarily reflect higher interest income, partially offset by lower dividend income. The increases in interest income and the decreases in dividend income primarily relate to a reallocation of a significant portion of Alleghany's investment portfolio from equity securities to debt securities in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Financial statement total return[3] on investments was 1.2% and 9.3% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared with (3.6%) and 0.1%, respectively, for the corresponding 2018 periods. The increases in the 2019 periods reflect significant increases in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio and, with respect to the full year increase only, an increase in unrealized gains on the fixed income portfolio, compared with decreases in the 2018 periods, as well as higher net investment income.</p><p>OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION</p><p>As of December 31, 2019, Alleghany had 14,364,628 shares of its common stock outstanding, compared with 14,576,509 shares of its common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018.</p><p>During the 2019 year, Alleghany repurchased an aggregate of 215,091 shares of its common stock in the open market for $144 million, at an average price per share of $671.44. As of December 31, 2019, Alleghany had $627 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.</p><p>Additional Information</p><p>Concurrent with the issuance of today's earnings press release, Alleghany has posted a financial supplement to its website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.alleghany.com\">www.alleghany.com</url>, containing additional schedules that provide further detail pertaining to Alleghany's financial results.</p><p>Additional information regarding Alleghany's 2019 fourth quarter and full-year financial results, including management's discussion and analysis of Alleghany's financial condition and results of operations, is contained in Alleghany's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2019 (the \"Form 10-K\"), to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on or about the date hereof.

Partially offsetting these losses was net favorable prior year loss reserve development of $3 million.</p><p>- Runoff &amp; Other produced $1 million of underwriting income driven mainly by net favorable prior year loss reserve development.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2019, Sirius Group's combined ratio was 111% compared to 103% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

In addition, 2019 included higher current accident year losses, and net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $92 million.</p><p>- Global A&amp;H produced $42 million of underwriting income, including net service fee income from IMG and Armada of $27 million, and a combined ratio of 97%.</p><p>- Specialty &amp; Casualty produced an underwriting loss of $(51) million and a combined ratio of 114%, driven mainly by higher current accident year losses in Aviation (including $12 million from the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines flight crash) and Casualty. Underwriting results were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $12 million, primarily from the Casualty Reinsurance book.</p><p>- Runoff &amp; Other produced an underwriting (loss) of $(13) million mainly due to operating expenses.</p><p>Investments and Other</p><p>* During the fourth quarter of 2019, the investment portfolio returned 0.4% in original currencies and 0.8% in U.S. Dollars.</p><p>- Total investment result for the fourth quarter of 2019, which includes the sum of net investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) in net income, and change in foreign currency translation on investments recognized through other comprehensive income, was $37 million, compared to $(42) million in 2018, an increase of $79 million.

This evaluates the impact of global natural disaster events to identify trends, manage volatility and enhance resilience.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report reveals that the 409 natural catastrophe events of 2019 resulted in economic losses of USD232 billion - 3 percent below average annual losses for this century, but 20 percent lower than the previous decade. Of that total, private sector and government-sponsored insurance programs covered USD71 billion of the total - six percent above the century average but significantly lower than the record USD157 billion in 2017 and USD100 billion in 2018. This means the protection gap, which is the portion of economic losses not covered by insurance, was 69 percent in 2019 - the fifth-lowest since 2000.</p><p>The 12-months under review witnessed 41 billion-dollar economic loss events, and 12 billion-dollar insured loss events, with the two costliest insurance events, Typhoon Hagibis and Typhoon Faxai, occurring in Japan and causing USD9bn and USD6bn in insured losses respectively, due to each storm tracking through a highly urbanized area. The costliest individual peril was inland flooding, which caused economic losses globally of USD82 billion; preceded by tropical cyclone, at USD68 billion.</p><p>From a climate perspective, 2019 was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures since 1851. Notably, record temperatures of 46.0C were seen in France and 42.6C in Germany, while the January to May period was the wettest on record in the United States, with 15.71 inches (399 millimeters) of rainfall.</p><p>Andy Marcell, CEO of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, commented: \"Following two costly back-to-back years for natural disasters in 2017 and 2018, there were several moderately large catastrophes but strong capitalization has allowed the re/insurance industry to comfortably manage recent losses. However, as socioeconomic patterns further combine with scientific factors such as climate change or extreme weather variability, the potential financial costs at play are only going to increase so building resilience is key.\"</p><p>2010-2019 marked the costliest decade on record with economic damage reaching USD2.98 trillion - some USD1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 and with Asia-Pacific accounting for 44 percent.  Private and public insurance entities paid out USD845 billion during the decade with the U.S. accounting for 55 percent alone.</p><p>Steve Bowen, Director and Meteorologist at Aon's Impact Forecasting team, commented: \"Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils - such as wildfire, flood, and drought - becoming much more costly and impactful. Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas. As the public and private sectors balance an understanding of the science with smart business solutions, this will lead to new advances that lower the physical risk and improve overall awareness.\"</p><p>Other significant regional events during the year included:</p><p>* Wettest 12-month stretch in the contiguous U.S. on record dating to 1895 with river flooding across the Mississippi River watershed causing more than USD20 billion in economic losses</p><p>* Category 5 Hurricane Dorian made multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a 185 mph (295 kph) storm; tying with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane as the strongest landfalling storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean</p><p>* Cyclone Idai in Mozambique caused the most substantial humanitarian crisis killing 1,303 people and destroying more than 300,000 homes with USD2 billion economic losses.</p><p>* Windstorm Eberhard was the lone event in Europe to surpass USD1 billion in insured losses after tracking across Western and Central Europe in March.</p><p>* Globe's deadliest earthquake occurred in Albania on November 26, killing 52 people</p><p>* Monsoon rains led to a combined USD25 billion in flood-related damage in China (USD15 billion) and India (USD10 billion) alone</p><p>* Intense multi-year drought and record-setting spring and summer heat led to conditions able to ignite destructive bushfires in Australia. Some 18.2 million hectares (46 million acres) burned and more than 2,500 homes were destroyed, likely to result in insured losses topping USD1 billion.</p><p>Top 10 Global Economic Loss Events</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://ir.aon.com/about-aon/investor-relations/investor-news/news-release-details/2020/Economic-losses-from-natural-disasters-top-232-billion-in-2019-as-the-costliest-decade-on-record-comes-to-a-close---Aon-catastrophe-report/default.aspx\">https://ir.aon.com/about-aon/investor-relations/investor-news/news-release-details/2020/Economic-losses-from-natural-disasters-top-232-billion-in-2019-as-the-costliest-decade-on-record-comes-to-a-close---Aon-catastrophe-report/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>Access the full report plus watch meteorologist and report author Steve Bowen's short film about the key findings on the interactive microsite: <url normalizedValue=\"https://aon.io/2FOWzrp\">https://aon.io/2FOWzrp</url></p><p>Access current and historical natural catastrophe data, plus event analysis, on Impact Forecasting's Catastrophe Insight website</p><p>About Aon</p><p>Aon plc (NYSE:AON) is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions.

While most flights to and from the airport on Saturday - including India connections - were cancelled, airlines have started resuming the same from Sunday evening.A senior Air India official said: \"We have been told that fuelling facility at Narita has been affected. Japanese authorities told us they can give us fuel at Osaka. </p><p>So we have taken DGCA permission to operate a flight on Delhi-Narita sector Sunday night with extra fuel. On the return sector, this flight will take off from Narita and take a refuelling halt at Osaka from where it will fly to Delhi.\"In the past few days, AI's Delhi-Narita was taking a slightly circuitous route to Tokyo to avoid the typhoon.While AI is the only Indian carrier to fly to Japan, two airlines from there fly to India. A Japan Airlines (JAL) official said Saturday's flight between Delhi and Narita were cancelled. \"We are operating a Delhi-Tokyo flight on Sunday which will operate with some delay,\" said the official.An official of Japanese carrier ANA said: \"Our Narita-Delhi flight landed last Friday (Oct 11). Our Delhi-Narita departure time is 1.25 am and that flight could not take off on Saturday (due to the typhoon). This was delayed by 23 hours and supposed to leave at 12.30 am on Sunday. Its departure had to be further postponed to 7.15 pm on Sunday. So we basically combined loads for both day on this flight.\"The Narita website says, \"Due to the preparation status of aircraft followed by Typhoon Hagibis, most of the flights to/from Narita Airport are being affected, even though the landing restriction of passenger flights has been lifted.\"Air India earlier had Delhi-Hong Kong-Tokyo Narita flight which it recently changed to a direct Delhi-Narita route. ANA flies from Narita to Delhi and Mumbai. It will start service to Chennai from October 27. The ANA website says: \"We sincerely apologize for your inconvenience as a result of cancellation and delays on October 12 and 13 caused by Typhoon Hagibis ... On October 14, normal operation is expected except some delayed flights. Please check the Flight Status for your flight.\"JAL currently has a daily on Delhi-Narita route and will start flights to Bengaluru from next March. Giving information about the typhoon, JAL website said: \"We apologise for any inconvenience caused from the effect of Typhoon Hagibis. As flight restrictions at Tokyo Haneda and Narita airports have been lifted, commercial flights will be progressively resumed. Flight preparations are currently being made... Many flights have been cancelled and delayed due to typhoon Hagibis.\" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOI-71574380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8G-X151-JB3N-T21R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The Company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approximately $11 billion and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.</p><p>The Company's loss estimate is based on its ground-up assessment of losses from individual contracts and treaties exposed to the affected regions, including preliminary information from clients, brokers and loss adjusters. Industry insured loss estimates, market share analyses and catastrophe modeling analyses were also taken into account where appropriate. Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.</p><p>About AXIS Capital</p><p>AXIS Capital, through its operating subsidiaries, is a global provider of specialty lines insurance and treaty reinsurance with shareholders' equity at September 30, 2019 of $5.6 billion and locations in Bermuda, the United States, Europe, Singapore, Canada and the Middle East. Its operating subsidiaries have been assigned a rating of \"A+\" (\"Strong\") by Standard &amp; Poor's and \"A+\" (\"Superior\") by A.M. Best.

This was driven both by Reinsurance (+16.2%) and Specialty Insurance (+14.4%).</p><p>At January renewals, SCOR secures an increase in reinsurance underwriting profitability of circa 1 percentage point, reflecting a 2.8% increase in pricing. Overall, the Reinsurance top line is voluntarily reduced by 4.7% of premiums up for renewal at constant exchange rates. As Reinsurance markets showed limited response to increasing loss trends, SCOR Global P&amp;C took proactive measures to improve expected profitability, focusing mostly on reducing selected large quota share programs.<br/><br/>In Specialty Insurance, SCOR Global P&amp;C witnesses a positive momentum, with rate increases averaging circa 15% for 2019, benefiting from an acceleration throughout the year. This allowed SCOR Global P&amp;C to seize opportunities and to continue its profitable growth trend.<br/><br/>Given the growth rates of the business in 2019 and at January 1, 2020, SCOR Global P&amp;C reiterates its strategic plan assumption of Gross Written Premiums annual growth comprised between 4% and 8% across \"Quantum Leap\".<br/><br/>These January renewals demonstrate SCOR Global P&amp;C's proactive management and responsiveness to market conditions with contrasting strategies between its Reinsurance and Specialty Insurance underwriting platforms over the cycle.<br/><br/>January 2020 P&amp;C Renewals</p><p>The January 2020 renewals show consistent trends with those observed during 2019, with accelerating rate increases on commercial insurance and gradual rate increases on the reinsurance side. A main difference has been an increase in loss trends for which reinsurance price increases only partially compensated. After a record three-year period of natural catastrophes losses, demand for reinsurance remains robust. Nevertheless, pricing gaps persist, as the reinsurance market capacity remains abundant and emerging risks such as climate change and social inflation are still to be fully incorporated into reinsurance prices.<br/><br/>In this context, SCOR has built on its longstanding client relationships to proactively manage the pricing cycle, focusing on business compliant with its profitability targets and risk appetite.</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scor.com/en/media/news-press-releases/scor-proactively-manages-cycle-and-improves-profitability-disciplined\">https://www.scor.com/en/media/news-press-releases/scor-proactively-manages-cycle-and-improves-profitability-disciplined</url>)</p><p>With its Specialty Insurance activity, SCOR is fully benefiting from the more favorable market environment and experienced double-digit rate increases throughout 2019 and confirmed at January 1, 2020. Such an outcome further demonstrates the relevance of SCOR's fully equipped 360 risk-taking platform, as outlined in the \"Quantum Leap\" strategic plan.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the April, June &amp; July renewals, the market is expected to stay firm, with the possibility of further hardening as loss affected contracts come up for renewal. SCOR will rebuild the sustained profitability of its Japanese portfolio based on its long-standing client relationships.  Given its modest US casualty portfolio, SCOR is well positioned to benefit from further market changes arising from upcoming US renewals.<br/><br/>2019 Premium and natural catastrophe update</p><p>For the full year 2019, SCOR Global P&amp;C experienced a strong gross written premiums growth, of 15.8% at current exchange rates, to EUR 7.1bn. This was driven both by Reinsurance (+16.2%) and Specialty Insurance (+14.4%). The growth arises from the strong 2019 successive renewals, and also benefits from the very robust H2 2018 renewals particularly in the US.<br/><br/>SCOR estimates the cost of natural catastrophes in Q4 2019 at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax.<br/><br/>The fourth quarter of 2019 has registered a high severity of natural catastrophe events worldwide, in particular coming from typhoons in Japan. SCOR estimates the cost of Japanese typhoon Hagibis at EUR 227 million after retrocession and before tax based upon cedants' information and assuming an insured market loss in the region of USD 8 billion. Our efficient retro program would allow SCOR to materially dampen the increase in the loss, should Hagibis deviate beyond our current estimate of market loss assumption.<br/><br/>Following an upward market loss revision of Japanese typhoon Faxai and the impact of other events during the fourth quarter, SCOR estimates the cost of Q4 2019 QTD natural catastrophes at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax, and at EUR 665 million after retrocession and before tax for the full year. While remaining within SCOR's risk appetite and thanks to its efficient capital shield policy, SCOR Global P&amp;C expects to record an actual net combined ratio below 100% for full year 2019, including natural catastrophe costs. In 2019, SCOR continues to demonstrate its shock-absorbing capacity and pursues the execution of its strategic plan \"Quantum Leap\" with a very strong solvency position and an unchanged dividend policy.<br/><br/>Jean-Paul Conoscente, CEO of SCOR Global P&amp;C, comments: \"As the reinsurance market did not fully react to loss perspectives as we had initially anticipated, SCOR maintains a disciplined underwriting approach as evidenced during the January 2020 renewals. Despite plentiful reinsurance capacity, persistently low interest rates and upward expected losses, SCOR significantly improves its P&amp;C profitability, while accompanying the growth of its key reinsurance clients.

(\"Argo\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: ARGO) announced today that its results for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be adversely affected by certain loss and expense items, summarized in more detail below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Argo's results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year are clearly unacceptable,\" said Argo Group Interim CEO Kevin Rehnberg. \"The industry is experiencing rising claims severity in several lines of business. We have taken appropriate action to adjust our current and prior accident year loss ratios in response to these conditions and to specific information received in the quarter. We believe the actions taken strengthen our balance sheet and position us for a more profitable future.\"</p><p>\"We are experiencing substantial rate increases across our platform, with strong double-digit gains in International and certain U.S. liability lines. Our capital position remains strong, we are continuing to refine our product strategies and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the specialty commercial insurance marketplace.\"</p><p>Key items affecting the fourth quarter include:</p><p>* Prior accident year losses of approximately $77 million or 18.0 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for the fourth quarter. Reserve increases were related to the Company's London, Bermuda Insurance and European business units within Argo's International Operations, as well as property, professional and liability lines within Argo's U.S. Operations. Prior accident year losses in both segments were the result of new information received in the quarter relating to claims trends across various lines of business, as well as a continued review of International business currently in run-off. Prior year losses also include the conclusion of Argo's annual review of Run-off reserves, which resulted in a $10 million reserve increase.</p><p>* Current accident year losses of approximately $30 million, or an additional 6 points when compared to the third quarter 2019 year-to-date current accident year loss ratio of 59%. The adjustment reflects a change in actuarial estimates based on a more uncertain claims environment and the recalibration of the current year based on prior accident year loss adjustments.</p><p>* Catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums of approximately $3 million, or 0.5 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for the fourth quarter. Catastrophe losses were primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis and were partially offset by a modest reduction to estimated losses for prior quarter events.</p><p>* Additional operating expenses of approximately $12 million or 2.9 points related to costs associated with a reduction in workforce, an allowance for doubtful accounts related to our European business unit, and adjustments to underwriting expenses based on certain costs previously allocated to investment functions and trade capital providers.</p><p>Based on these items discussed above, Argo expects to report an underwriting loss of approximately $114 million for the quarter.</p><p>Additionally, several non-operating charges will be reflected in fourth quarter results:</p><p>* As part of an ongoing strategic review and recent operating results, a goodwill impairment of approximately $16 million related to Argo's European business unit.</p><p>* Expenses of approximately $18 million related to losses and impairments on certain long-lived assets that are held for sale, primarily a corporate aircraft and real estate properties; the cancellation of contracts related to certain sponsorships and marketing services; and to severance costs associated with separation from Argo's former CEO.</p><p>* Other corporate expenses of approximately $8 million, which primarily resulted from costs related to the previously announced independent directors' review of certain governance and compensation matters and Argo's cooperation agreement with Voce Capital.</p><p>Argo Schedules Earnings Release for February 24, 2020</p><p>The company will release fourth quarter 2019 financial results after the close of U.S. financial markets on Monday, February 24, 2020. Company management will conduct an investor conference call starting at 11 a.m. EST on Tuesday, February 25, 2020.</p><p>Instructions for Connecting to the February 25, 2020 Conference Call</p><p>A live webcast of the conference call can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://services.choruscall.com/links/argo200225.html\">https://services.choruscall.com/links/argo200225.html</url>.
