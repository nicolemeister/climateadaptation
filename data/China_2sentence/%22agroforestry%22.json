The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry launched Wednesday urgent plans for drought-prone regions and unveiled a five-year roadmap -- the 2025-2030 Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategy -- outlining 23 measures focused on agriculture. </p><p>Key steps include promoting rainwater harvesting, reusing treated wastewater, shutting down illegal wells, expanding modern irrigation systems, and adopting a basin-based water management model. The plan also calls for boosting research on alternatives to chemical fertilizers, such as organic, organomineral, compost, and green manure options, while promoting the expansion of agroforestry and living windbreak practices. It further aims to protect and sustainably manage ecosystems, increase carbon sink areas, boost greenhouse gas sequestration, and reduce ecosystem-based emissions. The urgency behind these measures stems from an alarming decline in rainfall and water reserves this year. According to the General Directorate of Meteorology, T\u00fcrkiye's average rainfall in July dropped to 9.6 kg per square meter, far below the 1991-2020 average of 15.6 kg and last year's 32.7 kg. Several regions, including the Marmara, Aegean, Western Black Sea, Central Anatolia, and parts of the east and southeast, recorded deficits of more than 80 percent. The Marmara region suffered the steepest shortfall -- 95 percent below normal. \"This is the first time we have experienced such a severe meteorological drought,\" Halim Orta, an academic at Tekirdag Namik Kemal University and a wheat farmer in Thrace, told Xinhua on Thursday. \"Surface and groundwater levels are continuing to decline, intensifying the hydrological drought,\" he said, noting that water storage levels in the Marmara drinking water reservoirs fell below 1 percent in August, reaching critical lows. \"Ultimately, this leads to socioeconomic impacts -- people struggle to find enough water for living and hygiene, while reduced production causes food prices to rise and disrupts accessibility,\" Orta said. Agriculture experts warned the crisis is already cutting deep into harvests. Wheat production is forecast to fall by 15 percent this year, and sunflower yields by half, with canola losses of at least 30 percent. Irfan Donat, an agriculture editor of online news platform Food and Agriculture, said that record temperatures in the southern region have also caused sunburn damage to citrus crops such as lemons, oranges, and mandarins, with Adana province reaching 47.5 degrees Celsius -- the highest in the past 95 years. \"Calling it a disaster year would not be an exaggeration,\" Donat noted.

At the core of this drive is the Green Legacy Initiative (GLI), a homegrown tree-planting campaign launched in 2019 to address climate change, environmental degradation, and food security challenges at home and across the region. Now a central pillar of Ethiopia's development and climate adaptation strategy, the annual campaign kicked off on Thursday, with a broad goal of planting 7.5 billion seedlings during the June-September rainy season, pushing the cumulative total beyond 47.5 billion trees. </p><p>To institutionalize progress, Ethiopia took a landmark step in December 2024 when parliament unanimously ratified a proclamation establishing the Green Legacy Initiative and Degraded Land Rehabilitation Special Fund. The legislation earmarks 0.5 to 1 percent of the federal annual budget for restoring degraded landscapes through forestry and agroforestry, with regional states contributing based on capacity. According to the parliamentary motion, the fund is expected to deliver broad social, economic, and ecological benefits while attracting greater international cooperation. Institutionalizing the GLI has elevated Ethiopia's leadership in environmental restoration, serving as a regional and global example for long-term financing and sustainability of climate initiatives. According to a recent study by the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, the GLI has \"significantly reduced\" soil erosion, once a major threat. Previously, an estimated 1.9 billion tonnes of fertile soil were lost annually. Currently, average losses have dropped to 208 million tonnes thanks to the GLI, helping preserve farmland and prevent siltation in dams, according to data from the ministry. The government credits the GLI with strengthening food security, particularly through the planting of fruit trees that contribute to household income, nutrition, and community resilience. The United Nations (UN) also recognized the GLI's contribution to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, targeting zero hunger, through planting high-value fruit trees that enhance food availability. Ethiopia's GLI also aligns with more global climate goals, including SDG 13, which urges urgent climate action. The UN has praised the initiative's \"immense contribution\" to adaptation efforts and its alignment with the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the African Union's Agenda 2063. The GLI is also inspiring regional action. Nigerian Vice President Kashim Shettima, who joined this year's tree-planting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, hailed it as \"an inclusive, impactful, and visionary model,\" urging African countries to follow Ethiopia's lead. Shettima also called the initiative a practical and inspiring response to the climate crisis, with wide-ranging benefits for land restoration, agricultural productivity, and job creation. Experts and policymakers argue that through the GLI, Ethiopia is demonstrating that large-scale, nationally-led climate action is both achievable and essential for securing a stable future in the Horn of Africa and beyond.

Key partners in the bamboo plantation initiative include the Kenya Forestry Research Institute, the Wildlife Research and Training Institute of Kenya, and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology. Dan Opilio, director of climate change in Busia County, emphasized that expanding bamboo acreage offers a sustainable, nature-based solution to the persistent flooding issues plaguing the Nzoia River basin. \"The bamboo agroforestry project will act as a buffer against flooding, restore biodiversity along Nzoia river basin, and transform livelihoods of local communities through mixed cropping,\" Opilio said. UNEP-IEMP Program Manager Wang Guoqin highlighted the project's potential to regenerate the Nzoia River basin and enhance its resilience to climate-related shocks while curbing biodiversity loss. The project will showcase China's expertise in ecological restoration through bamboo while facilitating skills and technology transfer to foster a vibrant bamboo industry in Keny, said Wang, adding that local farmers and fishermen will receive training on establishing bamboo nurseries, planting, and managing the trees until maturity, which will help stabilize the riverbank ecosystem, sequester carbon, and provide wildlife habitats. Judith Nyunja, a senior scientist from the Wildlife Research and Training Institute, noted that large-scale bamboo cultivation offers a cost-effective and sustainable approach to managing recurrent floods that have exacerbated poverty, displacement, and disease outbreaks in the area.

The 22-year-old, a native of a serene village in northern Kenya, braved the chilly dawn weather to race along the 27.1-km Chinese-built Nairobi Expressway, competing against both local and international long-distance runners. Bundi knew his chances of winning the 21-km half marathon were slim, but the thought of running alongside well-known athletes of long-distance races was irresistible. \"This is my first time to participate in the Nairobi City Marathon,\" Bundi said. </p><p>\"Surprisingly, I finished the race without any major hiccup. I feel energized to run similar ones in the future.\" Themed \"I Love Nairobi-Run the City You Love,\" this year's race attracted over 17,000 elite and amateur runners from more than 70 countries and regions, including more than 13,000 Kenyans and 300 Chinese nationals. Ruth Kemunto, a bubbly amateur runner from the western Kenyan county of Kisii, was in her element after completing the 10-km race, sweating profusely but rehydrating with mineral water. Participating in the annual competitive race has been her personal goal, driven by the quest for physical wellness that many of her peers have ignored in the relentless pursuit of career mobility and financial success. \"Finishing the 10-km race triggered some renewal in my whole mental, physical and emotional realm. Running is fun and therapeutic. I am confident I will compete in the 21-km race next year,\" said Kemunto. Since May 2022, when the inaugural Nairobi City Marathon was held, the subsequent editions have grown in stature, prestige, diversity, and impact on the wider society. The prize money has also been increased, with this year's full marathon winners awarded 3.5 million Kenyan shillings (about 27,100 U.S. dollars), and half marathon winners in both male and female categories taking home 2.5 million Kenyan shillings. In addition, the race elevated the sustainability agenda through partnerships with the United Nations Environment Program, Stockholm Environment Institute, and the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry. Steve Zhao, chief executive officer of Moja Expressway, the operator of the Nairobi Expressway, said the thoroughfare has integrated climate-smart practices to boost urban greening initiatives in the capital. The electronic toll collection system adopted by the Nairobi Expressway has helped reduce carbon emissions while enabling motorists to save time, fuel, and travel costs, Zhao said. He added that Moja Expressway supported the installation of air quality monitors at five stations that acted as key turning points for the four race categories during the Nairobi City Marathon. Park Jun-hee, a South Korean tourist visiting Kenya for the first time, said that taking part in the marathon provided him with a chance to view Nairobi's skyline and its scenic landscape. He was impressed by the modern infrastructure in the Kenyan capital, as well as the warmth and hospitality of the local athletes he competed against. Zhang Dongqiang, who contributed his expertise to the construction of the Nairobi Expressway, said he has participated in all four editions of the Nairobi City Marathon, and always marvels at the transformative impact of Chinese-built infrastructure projects in the capital. \"It makes me happy every time I hear locals say it is a great road,\" Zhang said, adding that he looks forward to stronger cooperation between China and Kenya.

The funding pause forces us to confront an uncomfortable question about conservation in Southeast Asia. After decades of foreign funding, why are our conservation systems still vulnerable to external political decisions? </p><p>A major challenge is that many conservation efforts remain dependent on short-term grants, forcing organisations to continuously seek funding rather than develop lasting solutions. This cycle fosters a project-based approach, where initiatives are fragmented and temporary rather than strategic and enduring. As a result, conservation institutions often struggle to transition from grant-based to sustainable investment models. </p><p>This persistent reliance on short-term grants breeds financial instability and undermines the essence of long-term nature conservation. It cultivates reactive rather than proactive nature conservation, where organisations perpetually scramble to address immediate crises rather than invest in preventive measures. </p><p>This pattern hinders the development of crucial conservation infrastructure, such as long-term monitoring systems, robust <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/asia-opinion/article/3266324/southeast-asias-peatlands-are-crisis-what-can-be-done\">community engagement programmes</url> and the establishment of effective <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/asia-opinion/article/3298225/asia-must-act-avoid-eating-pangolins-out-existence\">law enforcement capacity</url>. </p><p>Furthermore, constant pressure to secure funding can divert resources and attention away from core conservation activities, leading to a dilution of focus and a compromise in effectiveness. </p><p>Another issue is the absence of locally driven financial mechanisms to sustain long-term conservation efforts. While foreign aid has been a key funding source, it has sometimes hindered the development of independent, region-specific financing strategies. Governments are preoccupied with political agendas while businesses focus on their own conservation priorities, leaving local funding scarce. </p><p>The substantial challenge lies in reimagining conservation for sustainability and self-sufficiency. Unlike industries such as agriculture, mining or aquaculture, conservation rarely generates immediate, large-scale economic returns. Governments, the private sector and sometimes even local communities might see conservation as an expense rather than an investment. </p><p>We must embrace financially viable <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3284159/case-eco-friendly-alternative-gdp\">conservation models</url>, particularly for local communities to be sustainable in the long term.

According to news reporting originating in Xining, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Current research primarily focuses on exploring and developing innovative substrates for cultivating , aiming to address substrate shortages and the continuous rise in production costs. This study uses (oak) sawdust (OS) as a control to evaluate the potential of (KP), (seabuckthorn) pruning (HRP), and (goji) pruning (LBP) in the cultivation of by measuring parameters such as mycelium growth, yield, protein, fat, fiber, amino acids, soluble sugars, and organic acids.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research, \"Furthermore, principal component analysis and official script function analysis were used to investigate the influence of the matrix formula ratio on the nutritional values of shiitake mushrooms. Results showed that the average duration to complete stages 2 and 3 of mycelial growth on 10% KP substrates significantly decreased compared to the OS group by 11.0 and 10.7 days, respectively. The weight of mushrooms produced from all agro-forest waste substrates was significantly lower than that of the control group, decreasing by 18.96 to 53.88%. The average mushroom weight for KP groups ranged from 235.37 g/kg to 252.27 g/kg, which was statistically higher than that of the LBP treatments, which ranged from 143.56 g/kg to 165.96 g/kg. However, the protein content in the 10% LBP and 10% HRP groups was significantly higher than that of the control, with increases of 4.69 and 12.89%, respectively, and fiber content also improved, increasing by 3.98 to 12.59%. Furthermore, the content of sweet-tasting amino acids in the 10% KP and 20% KP groups significantly increased compared to the OS group (by 34.86 and 144.92%, respectively). The 30% LBP and 10% KP-10% LBP-10% HRP groups exhibited higher glucose values compared to the OS (increased by 118.71 and 72.26%, respectively). Interestingly, the addition of LBP and KP to the substrates promoted the synthesis of acetic acid in shiitake mushrooms, while this organic acid was not detected in the OS. In summary, shiitake mushrooms cultured in 20% KP, 10% LBP, or 10% KP-10% LBP-10% HRP demonstrated significantly better overall performance. This approach not only reduces operational costs by at least 1,680 RMB but also contributes to environmental sustainability by diverting 2,400 kg of agro-forest waste from landfills. Consequently, the utilization of agroforestry waste serves as an effective strategy not only for environmental protection and cost reduction during mushroom production but also for enhancing the nutritional value of shiitake mushrooms.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This, in turn, helps combat malnutrition and contributes to national food security.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Enhancing yield and quality: research and practice of agro-forest waste for Lentinus edodes (shiitake mushroom) cultivation.

These data include 3,156 records of wild boar activity in natural areas and 576 records of crop damage. We applied a multi-scale MaxEnt model to map the regional distribution of wild boar habitat suitability and crop damage risk in Guizhou Province and focused on the role of habitat suitability in wild boar crop damage from a regional perspective. Wild boar habitat suitability exhibits a divergent pattern, expanding from the central area of Guizhou Province to the eastern, northern, southern, and northwestern regions, with a gradually increasing trend. Suitability of habitat for wild boar was associated with composite topographic index, mean coldest season temperature, isothermality, Shannon diversity index, edge density, and distance to village roads. Similarly, crop damage caused by wild boars in agroforestry areas is mainly concentrated in the northeast, with the risk increasing from west to east. The risk of damage was associated with temperature seasonality, roughness, distance to village roads, precipitation in the warmest quarter, edge density, and contagion index. Furthermore, in agroforestry areas, there is a positive correlation between wild boar habitat suitability and crop damage risk, with Spearman rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5759 to 0.5932. This correlation is not perfectly synchronized on a regional scale. This study indicates that the relationship between habitat suitability and crop damage caused by wild boar in Guizhou Province is primarily influenced by changes in population size rather than the habitat. Consequently, we emphasize the importance of controlling wild boar populations through hunting as a way to effectively reduce the risk of crop damage in agroforestry areas, without neglecting the need for proper habitat management.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Limiting adverse consequences of mining activities requires ecosystem restoration efforts, whose arrangement around mining areas is poorly designed. It is unclear, however, where best to locate ecological projects to enhance ecosystem services cost-effectively.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the China University of Geosciences, \"To answer this question, we conducted an optimized ecological restoration project planning by the Resource Investment Optimization System (RIOS) model to identify the restoration priority areas in the Pingshuo Opencast Coal Mine region in Shanxi Province. This region features notable mining activity, agricultural land use, and urban development. We found that the land use changes were primarily influenced by human activities such as mining and urbanization, as well as ecological interventions from 1986 to 2022, during which the area of industrial and construction land continuously expanded. The RIOS model was configured using input data such as land use, digital elevation models (DEM), and biophysical coefficients. Ecological restoration objectives were selected, including Erosion Control for Drinking Water Quality, Erosion Control for Reservoir Maintenance, Nutrient Retention, and Baseflow. Investment optimization scenario simulations revealed that over 90% of ecological projects in the Pingshuo Opencast Coal Mine are distributed in the low-slope areas (0\u00b0-15\u00b0). Four types of technical reclamation and ecological restoration projects, i.e., agroforestry, grass strips, riparian management, and terracing, exhibit strong preferences for specific locations. Riparian management and agroforestry tend to be distributed on soil dumps; terracing and grass strips tend to be distributed in the upstream agricultural areas of rivers and junctions of watershed gullies and slopes. The model prioritized areas based on ecological restoration goals and stakeholder interests, optimizing locations that would maximize ecological benefits while addressing the objectives. Moreover, depending on the different goals of ecological restoration in the mining area, investment plans that maximize benefits for stakeholders should range between 3 and 6 million dollars. While the restoration strategies in this study were designed for the Pingshuo region, they hold potential for other mining areas with similar biophysical conditions, surrounding ecosystems, and mining scales. The RIOS model adjusts its recommendations based on specific input data, making it adaptable and broadly applicable to other mining area. The results of this study positively contribute to alleviating the conflict between ecosystem protection and socioeconomic development in mining areas, scientifically regulating ecological restoration activities, and enhancing ecosystem services.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our results provide evidence that ecological restoration interventions contribute measurably to restore the degraded ecosystems in the mining areas.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Optimal allocation of technical reclamation and ecological restoration for a cost-effective solution in Pingshuo Opencast Coal Mine area of China.

A retired public works official, Mayobo's farmland is near the river, which originates in Kenya's northwestern highlands and drains into Lake Victoria, Africa's largest freshwater body. Four years ago, Mayobo took a proactive step by planting hundreds of bamboo trees on his farm after learning about the tree's flood-mitigating potential. </p><p>\"I was motivated to venture into bamboo farming after training and research on how it could protect my farm from floods,\" Mayobo told Xinhua in a recent interview. Today, the bamboo trees not only shield his farm from seasonal floods but have also rejuvenated the soil, allowing him to grow crops such as maize, legumes, bananas, and millet. Mayobo is one of many smallholder farmers in western Kenya's flood-prone areas set to benefit from a bamboo agroforestry initiative funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences through its Sino-Africa Joint Research Center. The project is implemented by the United Nations Environment Program's affiliated International Ecosystem Management Partnership (UNEP-IEMP), in collaboration with local partners. Dubbed \"Ecosystem Restoration for Enhancing Livelihoods and Addressing Climate Change: China-Kenya Cooperation on Bamboo Technology Transfer,\" the project promises flood protection, income generation, and improved resilience for local farmers and fishermen. Under this initiative, Mayobo and other farmers have received training on bamboo cultivation, helping them establish nurseries and secure seedlings for replanting in flood-prone zones. Samuel Juma Magoba, an elderly farmer involved in the project, has cultivated bamboo on his one-acre farm and found new income opportunities by selling bamboo for furniture, ornaments, utensils, and compost. He recalled the severe flood damage he witnessed in his youth in his village near the Nzoia River basin -- a devastation that has notably decreased since local farmers started planting bamboo along the riverbanks. According to Dennis Otieno Ochuodho, a senior researcher at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology in Kenya, a project partner, the bamboo agroforestry project offers an effective, nature-based solution to climate-induced flooding. Ochuodho said the project aims to expand research, training, and technology transfer in bamboo farming, restore the degraded Nzoia River basin, and enhance food security through mixed cropping systems. A large-scale bamboo plantation, he added, will protect native species, serve as a carbon sink, and supply raw materials for herbal medicine, supplements, and roofing. Despite her advanced age, Alice Makhulo's passion for cultivating bamboo on her seven-acre farm near a swamp remains undiminished, thanks to the economic and environmental benefits she has reaped from the trees. \"Even my children and grandchildren appreciate the cool breeze from the mature bamboo trees. I have also been selling the bamboo stems to local furniture makers,\" Makhulo said. As part of the China-funded bamboo agroforestry initiative, more than 200 farmers will receive training in sustainable bamboo cultivation, which also includes a 25-hectare demonstration site to showcase ecological restoration through the planting of this iconic tree species. Guoqin Wang, program manager at UNEP-IEMP, emphasized that by stabilizing the Nzoia River banks, the project not only curtails flooding but also enhances local livelihoods by combining food crops with bamboo and creating natural products for sale. Leveraging Chinese bamboo technology and expertise, the initiative aims to regenerate degraded landscapes, conserve water sources, and improve climate resilience for river communities, Wang added. Symprose Anyango, coordinator of Eco Green Kenya, a conservation lobby, noted that communities along the Nzoia River have embraced the project, particularly women, saying that \"bamboo has in particular been of huge benefit to women who suffer most from climate change.

The ambitious plan, themed \"Building Resilient and Sustainable Agri-Food Systems,\" serves as a blueprint for transforming the agriculture sector to achieve food security, sustainable land use, and economic development. </p><p>Speaking at the launch Friday, Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources Mark Cyubahiro Bagabe emphasized the transformative potential of PSTA5, calling it a unique approach to agricultural development. \"PSTA5 is unique because it is centered on agri-food systems-that is the central pivot,\" he said. Bagabe urged Rwanda's youth to play a pivotal role in implementing the plan, highlighting the integration of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. \"When you talk about using technology tools like the Internet of Things and AI to move agriculture forward, I can tell you we are together. I see young people as the pillar of productivity,\" he said. He also stressed the importance of translating the strategy into tangible results. \"We must chip into this strategic plan and ensure this blueprint is translated into actions,\" he added. Bagabe also emphasized that the success of the strategy lies in collective action to ensure resilient, sustainable, and equitable agri-food systems for all. PSTA5 focuses on modernizing agriculture and animal resource production, fostering inclusive markets, and creating jobs within agriculture and food systems. The five-year strategy aims to address pressing challenges such as low productivity, food insecurity, and limited commercialization in the sector while enhancing resilience to climate shocks like droughts and floods. It aligns with national priorities and global frameworks, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). PSTA5 incorporates lessons from its predecessor, PSTA4, which made significant progress in areas such as marshland development, agroforestry, and irrigation infrastructure. Challenges like climate change and limited investment in agriculture, however, persist, necessitating further innovation and funding. The expected impact of PSTA5 is transformative. The plan targets an average annual agricultural growth rate of 6.5 percent, increasing export revenues to 1.54 billion U.S. dollars and creating over 644,000 off-farm jobs in agri-food systems, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources. The strategy also aims to empower 72 percent of women in agriculture and improve food and nutrition security nationwide. With the launch of PSTA5, Rwanda has reaffirmed its commitment to driving inclusive and sustainable agricultural development. Rwanda's agricultural sector remains vital to the country's economy, with about 69 percent of households engaged in farming and around 400,000 people employed in agri-food systems, according to the Fifth Population and Housing Census (2022).

Soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) of cropland topsoil (0 to 40 cm), orchard topsoil (0 to 40 cm), dark loessial subsoil (40 to 80 cm), and loess parent material (80 to 150 cm) were determined using the centrifuge method and water vapor equilibrium method. The van Genuchten model was used to fit SWCCs and then convert volumetric soil water content monitored in field plots to soil water potential. A quantitative analysis was conducted to eval-uate soil water stress in wheat croplands and apple orchards. The model performed well in fitting SWCCs for all tested soils, yielding a robust accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.96). Compared to apple trees, wheat was more threatened by drought. From mid-March to early July, the 0 to 100 cm soil layers of croplands all exhibited high water stress with matric suction pF &gt; 3.98, and unavailable water occurred in the 0 to 20 cm and 0 to 80 cm soil layers in late March to late April and mid-May to mid-July, respectively. Drought threat in apple orchards increased with an increase in tree age. In young orchards (&lt;10 y), high water stress was found only in surface soil layers (0 to 20 cm) in mid-March to late April and late May to early July, which spread to a depth of 70 cm in early June to early July. In mature orchards (10 to 20 y), high water stress was similarly observed in the surface soil layers in mid-March to early May and late May to early July, which extended to the 80 cm depth in late May to early July. In old orchards (&gt;20 y), high water stress initially emerged in the surface soil layers in early April to mid-April and then reached the 70 cm depth in late May to mid-July, whereas unavailable water occurred in the 0 to 60 cm soil layers in mid-June to mid-July. The results indicated that soil water stress zones with low water potential were formed intermittently at different soil depths of apple orchards depending on tree age and growth stage.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"However, compared to wheat croplands, apple orchards were less influenced by drought stress, so that converting croplands to orchards could alleviate drought threats in the Weibei area.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Analysis of Soil Water Potential Characteristics of Wheat Croplands and Apple Orchards In an Agroforestry Ecosystem Based On the Van Genuchten Model.

Our study considered both the quality and quantity of multifunctionality by using an improved incremental thresholds method. Compared to homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes have greater potential to maintain high levels of multifunctionality in terms of both quality and quantity. Moreover, we have conducted an analysis of the peak multifunctionality performance to establish the optimal threshold, with the aim of striking a balance between the quality and quantity of multifunctionality. Specifically, the optimal thresholds for agro-forest landscapes were 60% and 55%, respectively. Our study showed the distinct combinatorial arrangements of functions observed across various thresholds, thereby discerning the potentially dominant function in the landscape. The potential dominant function of agro-forestry landscapes was carbon sequestration, which could significantly contribute to achieving carbon neutrality goals.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These findings are instructive for land managers and policy formulators working to achieve 'win-win' sustainable development.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Multifunctionality Can Be Promoted By Increasing Agriculture-dominated Heterogeneous Landscapes In an Agro-forestry Interlacing Zone In Northeast China.

This prestigious accolade recognises EDC's unwavering commitment to advancing the country's renewable energy sector while championing biodiversity, forest restoration, and climate change mitigation. </p><p><br/><br/>As the largest renewable energy producer in the Philippines, EDC is at the forefront of clean energy transformation. Central to its sustainability efforts is its BINHI programme, launched in 2008 to propagate endangered native tree species, rehabilitate degraded forests, and protect biodiversity. This flagship initiative embodies EDC's long-term vision for ecological restoration and sustainable development. <br/><br/>Empowering Communities through Partnerships <br/><br/>EDC's success stems from its strategic collaborations with local communities, farmers, and organisations. Working with 88 local farmer associations, EDC provides resources and training to manage nurseries, source seedlings, and protect forested areas near its geothermal plants. <br/><br/>One notable initiative is the Baslay Coffee Program in Negros Oriental, which supports former slash-and-burn farmers through sustainable agroforestry. By transitioning to eco-conscious coffee farming, these communities have gained stable livelihoods while safeguarding the environment. Similar programmes in Leyte and North Cotabato replicate this model, demonstrating EDC's scalable approach to community engagement. <br/><br/>Global partnerships, including collaborations with the University of the Philippines Institute of Biology and BGCI's Global Tree Assessment Program, further enhance BINHI's impact on biodiversity conservation. <br/><br/>Leading in Regenerative Development <br/><br/>EDC's sustainability philosophy extends beyond preservation to regenerative development. By restoring ecosystems and ensuring a net-positive environmental impact, EDC sets a benchmark for sustainable business practices. Its renewable energy portfolio\u2014spanning geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar\u2014plays a vital role in decarbonising the Philippines' energy grid, avoiding nearly 6 million tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions annually. EDC's geothermal plants, delivering 24/7 clean energy, are instrumental in reducing fossil fuel reliance. <br/><br/>Complementing its clean energy efforts, EDC's watershed management programmes sequester more carbon than the company emits. In 2023, EDC's forested areas absorbed 1.7 million tonnes of CO\u2082, surpassing its operational emissions of 1.1 million tonnes. <br/><br/>A Vision for a Regenerative Future <br/><br/>Looking ahead, EDC aims to expand its low-carbon energy portfolio to 9,000 MW by 2030, further reducing emissions and restoring ecosystems through BINHI and other initiatives. This vision reinforces EDC's role in driving the Philippines' transition to a regenerative, decarbonised future. <br/><br/>The ACES Green Company of the Year Award reflects EDC's leadership in renewable energy and environmental regeneration. Shanggari B, President of the ACES Awards, states, \"EDC's vision of a regenerative future exemplifies how businesses can thrive while making a profound, positive impact on the planet.\" <br/><br/>Hashtag: #EDC #EnergyDevelopmentCorporation #Philippines #Sustainability #GreenEnergy #ACESAwards2024 #ResponsibleBusiness #SustainableFuture<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.com.ph/\">https://www.energy.com .ph/</url></p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p><p>About Energy Development Corporation</p><p>Energy Development Corporation (EDC) is First Gen Corporation's 100% Renewable Energy (RE) subsidiary with close to 1,500MW total installed capacity that accounts for almost 20% of the Philippine's total installed RE capacity.

The mother of two is an early adopter of conservation agriculture, which promotes soil health through minimal tillage alongside organic methods of controlling crop pests and diseases to boost yield. Ever since she started practicing zero tillage, intercropping and application of compost manure, her one-acre farm has produced enough to feed her family and sell surplus at local markets. \"I have been a farmer for two decades and used to grapple with depressed harvests, but when I embraced conservation agriculture and organic weed and pest control methods, total crop yield shot up,\" Mogambi told Xinhua at her farm on Monday. </p><p>Smallholder farmers in Nakuru County, one of Kenya's breadbaskets, have not been spared the challenges posed by a warming planet, including voracious pests, diseases, market volatility and shrinking arable land. The Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR), through its Initiative on Diversification in East and Southern Africa, has nevertheless assisted these farmers in deploying technologies and innovations that enhance climate resilience, promoting food and nutritional security. In Kenya, the initiative dubbed \"Ukama Ustawi,\" which translates to \"partnership and progress,\" is being implemented in Nakuru and Kenya's eastern counties of Embu and Makueni. Mogambi's farm has served as a demonstration site for various innovative practices, including zero tillage, stripping, intercropping, crop rotation, mulching and agroforestry. Since adopting these climate-smart farming techniques, Mogambi has reported a threefold increase in maize, legume, kale, tuber and fruit harvests, improving both her family's nutrition and income. \"Currently, I am able to harvest 36 bags of maize and 20 tons of silage, and before embracing conservation agriculture, I used to harvest a maximum of seven bags of maize. Now I am proud to say farming is my full-time employer,\" Mogambi said. Boaz Waswa, a soil scientist with the Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), a member of CGIAR, said that indigenous knowledge and innovation are key to boosting the resilience of local smallholder farmers. According to Waswa, these farmers should be empowered to increase crop diversification, zero tillage and the use of organic manure and drip irrigation to boost crop yield and combat hunger, poverty and malnutrition. \"When we diversify crops, households will have more nutritious food and better incomes. We also need to apply agroecological solutions that improve soil health.\" He said that the deployment of these climate-smart innovations has also been gender-inclusive, ensuring that women and youth farmers are empowered to cope with climatic shocks. The \"Ukama Usawa\" initiative, which is being implemented in 12 African countries, including Kenya, has enhanced yield stability at the smallholder level, boosting the fight against rural hunger and poverty, Waswa added. On the southern edge of Nakuru County, where Serah Ndung'us two-acre farm is located, a variety of crops including maize, beans, kales, potatoes and avocado trees create a green foliage that grabs the attention of passersby. The middle-aged farmer is a champion of sustainable practices, including agroforestry, conservation agriculture, intercropping and mulching, that have guaranteed her bumper harvests in any given season. Ndung'u said that smallholder farmers are keen to transition from conventional methods of growing crops that have proved unsustainable. Skills gained through the initiative have enabled her to leverage climate-resilient innovations to boost the production of cereals, legumes, tubers and vegetables. \"Sometimes it can turn very dry in my locality, but through mulching, drip irrigation, and minimum tillage, I am able to retain soil moisture on my farm and grow different crop varieties to maturity,\" Ndung'u said.

A 3-year experiment with two factors, mulch and irrigation, was conducted to investigate the effects of different mulch practices and irrigation levels on the photosynthetic characteristics, growth indices, and interspecific relationships of a fruit tree-crop intercropping system. An apple-soybean intercropping system was selected as the research object, and two mulch types [straw mulch (M1) and plastic mulch (M2)] and four maximum irrigation levels [no irrigation (W0), 55% (W1), 70% (W2), and 85% (W3) field capacity (Fc)] were tested. No mulch together with no irrigation was the control treatment (CK). The results showed that there was no photosynthetic siesta phenomenon in the intercropping system, and the daily variations of the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and transpiration rate (Tr) were unimodal. The mean values for Pn, Tr, and leaf photosynthetic efficiency (PUE) of the apple and soybean under the M2 treatment were generally higher than under the M1 treatment, whereas Tr and PUE increased as the amount of irrigation increased. In 2017-2018, the maximum mean Pn values for both apple and soybean were observed under the M2W2 treatment, whereas in 2019, they were observed under the M2W3 treatment. The Pn, Tr, and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) of soybean correlated positively with the distance from the trees, whereas PUE correlated negatively with it. Mulch and water replenishment increased apple shoot growth and the height, leaf area index, and yield of soybean, especially under plastic mulch.

Soil microorganisms are major regulators of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF).\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Yunnan University, \"Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the effects of vegetation degradation on soil microbial communities and their corresponding multiple ecosystem functions in karst regions. In this study, we selected the vegetation degradation sequences of second natural forest (NF), agroforestry (AS) and cropland (CL) to investigate the diversity of bacterial, fungal and protistan communities, and their hierarchical co-occurrence network, and EMF to explore the relationships between them. Compared to the NF, the carbon cycling index, nitrogen cycling index, soil water regulation power, and the EMF were significantly decreased by 8.2%-50.6%, 48.7%-86.8%, 19.8%-24.5%, and 31.4%-69.5% in the AS and CL, respectively. The development of EMF can be explained by the fungal, protistan and microbial hierarchical b-diversity, as well as the complexity (e.g. degree) of microbial hierarchical interactions during the process of vegetation degradation. Notably, correlations between the abundances of sensitive amplicon sequence variants (sASVs) for different karst vegetation types and EMF varied in distinct network modules, being positive in module 1 and negative in module 2. Moreover, the relative abundance of keystone taxa in fungal and protistan communities provided greater contributions to EMF than the bacterial communities.

In an interview with Xinhua, Mbambo, 41, said she uses about 2 tons of wood per months for cooking and to perform other domestic chores that need energy such as ironing. \"There is no other means at my disposal to cook because I cannot afford to buy electricity cooking gas. So, I have to cut down trees in the forest near where I am renting a one room,\" she added. </p><p>According to Mbambo, she used to use electricity in the past even if she had no means to pay for it because BPC, Botswana's sole power utility, had not switched from post-paid to pre-paid electricity. Pre-paid electricity means a customer can only be allocated electricity according to what one has paid for. The payment is done before the customer has used the electricity, said Mbambo, adding that many are failing to do so. Tiny Moloi is a neighbor to Mbambo and in most cases they go to the forest together in search for firewood \"because like my friend (Mbambo), I cannot afford to buy the pre-paid electricity,\" she said. Moloi said she needs at least 1.5 tons of wood every month in order to meet all her energy needs. She tried to substitute electricity with liquefied gas and illuminated paraffin, but it proved expensive for her. A single unit of electricity costs more than one pula while liquefied gas is valued at more than two pulas, according to a recent survey conducted by the Department of Consumer Affairs, which falls under Botswana's Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry. Mbambo needs 500 pula (about 38 U.S. dollars) per month while Moloi needs 300 pula (about 24 U.S. dollars). Mbambo has five children and Moloi has three. The bigger the family, the higher electricity expense there are. Dumezweni Mthimkhulu, Botswanan Minister of Environment and Tourism, admitted in an interview with Xinhua that residents account 20,000 hectares of deforestation each year in Francistown. \"We are deeply concerned by the alarming rate of deforestation and forest degradation in our country, driven by unsustainable land-use practices, illegal logging, agricultural expansion and infrastructure development,\" he said. Mthimkhulu said this destruction not only threatens biodiversity and ecosystems but also exacerbates climate change, leading to adverse impacts on weather patterns, water cycles, and human health. \"We call upon residents, civil society, and the private sector to prioritize the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of forests,\" said Mthimkhulu. He said Botswana is doing everything within its power to strengthen protected area networks, implementing land-use planning and zoning regulations, promoting agroforestry and sustainable agriculture practices, and supporting community-based forest management initiatives. In addition, Botswana has embarked on promoting clean energy through installation of solar farms with a view of making electricity accessibility cheaper and more convenient to the residents. Under Botswanan law, anyone who cuts down trees and collects other forest products without a license risks arrest and a fine of between 5,000 pula and 500,000 pula (357 U.S. dollars and 35,714 U.S. dollars). But little has been done in terms of enforcing the laws protecting forests because \"it is difficult to enforce a law when the government is the one failing to provide the amenities to its people,\" said Mthimkhulu. According to an analysis by the World Bank, the forestry sector contributes an average of between 4 percent and 19 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) of seven member states in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, including Botswana.

The sharing of tea between the two world leaders was a symbol of the exchanges between civilizations and the values of harmony, respect and friendship that this social ritual implies. This seemingly simple act of sharing tea is something that takes place millions of times every day throughout the world. Tea, after all, is the world's most popular beverage after water. Tea also originated in China and is one of its most significant contributions to human civilization. The tea and context of the setting where the two leaders took their refreshment also celebrated Chinese civilization through music, art and aesthetics. Thus rather than a \"clash of civilizations,\" the act of sharing tea can pave the way for a \"confluence of civilizations\".It doesn't matter if we are state leaders or ordinary folk, when we share tea we are opening ourselves up to the possibility of meaningful dialogue and exchange. This \"civility\" is indeed one of the hallmarks of \"civilization\".</p><p>The Global Civilization Initiative was proposed by President Xi in March 2023. Through this initiative, and the related Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, China is outlining a plan for harmony and cooperation between civilizations.

May 21 is marked by the United Nations as International Tea Day. This is a day set aside to celebrate the tea plant \u2014 Camellia sinensis \u2014 and the people whose livelihoods depend upon it and for everyone else who enjoys this most intoxicating elixir. It is, therefore, very appropriate that we take some time to consider the relationship between tea and civilization.</p><p>With regards to art, literature and philosophy, tea has been a major inspiration for many artists in China and beyond. Lu Yu, a Chinese writer and tea master, completed the Classic of Tea during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Lu Yu's work is considered one of the earliest guides to tea cultivation, preparation and appreciation in Chinese history. The Classic of Tea is the beginning of what we might call a specific \"tea civilization\".</p><p>Later this body of work and the refined practice of tea drinking became the famous Tea Ceremony or chanoyu of Japan. Tea also provided the fuel for creativity of many a great intellect beyond China. For example, Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) is an English writer best known for his influential literary works and his role in compiling one of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language. It is well known that Johnson was a ravenous imbiber of tea. Johnson's fondness for tea is evident in his writings, where he sometimes humorously remarked on the pleasures of tea drinking and the social atmosphere it fostered. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is widely considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. He also made important contributions to what would become International Relations theory. His breakfast is recorded as consisting of \"a cup of tea and a pipe of tobacco\". As a mild stimulant and refreshing beverage, tea has played a positive role in shaping civilizational development and facilitating the exchanges between civilizations.</p><p>Tea and humanity are also entangled in what we can refer to as an ecological civilization. The concept of ecological civilization, also a crucial component of the Global Civilization Initiative, reflects China's commitment to achieving sustainable development while preserving environmental quality and ensuring the well-being of present and future generations in China and beyond. In this regard, the World Heritage listed tea gardens of Jingmaishan in Southwest China's Yunnan province, represent valuable contributions to \"tea civilization\". Part of the value of these groves of ancient tea trees lies in the lessons they can share with the tea industry as it seeks ways to encourage resilient and sustainable tea cultivation practices that will help mitigate the challenge of climate change. These tea gardens represent a form of sustainable tea agroforestry that is the embodiment of the Chinese civilizational ideals of \"harmony between nature and humanity\" (tian ren he yi).</p><p>Thus no matter how we define \"civilization\", either as the development of sophisticated knowledge, technology, art and literature, or more inclusively as those knowledge and practices that contribute to a sensitive and sustainable relationship between humanity and nature, we can see that tea has played a significant role. The Global Civilization Initiative advocates for the equal respect of all human civilizations. Tea as a form of ritualized shared experience is an excellent way for us to find the time to celebrate what we have in common and what makes us distinct. This is, in my view, precisely what President Xi and President Macron experienced when they took tea in Guangzhou in April 2023.</p><p>As we celebrate International Tea Day in 2024, let's take the time express our gratitude for the tea plant and all those who work tirelessly to bring us the daily beverage that is the hallmark of a \"tea civilization\". Tea means \"peace\" and \"harmony\" between humanity and nature and between the diversity of human civilizations and cultures. Think about that when you next hold your cup of tea.

To balance development and security in a coordinative way while considering both domestic and international situations, it is imperative for China to strategize its agricultural supply security for the modernization journey ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This entails adhering to an all-encompassing approach to food, resources, and agriculture, while deepening supply-side structural reforms in the agricultural sector.</p><p>First, it is important to establish a comprehensive support system to sustain the increase of agricultural production capacity. This includes implementing the strictest farmland protection system, bolstering the dynamic monitoring and evaluation of farmland quality, establishing incentive and constraint mechanisms, and enhancing the responsibility of relevant parties in protecting farmland quality. Furthermore, it is important to advance the construction of high-standard farmland, integrate investments across various departments, and promote soil improvement and ecological governance. The potential of arable land resources, coupled with the development of suitable machinery and cultivation techniques, should be further harnessed. It is important to embrace an all-encompassing approach to food, leverage technology to empower the synergized development of agricultural production and ecology, and explore new channels such as agroforestry, deep-sea aquaculture, desert agriculture, and plant factories for bolstering food supply. Additionally, the nation should establish an innovative seed sector and strengthen agricultural disaster-relief technologies and material reserves to enhance climate resilience in the agricultural sector.</p><p>Second, it is important to optimize agricultural subsidy policies to align with farmers' motivation for planting grain and the emphasis from local authorities on grain production. This involves supporting the establishment of a new type of unified management and cooperative operation system, promoting the integration of planting and breeding practices, extending processing chains, and diversifying functions. It also entails enhancing support for new-type agricultural business entities, regulating land transfer behaviors, and stabilizing long-term agricultural investment expectations. Meanwhile, it is also important to target agricultural subsidies in a more precise manner, improve crop insurance systems, increase subsidies for farm machinery, social service procurement, and agricultural inputs, and beef up support for green practices. We also need to strengthen support for major agricultural production areas and promote production-sales integration, while providing warehousing and transportation subsidies for important agricultural products.</p><p>Moreover, China must carry out a diversified import strategy to enhance the stability and reliability of its overseas supply chains.</p><p>First, the nation should stabilize and expand imports of agricultural products from North America and Oceania. The two regions, with superior agricultural resources and high-level modernization, represent an important source of China's key agricultural imports. Agricultural cooperation is also the ballast for trade and economic ties between China and countries in these regions, and thus heightened cooperation serves mutual economic interests.</p><p>Second, it is important for China to address weak links in its agricultural supply chains in South America, which serves as a primary source of the nation's agricultural imports. The region, with immense potential for future growth in agricultural production and exports, holds a crucial position in China's strategy for diversifying agricultural imports. Countries such as Brazil are highly dependent on imports for fertilizers and seeds. For instance, Brazil relies on the international market for 85 percent of its fertilizers, with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers reaching dependency levels of 95.7 percent, 72 percent, and 96.4 percent, respectively. Looking ahead, to enhance the stability and reliability of China's agricultural supply chains in South America, it is essential to support relevant enterprises in establishing coordinated supply chains in the region. The nation should strengthen investment and trade cooperation across the entire agricultural industry chain with countries such as Brazil and Argentina, particularly in fertilizers and seeds.</p><p>Third, the Black Sea and Central Asia should be identified as key regions for diversifying agricultural imports. The Black Sea region, including Russia, and Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, still possess significant potential for agricultural production and trade growth. Chinese businesses should sign long-term agreements in conducting trade and investment cooperation within such regions. They should strive for more exemptions from export restrictions, make their terms of cooperation more specific and enforceable, and increase collaboration in areas such as seed industry and agricultural machinery. Meanwhile, countries in the region should be incentivized to cultivate more crops that are in massive demand in China.</p><p>Fourth, the agricultural investment and trade cooperation with countries in Southeast Asia and Africa must be elevated. Some countries in Southeast Asia and Africa possess favorable agricultural resources, with considerable potential for the production and export growth of edible oil plants, rice, maize, and other agricultural products. Agricultural cooperation with these countries can be prioritized within the framework of strategic partnerships, particularly under the Belt and Road Initiative. Through initiatives such as agricultural infrastructure construction and technical assistance, regional countries will be assisted to enhance the agricultural production capacity, so that they can export their agricultural produce after meeting the demand for domestic consumption. It is important to conduct thorough assessments of the natural ecology and cultural customs in these countries to mitigate potential risks in agricultural investment and trade cooperation.</p><p>In addition, the development of a unified and interconnected national agricultural product market should be advanced. This entails enhancing communication and joint research among various departments, improving the collection and analysis mechanism for market information across entire agricultural industry chains, and enhancing the ability to comprehensively utilize survey data and real-time big data. A unified system for the release of agricultural supply and demand information should be established. Meanwhile, it is imperative to improve the futures trading mechanisms to facilitate effective linkage between agricultural futures and spot markets. The development of rural cooperatives and the encouragement of collaboration between businesses and farmers must be promoted to assist small farmers in utilizing futures tools to mitigate market risks.</p><p>The nation should move forward with the alignment of its agricultural market system with international standards. While China is now among the top nations in terms of agricultural futures trading volume, its futures market still lags behind in terms of internationalization. The internationalization of China's agricultural futures market should be actively advanced by encouraging more foreign businesses to establish a presence in China and more Chinese businesses to go global, aligning trading varieties and rules with international standards, attracting the participation from more foreign enterprises and overseas investors.

The Classic of Tea is the beginning of what we might call a specific \"tea civilization\".</p><p>Later this body of work and the refined practice of tea drinking became the famous Tea Ceremony or chanoyu of Japan. Tea also provided the fuel for creativity of many a great intellect beyond China. For example, Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) is an English writer best known for his influential literary works and his role in compiling one of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language. It is well known that Johnson was a ravenous imbiber of tea. Johnson's fondness for tea is evident in his writings, where he sometimes humorously remarked on the pleasures of tea drinking and the social atmosphere it fostered. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is widely considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. He also made important contributions to what would become International Relations theory. His breakfast is recorded as consisting of \"a cup of tea and a pipe of tobacco\". As a mild stimulant and refreshing beverage, tea has played a positive role in shaping civilizational development and facilitating the exchanges between civilizations.</p><p>Tea and humanity are also entangled in what we can refer to as an ecological civilization. The concept of ecological civilization, also a crucial component of the Global Civilization Initiative, reflects China's commitment to achieving sustainable development while preserving environmental quality and ensuring the well-being of present and future generations in China and beyond. In this regard, the World Heritage listed tea gardens of Jingmaishan in Southwest China's Yunnan province, represent valuable contributions to \"tea civilization\". Part of the value of these groves of ancient tea trees lies in the lessons they can share with the tea industry as it seeks ways to encourage resilient and sustainable tea cultivation practices that will help mitigate the challenge of climate change. These tea gardens represent a form of sustainable tea agroforestry that is the embodiment of the Chinese civilizational ideals of \"harmony between nature and humanity\" (tian ren he yi).</p><p>Thus no matter how we define \"civilization\", either as the development of sophisticated knowledge, technology, art and literature, or more inclusively as those knowledge and practices that contribute to a sensitive and sustainable relationship between humanity and nature, we can see that tea has played a significant role. The Global Civilization Initiative advocates for the equal respect of all human civilizations. Tea as a form of ritualized shared experience is an excellent way for us to find the time to celebrate what we have in common and what makes us distinct. This is, in my view, precisely what President Xi and President Macron experienced when they took tea in Guangzhou in April 2023.</p><p>As we celebrate International Tea Day in 2024, let's take the time express our gratitude for the tea plant and all those who work tirelessly to bring us the daily beverage that is the hallmark of a \"tea civilization\". Tea means \"peace\" and \"harmony\" between humanity and nature and between the diversity of human civilizations and cultures. Think about that when you next hold your cup of tea. Think about the breadth of human experience through tea. Like a tea seed that gives life to a tea tree, from little things big things grow.</p><p>The writer is a professor of human geography in the Faculty of Geographical Science at Beijing Normal University.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["In this regard, the World Heritage listed tea gardens of Jingmaishan in Southwest China's Yunnan province, represent valuable contributions to \"tea civilization\".

He noted that carbon markets have emerged as indispensable tools in the collective efforts to combat climate change and achieve sustainable development, adding that the markets provide economic incentives for companies to reduce their greenhouse emissions by pricing carbon emissions. He disclosed the central bank was currently facilitating the development of the carbon markets and has developed green loan guidelines and expressed happiness that the market has already started positioning itself in terms of capacity building even before the green loans come into effect. The central bank, he said, was also in the process of developing regulatory and supervisory tools to foster sustainable practices in the financial sector which will have wider environmental implications and urged commercial banks to embrace initiatives aimed at greening the financial sector. He further said small and medium enterprises were vital to the country's economic growth but face challenges such as access to finance hence the need to empower them on how to access various financing mechanisms such as carbon markets. Ignatius Mwanza, the chief executive officer of the Zambia Industrial Commercial Bank, said the bank has signed a partnership agreement with Verra, an organization that provides standards for certifying carbon emissions reductions, to facilitate technical capacity building through training programs for carbon market participants in Zambia.

The bank, he added, has also partnered with Rabobank, a Dutch bank, to support smallholder farmers to adopt regenerative agroforestry by connecting them to international carbon markets.

According to news reporting originating from Shenyang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"About two-thirds of global CO2 emissions from the energy and industry sectors are generated in China, accounting for approximately 30% of total global CO2 emissions. These carbon-intensive processes usually produce a large amount of so-called alkaline solid wastes e.g. blast furnace slag (BFS), which have shown great potential to serve as CO2 absorbers.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative, Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Natural Science Foundation, Liaoning Xingliao Talents Project, Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, \"In this regard, the climate impacts of these human activities should be re-evaluated by considering the carbon offsetting effects. While recent studies have been focusing on accelerated carbonation of such 'waste' from a technical perspective, the natural carbonation of these solid residues has not been comprehensively investigated. In this research, combining experimental data, we established an analytical carbon sink accounting model to estimate the CO2 uptake of 7 types of alkaline solid wastes produced in China between 1930 and 2020 using material flow analysis (MFA), life-cycle assessment (LCA), and Monte Carlo methods. The results show that China's alkaline solid wastes from the identified industrial and agroforestry processes in 2020 absorbed 64.27 Mt CO2 (35.91-111.01, 95% CI), offsetting 2.2% of the CO2 emissions from Chinese industrial production. Cumulatively, 1099.51 Mt CO2 had been sequestered by natural carbonation, since 1930. The majority of CO2 uptake is attributed to coal combustion ash (CCA) and biomass ash (BA), which accounted for 35.9% and 26.3% of the total uptake combined respectively. All types of solid wastes exhibited rapidly increasing sequestration from 1930 to 2020 apart from yellow phosphorous slag (YPS) and oil shale ash (OSA), with substantial interannual variability.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our results indicate that the natural carbonation of such 'waste' can reduce the carbon footprint of the corresponding industrial and agroforestry processes, and make the case for further research of their full potential.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Quantitative Analysis of Co2 Uptake By Alkaline Solid Wastes In China.

Ethiopia and Somalia have experienced five failed rainy seasons since late 2020, which have displaced 1.4 million Somalis and killed 3.8 million livestock.</p><p>This period of extreme drought was followed by the El Nino-induced heavy rains and flash flooding that killed hundreds in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia last year, the United Nations said. The deluge swamped more than 1,000 hectares of cropland in Ethiopia and Somalia, challenging the agricultural economies in the two countries where more than 65 percent of the population relies on farming and much of the region's farmland relies on rainfall for irrigation.</p><p>Kilion Nyambuga, a research and planning expert involved in the resettlement of slum dwellers in Kenya, said Africa is responsible for only a fraction of global emissions but is suffering disproportionately from climate change.</p><p>\"The fact that Africa is continuously facing the extreme effects of climate change despite the continent's low emissions is harming food security, ecosystems and economies while fueling displacement, migration and worsening the threat of conflict over dwindling resources,\" he said.</p><p>Emissions of carbon dioxide per person in Africa in 2021 were 1.04 metric tons, standing in stark contrast to the global average, which is more than four times as high, said a report published by the World Meteorological Organization in September.</p><p>The report, called \"State of the Climate in Africa 2022\", said the rate of temperature increase across Africa has accelerated in recent decades, with weather and climate-related hazards becoming more severe. Yet, financing for climate adaptation is a drop in the ocean of what is needed.</p><p>Nyambuga said the global approach, which seems fixated on mitigation, neglects Africa's pressing need for adaptation financing and loss and damage compensation. The decision by African countries to host the inaugural Africa Climate Summit in Kenya's capital Nairobi in September 2023, was timely and \"a plus for the African Union\", he said.</p><p>Alex Mugambi, chair of the Environmental Institute of Kenya, said the African Climate Summit was a success, highlighting the adoption of the Nairobi Declaration, a comprehensive document that outlines Africa's vision, priorities, and demands for climate action and finance.</p><p>\"The declaration call was a win for Africa for calling for a new global financial deal with fit-for-purpose financing instruments and products to serve Africa's specific growth goals,\" Mugambi said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disproportionate financing</emphasis></p><p>\"The declaration also shed light on the disproportionate global climate change financing system by urging developed countries to honor their commitment to provide $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020 and increase their ambition and support for adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer and capacity building in Africa.\"</p><p>Nyambuga said the Africa Climate Summit also drew attention to local African solutions in combating climate change, adding that previous focus on local solutions generated by native communities had been inadequate.</p><p>As global delegates gathered in the United Arab Emirates in November for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, African experts have said the forum produced a range of outcomes that may help to scale up efforts to invest in clean energy, mitigate climate change damage and accelerate the development of carbon markets.</p><p>A key priority for the African continent heading into COP28 was to bring the loss and damage fund into operation, said Hardi Yakubu, movement coordinator of Africans Rising For Unity, Justice, Peace&amp; Dignity, a pan-African civil society movement. This fund was agreed in principle at the previous summit as a vehicle to help low-income countries that are most exposed to climate change impacts, and was featured prominently in the Nairobi Declaration.</p><p>The financial commitments announced by several countries at COP28, with pledges totaling more than $700 million, reflect a glimmer of hope for developing countries, said Yakubu, a climate activist from Ghana.</p><p>\"The first round of pledges will clearly be insufficient to support countries in Africa and around the world on the front line of the climate crisis. However, the success of this fund will depend on the speed and scale at which funds start flowing to people in need,\" he said.</p><p>Another area that received much attention at COP28 was Africa's contribution to the voluntary carbon market, he said. This market provides a route for Africa to financially benefit from its natural resources and assets which remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide other environmental services to the planet.</p><p>\"COP28 achieved good progress toward realizing the win-win opportunities from the carbon markets. Africa is poised to benefit from a maturation of the carbon market over the next 18 months,\" Yakubu said.</p><p>Mugambi said all is not lost for Africa as the continent steps up efforts to make its climate needs known.</p><p>In addition to demanding climate compensation, he said African policymakers can create an enabling environment for green ventures that invest in research, innovation and education, as well as for promoting public-private partnerships and fostering collaboration across governments, businesses and local communities.</p><p>\"Africa should prioritize transitioning to sustainable agriculture, which currently contributes about 17 percent to sub-Saharan Africa's GDP.

In other continents, they said, such development has often been fueled by the utilization of oil and gas resources.</p><p>Exploiting Africa's newly discovered fossil fuels will lead to new jobs and business opportunities, Nyambuga said. In addition, successful exploration on the continent will attract further investment, leading to a rise in employment across many industries and accelerated economic growth for oil-rich African countries.</p><p>\"The global approach should not be fixated on mitigation while ignoring Africa's pressing need for earning revenue through its resources as others did before. The demand for greater consideration of Africa's needs will do nothing if African governments are not pulling in the same direction.

According to news reporting originating in Haikou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Evapotranspiration (ET) in terrestrial ecosystems is of great significance for water resource evaluation, crop water requirements, and drought monitoring and is affected by multiple environmental factors. Several studies investigated the environmental factors affecting evapotranspiration with long time series, but there are few detailed research exploring changes in the dominant controls of ET.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Pan-TPE), Special Fund of Chinese Central Government for Basic Scientific Research Operations in Commonweal Research Institutes, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Natural Science Foundation, United States Department of Energy (DOE), UC Berkeley. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Hainan University, \"It is essential to understand the primary mechanisms involved and their response to climate change. In this study, we analyzed the dominant controls on ET using variable importance in projection (VIP) scores from a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) analysis and then explored the change of dominant controls over time. Our results indicated a significant ET increase trend over 1982-2015 of 1.40 mm/year in China, with solar radiation (SR), temperature (T), and leaf area index (LAI), as the dominant controls contributing to the increasing changes of ET. Increase in LAI (greening) was the primary cause of increasing ET over the 1982-2015 period, especially in temperate monsoon climate regions. In contrast, the VIP scores of SR and T indicated a negative contribution to increasing ET during the 34 years. The differences in the contribution dynamics of dominant controls to ET may result from different sensitivities to canopy resistance in different vegetation types.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research revealed an increasing contribution of greening to terrestrial evapotranspiration in China and improved our understanding of the change of dominant controls over China from 1982 to 2015 and their influence to ET under the changing climate and its impact.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: The Increasing Contribution of Greening To the Terrestrial Evapotranspiration In China.

He added that the effort will also seek to transform people's preference and attitude in wildlife consumption in order to protect public health from related risks. Seng Bunra, senior technical manager at Conservation International, said the use of snares to capture wildlife in forests risks Cambodia's forests becoming empty of wildlife. \"The only way that this can be stopped is if there is no market demand for wildlife,\" he said. \"In the face of the snaring crisis that is decimating Cambodia's wildlife indiscriminately, everyone has a role in ensuring the zero-snaring in protected areas, community forests and other natural habitats with wildlife presence, especially through strengthened legislation, increased law enforcement,\" he added. Seng Teak, World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-Cambodia country director, said putting an end to all forms of wildlife trafficking is vital to saving the treasure troves of wildlife from future extinction. \"Concerted actions are urgently needed to stop the demand for wildlife meat and products through a ban on the purchase, sale, transport and consumption of wildlife,\" he said. The Zero-Snaring Campaign event in Kratie is the fourth in a series of eight events following the first one held in the national capital Phnom Penh in March, the second in the northeastern Stung Treng province in April, and the third in the northwestern Preah Vihear province in May. \"Cambodia is a biodiversity hotspot.

Across all conservation management practices, surface runoff and erosion had respective mean decreases of 67% and 80% compared with controls. Use of cover cropping provided the largest decreases in erosion and surface runoff, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining continuous vegetative cover on soils. Coarse- and medium-textured soils had greater decreases in both erosion and runoff than fine-textured soils. Changes in surface runoff and soil erosion under conservation management were highly correlated with soil organic carbon, aggregation, porosity, infiltration, leaching, and yield, showing that conservation practices help drive important interactions between these different facets of soil health.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study offers the first large-scale comparison of how different conservation agriculture practices reduce surface runoff and soil erosion, and at the same time provides new insight into how these interactions influence the improvement or loss of soil health.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Conservation Management Decreases Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">International Soil and Water Conservation Research</emphasis>, 2022;10(2):188-196. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">International Soil and Water Conservation Research</emphasis> can be contacted at: Keai Publishing Ltd, 16 Donghuangchenggen North St, Beijing, Dongheng District 100717, Peoples R China.<br/> The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from Jinshi Jian, Northwest A&amp;F University, State Key Lab Soil Eros &amp; Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.

The Green Legacy campaign, a personal initiative of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as part of his ambition to recover Ethiopia's lost forests, was launched some four years ago, with an overarching goal of planting 20 billion seedlings in four consecutive years. As the initiative gets traction among Ethiopians from all walks of life, this year's edition of the campaign, which marks the end of the ambitious initiative, started last month under the theme \"Our Legacy for Our Generation.\" One of the ardent participants of the tree planting initiative is Getachew Birhanu, a civil engineer in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. </p><p>Birhanu said he has already planted close to 35 seedlings over the past few weeks alone, together with his wife and two young children. During the course of the recently-started Ethiopian rainy season alone, the ambitious Green Legacy initiative will see the plantation of some six billion tree seedlings throughout the East African country in the coming months. \"As a father of two toddlers, I believe we are truly leaving behind our legacy for our country and the generations to come. This is something we should really be proud of,\" Birhanu told Xinhua one day in early July after he planted seedlings on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, accompanied by his wife and children. Birhanu, who had been actively participating in all the previous tree planting campaigns, said he would continue planting trees even after the end of the four-year national campaign as it would propel Ethiopia's green development efforts. Over the past three years, the East African country has planted more than 18 billion seedlings, according to figures from the Ethiopian government. Experts blame the growing rate of deforestation for the rise in the adverse effects of climate change in Ethiopia as Africa's second most populous nation lost its abundant forest coverage, with worsening trends over the past few decades. According to the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority (EEPA), Ethiopia only contributes to an estimated 0.04 percent of the global greenhouse gas emission, but is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, mainly due to its high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources, as well as its relatively low adaptive capacity. Speaking to Xinhua recently, EEPA director-general Getahun Garedew said the East African country is now facing the brunt of climate change and needs to urgently build climate resilience capability. \"Ethiopia is contributing very little toward climate change but being affected very hugely,\" he said. \"Biodiversity loss is another challenge, which is also a worldwide problem.\" According to Garedew, as the adverse effects of climate change persist, heavy rains, flooding and soil erosion are putting both urban and rural infrastructure at risk, particularly for the vulnerable segment of the population. According to EEPA figures, there has been considerable evidence of climate change impacts in Ethiopia over the last 50 years. At the national level, temperatures have increased by an average of around 1 degree Celsius since the 1960s. Rainfall is subject to high inter-annual and intra-annual variability, in which yearly variation around the mean rainfall level is 25 percent and can increase to 50 percent in some parts of the country. Extreme weather events like droughts and floods have also become more frequent in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian PM, in his message on the launch of this year's campaign, said Ethiopia is gravely affected by climate change-induced challenges and is considered a climate vulnerable country. \"Our immediate and practical approach to addressing climate change is the Green Legacy Initiative,\" Ahmed said, as he called on Ethiopians to make this year's edition of the tree planting initiative a success. According to the Ethiopian government figures, with an annually improving survival rate of around 80 percent of the newly planted seedlings, the initiative is ultimately contributing to the creation of new forest areas across Ethiopia. Of this year's seedlings prepared for planting, agroforestry trees make up about 52 percent and forestry trees account for 47 percent, while the remaining are ornamental trees, according to figures from the Ethiopian government. Billene Seyoum, a press secretary for the Office of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, told journalists recently that one of the key successes of the green legacy initiative has been its instrumental role in mobilizing millions and creating public awareness, eventually leading to a significant decline in the rate of deforestation over the past couple of years. Seyoum also emphasized that the proliferation of more than 120,000 nursery sites throughout the country has enabled job creation for various sections of society.

Named Burj Zanzibar - \"burj\" meaning tower in Arabic - the spectacular high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. Dubbed \"vertical green village\", it would represent an iconic landmark not only for the island but for the whole of Africa and a global environmental milestone, being the first timber structure worldwide of such proportions. The design of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a playful beehive style with breathtaking ocean views, was unveiled to the public in Muscat, Oman on 1 October. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the concept, said: \"Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new ecosystem for the future of living\". </p><p><br/><br/>The residential tower with 266 residences is to be located in Fumba Town, East Africa's pioneering eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm CPS. Categorised as a strategic investment and fully supported by the Zanzibar government, the growing city near the capital, where foreigners are allowed to buy, stretches along a 1.5-kilometre seashore on the southwest coast. \"Burj Zanzibar will be the highlight and natural continuation of our efforts to provide sustainable housing in Africa, thereby empowering local employment and businesses\", elaborated CPS CEO Sebastian Dietzold in Muscat. <br/><br/>With turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and a UNESCO-protected historic Stone Town, Zanzibar recorded 15% annual growth in tourism in recent years and 6.8% economic growth. Earlier this year, the semi-autonomous archipelago, 35 kilometres off the coast of Tanzania, stretched its wings also into another direction, launching an initiative to attract African tech companies with a total worth of six billion dollars. <br/><br/>Benefits of timber <br/><br/>Timber is the oldest building material in the world. As timber technology, it currently enjoys a renaissance because of its environmental benefits and longevity. New timber products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam are considered the building material of the future. One cubic metre of wood binds half a ton of carbon dioxide, whereas conventional concrete construction is responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions. <br/><br/>Once realised, Burj Zanzibar would be the highest timber building in the world and Africa's first high-rise ever in this innovative technology. A few weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). Africa's highest conventional skyscraper is a 385-metre office tower named \"Iconic Tower\" in Egypt, still under construction. <br/><br/>Tanzania's top skyscraper is the 157-metre Ports Authority building in Dar es Salaam. The world's tallest conventional building is Burj Khalifa in Dubai with 828 metres. <br/><br/>Consortium of specialists from New York to Switzerland<br/><br/>Burj Zanzibar is planned as a hybrid timber tower. A steel-reinforced concrete core is designed to meet all required fire and life safety standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and the US. Green roof gardens and planted balconies further reduce the carbon footprint of the building. \"Burj Zanzibar will be a widely visible new landmark for Zanzibar and beyond, not only because of its appearance but because of its construction method\", said architect Leander Moons during the launch event. <br/><br/>Set to promote locally available wood as a building material, Tanzania and its vast land resources for agroforestry would also benefit from the ambitious green mega tower.

Dino Martins, an entomologist and executive director of Mpala Research Center said that insects provide critical ecosystems services hence the need to protect them from harm. </p><p>\"Insects are intrinsically involved in food production besides helping reengineer ecosystems. They are aesthetically appealing and have been part of cultural heritage for many Kenyan communities,\" said Martins. \"Protecting the diversity of insects is now more urgent as threats to their survival mount against a background of chemical intensive farming,\" he added. Martins spoke during a virtual briefing on the state of insects in Kenya organized by advocacy group, Route to Food, which sheds light on emerging threats facing pollinators in the country. He said that Kenya's rich diversity of insect pollinators like bees and butterflies is facing decline amid pollution linked to over-use of pesticides, habitat depletion and changing weather patterns. \"We are losing butterflies and bees as we mechanize agricultural systems,\" said Martins adding that loss of pollinators has disrupted ecosystem services and is detrimental to human health. Faith Toroitich, an entomologist and lecturer at Egerton University said that protecting insects will ensure that Kenyan communities have a steady supply of honey and medicinal products. \"We should protect insects because our survival is heavily dependent on them. They are central to food security and help improve soil fertility through decomposing organic matter,\" said Toroitich. She said that insects have historically provided alternative dietary needs to local communities besides cleaning the environment by hastening decomposition of dead animals and plants. Toroitich said that habitat fragmentation and monoculture has contributed to decline of insect diversity adding that restoration of habitats is key to stemming loss of pollinators. Fathyia Khamis, an Integrated Pest Management expert at Nairobi-based International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) said that Kenya should harness biological methods to restore the population of pollinators. \"Biological control tools like agroforestry, mixed cropping and improved agricultural practices have proved effective in reducing threats to insect pollinators,\" said Khamis. She said that Kenya should leverage on cultural practices of local communities, and improve habitat management and use of natural pesticides in order to combat threats to insects effectively.

LI TIANPING/FOR CHINA DAILY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China's tropical island province of Hainan has joined the ranks of celebrated places of origin for chocolate. World-class master chocolatier Pierre Marcolini played a big role in this transformation by debuting Grand Cru Hainan chocolates at his online flagship shops in June.</p><p>\"This is a fantastic Grand Cru. I feel a slight bitterness, very pleasant, without astringency, with notes of citrus, grapefruit. It is extraordinary,\" said Marcolini. The Belgian chocolate composer spoke via video about his latest bean-to-bar products made with beans grown in Hainan, a place he said he learned about by chance. Grand Cru, meaning \"great growth\" in French, was originally a classifier for fine wines.</p><p>Always on the hunt for new resources in his frequent and far-reaching travels, Marcolini learned about the island in 2017 in the International Journal of Food Properties, a magazine published in the United States. It said Chinese scientists had developed a new variety of cacao in Hainan, a place already known for tropical fruits and economically important plants such as black pepper, vanilla, coffee, pandan, jackfruit, breadfruit, mango, litchi and wax apple. Cacao is the plant that produces seeds from which cocoa and chocolate are made. The seeds are often called cocoa beans.</p><p>Late in 2020, 500 kilograms of cocoa beans were shipped to Brussels, the world's premier city for chocolate, from the Xinglong area of Wanning on the eastern coast of Hainan. The humid island environment, which includes vibrant biodiversity, imparted special qualities to the cocoa beans, including fine quality and special textures and flavors. This captivated Marcolini, who asked his representatives in China to look into the bean.</p><p>\"This is the first time China has exported its locally produced cocoa beans,\" said Qin Xiaowei, deputy director of the Spice and Beverage Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, or CATAS, and lead author of the article that introduced Hainan to Marcolini.</p><p>\"The deal showed that our cocoa quality and production standards have been recognized by the international community,\" Qin said.</p><p>Local reports said that Marcolini has placed two additional orders of Xinglong beans.</p><p>After learning that Hainan is building the world's largest free trade port and has enacted favorable tax-free policies on imports of raw materials and production equipment to encourage investment, Marcolini said he looked forward to visiting Hainan cacao plantations in person, understanding the local culture, and may consider opening a duty-free shop selling chocolates made with Hainan's quality cocoa beans, according to local reports.</p><p>Mark Huestch, a descendent of an eminent family known for their chocolate business in the US, said he was also impressed by the superb quality of the local beans during a recent tour to inspect the planting and fermentation process in Hainan.</p><p>\"Hainan cocoa beans have a very unique flavor, with strong red fruit and nut flavors,\" Huestch said, adding that he would recommend his chocolate products made with Hainan beans to US consumers.</p><p>\"With a growing number of orders flowing in from food producers at home and abroad, Hainan's cocoa production simply cannot meet market demand,\" said Li Fupeng, director of the Cocoa Research Center of CATAS, located at the Xinglong Tropical Botanical Garden, a base for the preservation of tropical and subtropical plants in China.</p><p>While the known cultivation of cacao dates back thousands of years in Latin America, Hainan's cacao growing can be traced only to the 1950s, when returned overseas Chinese brought in seeds and grew them on farms and in the courtyards of their homes in Hainan.</p><p>The cacao cultivation area once reached some 667 hectares around 2004, following large-scale promotion efforts in the 1980s and 1990s. But the acreage dwindled to about 133 hectares mainly due to slack market demand and insufficient processing equipment and technologies, said Li.</p><p>Over the past 60 years, researchers from the Spice and Beverage Research Institute have established a nursery for 500 varieties of cacao, making China an important base in the protection, evaluation and innovative utilization of cacao germplasm resources. A total of 21 new varieties have been developed through systematic breeding and artificial hybridization, boasting high yields, fat content and cold tolerance. The technology and standards for growing cacao in China have reached advanced levels, according to reports from CATAS.</p><p>\"The annual yield of Reyin No 4, China's first cacao variety with independent intellectual property rights, has reached 1,600 kg per hectare, 3.5 times higher than the world average. It has a unique flavor, fine quality and is rich in polyphenols,\" Li said. Polyphenols are compounds that can have health benefits.</p><p>He said, however, that with a limited planting area, Hainan is not in a good position to compete with big cacao growing countries in terms of its cocoa bean industry's output. Hainan should explore an industrial path that is \"small in scale but beautiful and exquisite in quality\".</p><p>Hainan is promoting cultivation of shade tolerant cacao trees in forests of rubber, coconut and areca palm trees, a practice known as \"an economy under the trees\".</p><p>\"While increasing the output per unit of land, we have found that planting cacao trees in coconut forests can play a role in protecting the growth of coconut tree roots, a practice that is not only conducive to building a complex agroforestry ecosystem and maintaining soil fertility but also helpful to farmers in generating more income in one place as well,\" Li said.</p><p>Cultivation of high-quality cacao varieties will create favorable conditions for Hainan to build a superb origin and international brand of high-quality cocoa beans, he added.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["Hainan should explore an industrial path that is \"small in scale but beautiful and exquisite in quality\".

Therefore, sustainable forestry development is actively being promoted and the results are gradually being seen.\" </p><p>Chan's organisation is the first non-profit public charity devoted to combating climate change by using plants for carbon sequestration. In addition, Chan is an adviser to the CFGC Amital Green Fund, established last year as a venture between Hong Kong's Euto Capital Partners and the state-owned China Forestry Group Corporation (CFGC). It supports companies that invest in sustainable and high-yielding afforestation, as well as the development of carbon sinks and related technology. </p><p>China has planted 78 billion trees since 1981, according to state media. As a result, a green wave has expanded across the map. </p><p>Forest coverage reached 23 per cent in 2020, up from 12 per cent in the 1980s, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. China wants to boost forest coverage to 24.1 per cent by 2025, and increase the forest stock to 19 billion cubic metres by 2025, up from 17.56 billion cubic metres in 2020. </p><p>China is \"a very significant restoration story,\" Bronson Griscom, senior director of natural climate solutions at US-based non-profit Conservation International, told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Post</emphasis>. \"But there is certainly a lot more to be done.\" </p><p>The flood-control initiatives are just part of the effort. Afforestation programmes also carry high priority for China in the northern and western regions, where they aim to stem the advancement of the Gobi - merely 1,000 kilometres from Beijing - and other minor deserts. </p><p>Sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi, the world's fifth-largest sandy desert, are an annual nuisance that smothers the Chinese capital almost every spring, turning Beijing into a Mars-like landscape during the worst occurrences. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2177586/chinas-green-great-wall-front-line-its-fight\">Green Great Wall project</url>, launched in 1978 and slated to continue until 2050, aims to plant some 88 million acres of protective forests in a belt nearly 3,000 miles long and as wide as 900 miles in places. The government has added a handful of other major afforestation projects in recent years. It all adds up to what is easily the biggest tree-planting project in human history. </p><p>How much difference do these efforts make for climate-change goals? Globally, nature-based decarbonisation has the potential to deliver one third of the emission reductions needed to meet 2030 climate goals, according to World Resource Institute. </p><p>\"Agriculture, forestry and other land use [Afolu] can provide large emission reductions, and remove and store carbon dioxide at scale,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of United Nations Environment Programme, told reporters during the launch of the IPCC report. </p><p>Under increasing pressure from investors and the public to reduce their carbon footprints, corporations increasingly view afforestation projects as wise investments, because they qualify for carbon credits that offset carbon emissions. </p><p>\"The fact that [mitigation] does have fairly large potentials to both reduce emissions and enhance removals quickly got attention from the business community, which has been keen to increase investments and saw it as a potential avenue for [carbon] offsets,\" said Stephanie Roe, one of lead authors of the IPCC report. </p><p>As a result, mitigation actions could equate to emission reductions of between 8 billion and 14 billion tonnes per year between 2020 and 2050, according to the report. That would make a significant dent in global emissions, which hit 32 billion tonnes in 2020, according to BP estimates. </p><p>The above assumes that carbon credits would be priced near US$100 per tonne. If the price falls to US$20 per tonne, only 30 to 50 per cent of the reduction would be reaped, according to the IPCC. </p><p>Despite all its promise, mitigation has so far delivered only 650 million tonnes of reductions per year between 2010 and 2019 - equivalent to 1.4 per cent of global emissions. </p><p>What's more, only around US$700 million has been spent on Afolu mitigation globally so far - far short of the over US$400 billion per year needed to deliver on the global climate goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the IPCC. </p><p>\"A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies would greatly advance mitigation,\" it said, adding that governments currently spend much more than US$400 billion a year on subsidies to the agriculture and forestry industries. </p><p>Chinese president Xi Jinping stressed the importance of tackling environmental degradation and climate change. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3102761/climate-change-xi-jinping-makes-bold-pledge-china-be-carbon\">September 2020</url>, he set national goals of peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. </p><p>Last August, Xi visited the historic Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm in Hebei province. Established in 1962, the so-called 'green lung of Beijing' is estimated to absorb 747,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and release 545,000 tonnes of oxygen every day. During the trip, Xi reiterated the importance of developing a \"green economy and ecologically friendly civilisation\". </p><p>In the southwestern provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi, and Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces in the northeast, rapid afforestation has seen forest area increase annually by between 40,000 and 440,000 hectares - one-third to four times the size of Hong Kong - over the past decade. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the various activitie that can generate carbon credits? (Jan-Aug, 2021)</emphasis></p><p>Source:\u00a0Source: Ecosystem Marketplace </p><p>State financiers are backing such efforts. China Development Bank said last month it has issued some 114 billion yuan (US$17.7 billion) of loans over the past five years to support the planting and maintenance of about 4 million hectares of forests. </p><p>By the time China achieves its carbon peak in 2030, these forests are expected to absorb 72 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, it said. However, this represents less than 1 per cent of China's annual carbon-dioxide emissions, which totalled almost 10 billion tonnes in 2020, according to BP's tally. </p><p>Complicating the picture, Afolu activity is a big source of emissions as well as a source of potential offsets. The category also encompasses deforestation and substantial methane emissions from livestock and rice farming. Overall, Afolu contributed 22 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019. This puts it below only energy production (33 per cent) and industry (24 per cent), and above transport (15 per cent), according to the IPCC report. </p><p>In addition, afforestation - especially on natural grasslands - can cause additional problems when not done right, said Roe, the IPCC report author, who also serves as global climate and energy lead specialist with global conservation organisation WWF. </p><p>\"Putting trees in ecosystems where they don't belong originally has proven problematic in various types of projects,\" she told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Post</emphasis>. \"In some projects, that has affected the water table as the trees have taken too much water and had to be deforested.\" </p><p>Moreover, even as it increased its forested area, China also imported more timber, offsetting the environmental benefits. In addition to being the world's largest timber importer and exporter of wood products, China is also one of the largest importers of illegal timber and deforestation-linked commodities, said the Environmental Investigation Agency of Washington DC, in a November report. </p><p>Without strengthening mitigation measures, the world is headed for 3.2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which will have catastrophic impacts on humans and the Earth's ecosystems, according to the IPCC. So far warming has already reached 1.1 degrees. </p><p>\"The science is clear, to keep the 1.5 degrees global warming limit of the Paris Agreement within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45 per cent this decade,\" The UN's Guterres said. \"Current climate pledges would mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions.\" </p><p>\"But it does not have to be this way, [there are] viable and financially sound options in every sector that can keep the possibility of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees alive.\" </p><p>New trees are just one instrument in the mitigation toolbox. Looking at the total of 8 billion to 14 billion tonnes of annual carbon-capture the IPCC says mitigation measures are capable of providing, the bulk - between 4.2 billion and 7.4 billion tonnes per year - comes from the conservation, restoration and better management of forests, wetlands and grasslands. </p><p>This is followed by more sustainable crop and livestock management, soil carbon storage and agroforestry (planting of trees in agricultural land), which can contribute 1.8 billion to 4.1 billion tonnes a year of reduction. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2022.

By the 1980s, the village school, lacking students, had closed, and the farmland was abandoned. That is until HSBC partnered with HKU to breathe life back into the village, training residents in innovative farming practices such as agroforestry, a more efficient land-use system. </p><p>\"When we revitalise the farmland, we diversify the habitat so that we have different habitats for different species of animal,\" says Leung. \"So you have more species of frogs and more fish. The whole area becomes more diverse in terms of habitats and biodiversity. It will be a more resilient system than if you just abandon it for a longer time and the whole area turns into forest.\" </p><p>While some fauna species have been naturally drawn to the revitalised village area, others have been carefully reintroduced. HKU's research team found rice fish - which live in rice paddies - in a village a 30-minute walk from Lai Chi Wo, and suspecting that they were part of the ecosystem during the village's heyday, they brought them back, while at the same time removing another, more invasive fish species. </p><p>\"The rice fish are part of the bigger picture,\" says Leung. \"They could be controlling the mosquitoes and could be food for birds and other animals - they are predator and prey. They add more diversity and make the system more complex. In ecology, diversity is our one golden rule.\" </p><p>Environmentalists worldwide warn that the threat to biodiversity is as great a risk to humanity as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>. And while few will have missed the furore around the COP26 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url> summit in Glasgow in November, there was far less awareness of the UN biodiversity summit, COP15, held in Kunming, in China's Yunnan province, a month earlier, where the world's leading independent conservation organisation WWF reported a 68 per cent average decline in global vertebrate populations between 1970 and 2016. </p><p>While that drop is terrifying, one of the challenges of biodiversity - as it was with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url> 20 years ago - is making the issue quantifiable. Thankfully, the world is starting to do that. A report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2019 was the first to put a price tag on the issue, asserting that the world's natural ecosystems provide benefits to humanity estimated to be worth up to US$140 trillion a year. </p><p>And in 2020, a report by reinsurance company Swiss Re estimated that half of the world's GDP depends on high-functioning biodiversity. </p><p>\"Natural ecosystems are humanity's most precious resource,\" says Marine de Bazelaire, group adviser on natural capital at HSBC. \"Protecting them is essential to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Our challenge is to look at the entire economy through the lens of this 'natural capital' and establish it as an asset class in its own right, adapting business models to preserve habitats and creating policies and regulation that prioritise the living world. That's the only way we can continue to benefit from productive land, healthy oceans and clean air.\" </p><p>In May 2021, HSBC teamed up with global research organisation World Resources Institute and WWF to form a five-year philanthropic partnership. Backed by US$100 million of HSBC funding and working with local bodies, the Climate Solutions Partnership aims to scale up nature-based solutions and climate-innovation ventures. It now has 32 projects under way globally and has embarked on a Nature Based Solutions (NBS) Accelerator. </p><p>Working with local teams worldwide, the accelerator, like the Lai Chi Wo programme, aims to help projects grow with connections to funding and a blueprint for replication. In Hong Kong, a good example is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/2176259/wwf-hong-kongs-mission-ensure-visit-mai-po-nature-reserve\">the Mai Po nature reserve</url>: wetlands, including mangroves, are known to sequester carbon and so help mitigate climate change. The Mai Po project is seeking a management strategy to safeguard the carbon sequestration of the wetlands around the nature reserve while also maintaining a diverse habitat for migratory birds. </p><p>Back in Lai Chi Wo, Leung says the project is not simply about conservation - after all, if the village was left for another 100 years it might return to rainforest - but about the whole ecosystem, including how humans can best fit into the picture, living and working in harmony with the land, primarily through sustainable farming. </p><p>\"With HSBC funding we have been able to do a lot of new things,\" says Leung. \"We have capital investment for equipment.\" </p><p>In addition to the obvious revenue stream of selling fresh produce at local farmers' markets, HSBC funding has allowed for the provision of a food-processing kitchen in nearby Sha Tau Kok. Some of the project's produce, such as ginger and winter melon, is sent to the factory for processing. </p><p>\"Traditionally, lots of farmers in Hong Kong do farming, but they are not good at marketing,\" says Leung. \"They focus all their time and energy into the farming itself and then they sell their produce at a relatively low price. I think food processing is the missing link in the farming industry.\" </p><p>Abandoned farmland is an environmental issue because when soils erode, they release greenhouse gases.

Neither she nor her grandfather had ever seen anything like it.<br/><br/>\u201cWe were terrified,\u201d she said.<br/><br/>Cardoso belongs to a cooperative called Coopercuc that grows umbu \u2014 also known as the Brazil plum \u2014 and other native plants to sell their fruit.<br/><br/>When she saw the withered inside of the roots, which she attributed to rising heat combined with a drought the region was then experiencing, she realized the cooperative would need to rethink the way it farmed, with a new goal: reforestation.<br/><br/>\u201cFrom there we started planning... thinking much more about sustainability. Because what is coming, we do not know,\u201d she said.<br/><br/>Now Coopercuc is one of several women-led cooperatives in the area aiming to help increase the number of trees while also providing a livelihood for the people living there.<br/><br/>Climatologist Francis Lacerda said hotter temperatures and creeping desertification are not limited to Uau\u00e1.<br/><br/>Changes across the Caatinga biome \u201care already happening, and much faster than the models suggest\u201d, said Lacerda, a researcher at the Agronomic Institute of Pernambuco, run by the state government.<br/><br/>\u201cThe great droughts of the past lasted three, three-and-a-half years. The consecutive droughts today are lasting seven years,\u201d said Lacerda, also a member of the National Institute of Science and Technology for Climate Change.<br/><br/>According to a 2019 study by the Federal University of Alagoas, in Bahia state alone, 16 percent of land is impacted by desertification.<br/><br/>While studying climate change in semi-arid regions in Brazil\u2019s northeast, Lacerda has seen a sharp drop in rainfall, with an increase in drought days and maximum temperatures.<br/><br/>In some places, precipitation patterns are also becoming more erratic, she added, as areas that used to get three months of rain a year are now going whole years with none or seeing it concentrated into short, intense storms.<br/><br/>In the Sertao do Araripe region of Caatinga, which Lacerda said is rapidly losing forests due to expanding agriculture and cattle farming, she found a temperature increase of nearly 5 degrees Celsius over the last 50 years.<br/><br/>The region used to experience an average of 33 millimeters of evaporation per day.<br/><br/>\u201cBut today we can say that it is at least twice as much,\u201d Lacerda said.<br/><br/>\u201cThe semi-arid (region) is becoming arid \u2014 agriculture has its days numbered here.\u201d Lacerda is sceptical about traditional engineering solutions such as constructing reservoirs to store water, which she said would evaporate quickly.<br/><br/>The answer, she said, lies in reforestation, with a focus on native trees like umbu, which she calls \u201cwater farms.\u201d<br/><br/>By storing water below the soil, the umbu helps fight aridification and soil erosion, she explained.<br/><br/>Knowing this, Coopercuc and other cooperatives across the northeast are combining fruit production with reforestation.<br/><br/>Members of Coopercuc, set up in 2004, grow umbu and other organic fruit trees in backyards that border each other, creating more than 10 small communal farms of one to two hectares each, explained Cardoso.<br/><br/>Since 2019, Coopercuc has been experimenting with \u201cagrocaatinga,\u201d their name for a local form of agroforestry, the practice of planting trees alongside or in between crops.<br/><br/>The cooperative intersperses their fruit trees with native Caatinga cacti and trees such as anjico, Cardoso said.<br/><br/>She estimated that the reforestation areas are already producing about 10 tons of food per year from trees including passion fruit, guava, cashew and mango, as well as up to 40 tons of umbu, which can be used for fruit pulp and jams.<br/><br/>Girlene Almeida Oliveira, a member of the Coopsertao cooperative, which is working in Pintadas in Bahia with support from the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank, said her group grows and processes 30 tons of umbu per year.<br/><br/>A decade ago, Brazilians saw no value in umbu trees and routinely cut them down to make way for pasture, Almeida Oliveira said.<br/><br/>\u201cWhen people saw that the fruit paid off \u2014 that it had a market value \u2014 the interest in reforestation increased,\u201d she said.<br/><br/>\u201cToday, people leave it to regenerate,\u201d she said, adding that, in some places, land which was once cleared for cattle-keeping is now \u201calmost like a forest.\u201d<br/><br/>Even with the efforts by local groups, the Caatinga is still losing its forests, mirroring the high rate of deforestation across Brazil.<br/><br/>Data from MapBiomas, an initiative of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, shows that 58 percent of the biome was covered in natural forests in 2019, a 2-percent drop from 15 years earlier.<br/><br/>This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the reforestation initiatives in Caatinga, with Cardoso estimating Coopercuc\u2019s revenue has fallen 70 percent due to lockdown restrictions.<br/><br/>Coopsertao has been more affected by school closures, as the government is one of its main buyers, said Almeida Oliveira.<br/><br/>\u201cIn 2020, we didn\u2019t sell even 10 percent of what we used to sell,\u201d she noted.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the women plan to carry on. Cardoso, the first in her family to pursue a university education, now has a degree in administration which she paid for with the money she makes farming umbu and other native species.<br/><br/>The cooperative \u201ctransforms the lives of us women,\u201d she said.<br/><br/>Almeida Oliveira highlighted another benefit.<br/><br/>\u201cYou no longer need to wait for the income of your husband (or) son.

(WAHYUDI / AFP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sue Mark spent most of the summer trapped at her home in Western Canada. With major highways closed, she was unable to leave town to escape the smoke, haze and oppressive temperatures from record wildfires caused by an unprecedented heat wave.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The weather has been particularly extreme in many parts of the world this year, with record high temperatures recorded in North America and Europe and, in turn, more intense wildfires than ever before. Huge fires are burning in virtually every continent (except Antarctica) and the impact is enormous.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As July turned into August, the lush forests in the mountains of British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, where the weather is generally temperate, were scorched. The small town of Lytton, in BC, recorded the country's highest-ever temperature: 49.6 C.</p><p>Shortly after, the town was razed by an out-of-control forest fire. The fire was fed by a deep layer of dryness that facilitated its spread. Towns were evacuated\uff0din the case of the town of Lytton, near where Mark lives, in just 15 minutes. Meanwhile, haze was another problem.</p><p>It made it all the way down to Vancouver, 200 kilometers away. The fires continued into last month and are likely to burn further into this month, slowed down only by a delayed rainy season.</p><p>\"People are exhausted because there's kind of been mentally no real break. It's been one worry right after the other,\" Mark said from her home in Kamloops, BC, a larger city deeper into the interior, early last month.</p><p>\"There's been travel restrictions because of the fires. The people haven't been able to escape, so there's been no holidays.</p><p>\"We were breathing smoke for almost eight weeks. It's not smoky anymore. We can finally, for the first time just this last week, we've been able to breathe fresh air and we can see across the valley.\"</p><p>South of the border, huge fires are also burning in the United States. The Caldor Fire in California destroyed more than 81,000 hectares of forests and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands, and, as the summer holiday was ending at the end of August, it rapidly approached Lake Tahoe, which was on alert. The entire Lake Tahoe Basin, a unique landscape, is being changed by the fires.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire, also in California, had grown to more than four times the size of Caldor. By Sept 13, it had grown to more than 388,500 hectares.</p><p>Wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere continued through last month, until rains helped bring them under control.</p><p>Unusually and intensely high temperatures this year also sparked wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Italy. Sicily, in the south of Italy, recorded a temperature of 48.8 C in mid-August.</p><p>Just as those fires began cooling off, the Southern Hemisphere has started lighting up.</p><p>The Amazon rainforest is getting destroyed bit by huge bit every year and the fire season there is just beginning because the seasons are reversed, with summer in the South just beginning as fall and winter begin in the North.</p><p>Last year more than 2,500 fires burned in the BrazilianAmazon alone, more than 41 percent in standing forest, a new trend. So far this year, more than 1,000 large fires have already burned and 2021 appears to be on track to be as bad as last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, Indonesia and Malaysia are beginning to burn as well, with fires generally set intentionally in the peat lands that are cleared off to plant palms for the massive palm oil industry. Also beset by unusually high temperatures, the region lives in fear of a repeat of the devastating 2015 fire season that covered Indonesia, tracts of Malaysia and even Singapore with a layer of haze and smoke.</p><p>In the first quarter of this year, fires flared in 10 provinces in Indonesia but, in an unusual ray of hope, Indonesia is protecting its vast rainforests at a bigger rate than in the last three decades.</p><p>There is virtually no region of the world where wildfires are not a big problem that is getting bigger.</p><p>The United Nations said in a recent report that rising temperatures are increasing the likelihood of \"compound extreme events\".</p><p>Battalion Chief Sergio Mora warns of a potential structural collapse as the Dixie Fire burns through downtown Greenville, California, in August. (JOSH EDELSON / AFP)</p><p>Rising temperatures</p><p>Fires can be more difficult to predict than tropical storms or hurricanes. Instead of playing a role as rejuvenators of forests and savannas, the fires are turning into voracious monsters fed by rising temperatures globally.</p><p>Wholesale burning of the Amazon rainforest is a significant problem for the world. The rainforest accounts for about a quarter of all biodiversity in the world and is a major cog in the \"biogeochemical functioning of the Earth system\", said Ana Luiza Tunes, an environmental engineer and water management specialist in Brazil.</p><p>\"The Amazon is of extreme social importance, not only for the indigenous people who live there but also for all Brazilians. We depend on its humidity, the possible cures for diseases that hide in its forests, its biodiversity and balance and its temperature regulation,\" Tunes said.</p><p>\"The Amazon, and its drier margins, is the scene of intense human pressure on the forest through logging, deforestation and the expansion of the use of fire. The Amazon fire fronts are caused by the criminal actions of land grabbers and land explorers.\"</p><p>The rainforests in the Asia-Pacific region, mostly in Indonesia and Malaysia, are faring better. The government of Indonesia is taking steps to protect the nation's rainforests and fight climate change.</p><p>Experts like Arief Wijaya, climate, forests and ocean senior manager at the Indonesian arm of the World Resources Institute\uff0da global research organization that seeks to promote practical solutions to protect nature and improve people's lives\uff0dsees a direct link between climate change and wildfires in Indonesia. And the same is true everywhere else.</p><p>\"The increase in climate change has resulted in more frequent El Nino conditions, which is a cause of forest fires. Indonesia has seen it happen more in recent years than before 2000. Before that, it used to occur every six or seven years. Now, it comes around every four or five years,\" Wijaya said.</p><p>The worst fire season on record in Indonesia was in 2015, when the fires proved to be catastrophic and led to a regionwide reckoning. Not only did Indonesia move to curb the practice of burning but neighbors Malaysia and Singapore, which are home to the headquarters of most of the companies that rely on burning to clear land, also took policy measures to limit the practice.</p><p>In the Amazon, there is plenty of evidence linking policies and climate change to wildfires, said Brian Enquist, a professor of macroecology and biodiversity at the University of Arizona in the US.</p><p>\"We show that since 2001, drought and forest policy are the best predictors of fire and deforestation impacts on Amazonian biodiversity,\" he said.</p><p>His team analyzed the geographic range of about 15,000 plant and animal species in the Amazon Basin and found that between 2001 and 2015 some 64 percent were affected by fire. Since 2001, the total area affected by deforestation has steadily increased along with a steady rise in the number of species affected by the fire.</p><p>\"At no point since 2001 has it stopped,\" Enquist said. \"As a result, each year habitat for Amazon species has continued to shrink.\"</p><p>Policy responses can make a big difference in slowing the impact of fires and deforestation, or allowing it to get worse, Enquist said.</p><p>\"Although drought is an important driver of total fire-impacted forest area in the Amazon, drought effects on biodiversity loss can likely be significantly mitigated by forest policies,\" Enquist said.</p><p>\"If forest policies aimed at protecting forests are relaxed, we can expect a continued acceleration of habitat loss and increased impact on Amazonian biodiversity.\"</p><p>The good news, he said, is that a shift in policy regulation can have a significant impact, and \"reduce the extent of deforestation, degradation and forest fires there\".</p><p>Devastation from wildfires in Lytton, British Columbia, on Sept 1, 2021. (BURSTON / AFP)</p><p>Economic consequences</p><p>It is difficult to overestimate how broad the impacts of unchecked wildfires can be. Economically, they are devastating.</p><p>\"A World Bank study on the 2015 Indonesian fires estimates the damage to be at $16 billion. The effects are quite wide-ranging as the resulting haze affected even the aviation industry, not to mention the immediate damage to local communities, public health across Southeast Asia and such,\" said Wijaya, from WRI Indonesia.</p><p>In Western Canada, Mark said the tourism industry has been hard hit and the provincial government \"declared another state of emergency, piling on to the state of emergency in place to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic\". The state of emergency in response to the fires was declared on July 20 and ended on Sept 14.</p><p>Ecologically, the fires are tragic.</p><p>\"Since 2001, the impact of fires on biodiversity has continued to increase and has not stopped,\"Enquist said.</p><p>Socially, they are just as damaging.</p><p>Farwiza Farhan, chairperson of the NGO Forest, Nature and Environment of Aceh in Aceh, Indonesia, said the 2015 fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan left an estimated 500,000 children with respiratory issues.</p><p>\"Studies have shown that the cost to local economies amounts to as much as the profits from palm oil exports,\" Farhan said. And that does not consider other less quantifiable factors, such as loss of flora and fauna.</p><p>Things are just as bad in Latin America, where the Amazon burns every year. Perhaps the most noticeable impact there is on nature and biodiversity.</p><p>\"Up to 85 percent of species listed as threatened in the Amazon may have lost a substantial portion of their habitat owing to deforestation and fires in the past two decades,\" said Enquist, the University of Arizona professor.</p><p>\"As fires move closer to the heart of the Amazon Basin, which has greater levels of biodiversity, the impact of fires on biodiversity is expected to increase.\"</p><p>Rob de Laet, project manager at the Plan for a Bioeconomy for the Amazon initiative, said, \"The Amazon, in my opinion, is already in a vicious dieback cycle, which humans can only stop with huge forest protection, reforestation (of old and secondary forest) projects on more than 10 million hectares of deforested land.\"</p><p>What is needed, he said, is a complete halt in clearing land for agriculture and stopping construction of all-weather through roads as well as putting an end to logging.</p><p>\"The new commercial activity should be reforestation and forest protection paid by the world through carbon offset as well as agroforestry and bioeconomy projects,\" De Laet said.</p><p>There is little reason to think that things will get better but, for just about everyone who follows the issue, any real solution will have to be both long term and rooted in policy solutions. The good news is that there are multiple policy responses in most parts of the world to deal with climate change and the fires themselves.</p><p>China is taking very significant steps. President Xi Jinping has committed the country to being carbon neutral by 2060.</p><p>Countries such as Canada and the US are increasingly focusing on reducing their impact on climate change by curbing emissions.</p><p>In Indonesia, both Wijaya and Farhan point to the need to continue implementing policies to deal with the practice of burning to clear land for palm oil estates\uff0da popular way of clearing the land of older trees.</p><p>\"Strong leadership is needed to tackle this issue. Strict law enforcement in recent years has been proven to be effective in curbing the burning. Strong leadership from the national government is also needed as many local leaders are involved with the palm oil companies,\" Wijaya said.</p><p>Farhan said: \"There's no simple solution, but conservation activists need to be embedded in local communities. We need to provide holistic solutions, to give locals a sense of responsibility over their lands and to handle economic pressures.\"</p><p>The question is whether they go far enough.</p><p>Sergio Held in Cajica, Colombia, and David Ho in Hong Kong contributed to this story.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["Rob de Laet, project manager at the Plan for a Bioeconomy for the Amazon initiative, said, \"The Amazon, in my opinion, is already in a vicious dieback cycle, which humans can only stop with huge forest protection, reforestation (of old and secondary forest) projects on more than 10 million hectares of deforested land.

agroforestry (icraf) started a conference here today to mark its accomplishments in the past ten years in introducing agroforestry practice and system to the third world.  the icraf, an autonomous and non-profit world organization with its headquarters in nairobi, was launched in 1977 to initiate, stimulate and support the research for more sustainable and productive land use in developing countries through the integration and better management of forestry.  addressing the opening session this morning, kenyan minister for research, science and technology ndolo ayah urged the governments of developing countries to show \"political will\" to protect trees for better land use and conservation.  he stressed that africa required special assistance in developing agroforestry research as human resources in science and the productive potential of land were fragil on the continent.  according to the latest estimates by the united nations food and agriculture organization, fuelwood and charcoal consumption in africa is more than 360 million cubic meters annually, resulting in a decline of per capita food production by 1.2 percent each year between 1978 and 1985.  addressing the conference this afternoon, director-general of the philippines-based international rice research institute m.s.  swaminathan called for land reforms in third world countries to give farmers ownership of land and formulate regulations to prevent abuse of soil.  chairman of the icraf howard steppler of canada told xinhua that the current global used land is about 1,400 million hectares while 1,000 to 2,000 million more hectares of potential usable land could be tapped.  the two-day conference attended by more than 100 agriculturalists, forestry experts and policy-makers from all over the world, is part of a week-long celebrations of the icraf 10th anniversary.  the icraf, with an annual budget of 4.5 million u.s. dollars, is funded by voluntary contributions from various bilateral,

Trees are providing farmers  with everything from carbon sequestration, to nuts and fruits, to  windbreaks and erosion control, to fuel for heating and timber for  housing.\" </p><p>    Garrity says unless such practices are brought to scale in  farming communities worldwide, \"we will not benefit from the full  value trees can bring to livelihoods and landscapes\". </p><p>    The World Agroforestry Centre is one of 15 centers supported by  the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (  CGIAR). </p><p>    From the data presented in the study, it is not possible in all  cases for the researchers to discern precisely the products and  services that trees are providing. </p><p>    However, a great deal of previous agroforestry research has  documented a wide range of uses for trees on farms, including:  fertilizer trees for improving crop yields and enhancing soil  health; fruit trees for nutrition; fodder trees to feed livestock;  timber and fuelwood trees to provide shelter and energy; medicinal  trees; and trees that provide global commodities such as coffee,  rubber, nuts, gums and resins. </p><p>    As equally important on the service side are uses such as  erosion control, water quality and biodiversity. </p><p>    \"If planted systematically on farms, trees could improve the  resiliency of farmers by providing them with food and income,\"  said Tony Simons, Deputy Director General at the World  Agroforestry Centre. </p><p>    \"For example, when crops and livestock fail, trees often  withstand drought conditions and allow people to hold over until  the next season.\" </p><p>    \"What trees essentially provide to farmers is choice. Choice of  enterprise, choice of market, choice for diversification, choice  for low labour requirement, choice for multiple function,\" Simons  says. </p><p>    \"Developing country farmers are spoilt for choice. Whilst  Western Europe has some 250 native tree species and North America  has a larger set of 600 tree species, the developing tropics has a  staggering 50,000 tree species to manage and utilize.

Impoverished villagers turn to whatever short-term solutions they can find, including the harvesting of valuable local resources. Because many of these resources are not easily replenished, this ultimately leads to deforestation and desertification.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this battle for subsistence, both local villagers and international development organizations are mired in the old ways of doing things, planting seeds that simply will not sprout into a sustainable future.</p><p>But there is hope. Plant varieties once poorly understood by the scientific community are now being developed and tested by Chinese scientists from the Kunming Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with some species showing incredible promise for global poverty alleviation.</p><p>One of the plants is Calotropis, commonly known as milkweed. Native to the Sahel Africa and other semiarid tropics in Asia, Calotropis is a fast-growing and drought-resistant plant that adapts to diverse soil conditions. Naturally suited to grow where other plants fail, Calotropis may globally transform the way we think about ecological restoration in arid and semiarid regions.</p><p>Calotropis is much more than simply a hardy plant that can rejuvenate soil and reduce erosion. Calotropis seeds are coated in a downy fiber that is comparable in smoothness and softness to silk, but is as breathable as cotton.</p><p>As a result, Calotropis fiber has been called the cashmere of the plant kingdom. The fine, silky, durable, and high-quality fibers of Calotropis are beginning to be used in an array of industries.</p><p>With the price of cotton soaring in recent years, there is great potential for the increased marketization of Calotropis, and the multipurpose uses of the fiber are beginning to draw the attention of the industry.</p><p>Its twigs and leaves can be utilized as manure and an organic pest repellent; its stem fibers can be used in bio-composites for construction; its latex contains a stable protease with industrial potential, and its dried latex can act as a potent anti-inflammatory; and after treatment, Calotropis leaves can be used as fodder for livestock. Importantly, Calotropis can bloom and fruit in the same year of planting, and in the third year, outputs reach a high level.</p><p>Because Calotropis is a perennial plant and does not require plowing or sowing, the planting costs are low, making it an ideal crop within poverty alleviation campaigns. And, unlike other cash crops, Calotropis has a short reproductive cycle and is well adapted to salty soils, meaning it can be planted and harvested with a much quicker turnaround.</p><p>The global potential of Calotropis remains untapped. What is required is not only continued research, but transformative initiatives that integrate this research into industry and society.</p><p>The Center for Mountain Futures \u2014 a joint laboratory of the Kunming Institute of Botany and the World Agroforestry Center headquartered in Nairobi \u2014 has been collecting and screening indigenous germplasms to facilitate the improvement of Calotropis varieties with drought-resistance for integration into degraded African landscapes.</p><p>But the Mountain Futures pilot project in Kenya is not simply following old models whereby outside experts come in and dictate the terms of development. Instead, Mountain Futures relies on the insights and expertise of local institutions, as well as local managerial and technical staff.</p><p>The research and development of Calotropis in Kenya has attracted the support of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural resources in Kenya, who believe in the potential of this unique Sino-Africa cooperation project.</p><p>On the basis of field research, the Kunming Institute of Botany will recruit Kenyan PhD students to carry out genetic research on Calotropis, and South Eastern Kenya University has been assigned to carry out the domestic cultivation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Center for Mountain Futures has established a Calotropis cultivation base and suitable planting areas in Africa and Asia. A preliminary study has also been carried out to test the effects of environmental factors on fruit and fiber production, which confirmed the fact that in sub-Saharan countries with wild distribution, the resources are very rich.</p><p>Collaborations like these provide a solid foundation for the further development of Calotropis.

This is no ordinary gathering: Its goal will be to conclude a new policy framework on biodiversity that works for all member states.</p><p><br/><br/>Although the CBD adopted the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, the international community has been decidedly ineffective in achieving them. <br/><br/>The next decade will show that we can no longer treat the destruction of nature as \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d We are quickly approaching environmental and climatic tipping points that could trigger catastrophic feedback loops, making climate change impossible to reverse. A major report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services earlier this year showed that our current activities could lead to the extinction of up to 1 million species in the next few decades.<br/><br/>Given that such losses to biodiversity will jeopardize the future of humankind itself, the time for effective public and private leadership is now \u2014 or never. In developing a framework to align international policies and industrial practices, we should focus on 10 key priorities that belong in any new CBD framework.<br/><br/>First, we must end the global trade in wildlife and endangered species, by making it illegal in both supplier and destination countries. As matters stand, the international community is doing nothing about this issue. <br/><br/>Second, we need a global agreement on how to regulate high-seas industrial fishing, given that industry subsidies are currently contributing to unsustainable overfishing.<br/><br/>Third, we must put an immediate stop to industrial-scale logging and burning of primary forests, be they tropical, boreal, or temperate. Allowing such activities makes no sense. Industrial logging benefits neither governments nor indigenous communities, which should be permitted to farm and log their own lands sustainably.<br/><br/>Fourth, related priority is to ban deforestation across the board. In many countries, deforestation can be conducted legally simply by submitting a request for a change in land use on a given plot. Reaching a world of zero-deforestation commodities will require the support of private companies and consumers who are willing to make a change.<br/><br/>Fifth, we need all governments to adopt a carbon tax, without which we will be effectively promoting a market failure. Currently, we not only subsidize fossil fuels; we also fail to provide ample compensation for the carbon sequestration provided by tropical forests, agroforestry systems, mangroves and wetlands. While carbon prices in voluntary markets averaged US$3 per ton of CO2 equivalent in 2016, the global price should be in the order of US$40 per ton if we are to meet the reduction targets under the 2015 Paris climate accord.<br/><br/>A carbon tax makes sense<br/><br/>Implementing a carbon tax might be politically complicated, but it makes perfect economic sense. Costa Rica introduced a carbon tax in 1997 that now generates US$32 million per year. Those funds are then used to provide environmental services to indigenous communities, farmers and others who plant trees with the intention of increasing biomass in the productive landscape.<br/><br/>Sixth, we should adopt a new financial target for the international community\u2019s biodiversity efforts. We are currently investing a mere 0.08 percent of global GDP in natural conservation. If we can commit to mobilizing 1 percent of global GDP under the new framework, we will have the resources to meet all the other targets we set. Although conservation programs are a domestic matter for national governments, the target should be framed as a multilateral benchmark, given that biodiversity loss is a shared problem.<br/><br/>Seventh, we must stop \u2014 and reverse, if possible \u2014 PADDD (protected area downgrading, downsizing, degazettement) events. In the US and elsewhere, the movement to deregulate protected lands, or to strip them of their protected status entirely, is well-funded and powerful. Obviously, such efforts pose a direct threat to all conservation efforts.<br/><br/>Eighth, we should aim to phase out single-use plastics before the end of next decade, as the accumulation of non-biodegradable plastics is impeding many other conservation efforts. <br/><br/>Ninth, in a similar vein, we need to start thinking about how we can tax pollution of all kinds. In too many cases, polluting is simply free. In the absence of any costs, the problem will only worsen.<br/><br/>Finally, governments urgently need to adopt green national accounting systems. Effective policymaking requires the best available data. Insofar as the current economic system fails to account for biodiversity loss, water pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions, it is part of the problem, not the solution.<br/><br/>Carlos Manuel Rodr\u00edguez is minister of environment and energy of Costa Rica.

But equally important, COP25 offers an opportunity to elevate one of the most powerful tools we have to address climate change: nature.</p><p><br/><br/>Nature-based solutions (also known as natural climate solutions) leverage the world\u2019s forests, grasslands, wetlands, and soils to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Healthy ecosystems absorb and store carbon on their own. And if they are protected, restored, and managed sustainably, they can provide one-third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris climate agreement\u2019s goal for 2030.<br/><br/>In other words, nature is offering us an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. Reducing fossil-fuel emissions is crucial, but it will not be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels. <br/><br/>To secure a livable future on this planet, we also must commit to funding nature-based solutions. <br/><br/>All countries need to start incorporating nature-based solutions into their national climate pledges, and begin investing accordingly. Two years ago, scientists from The Nature Conservancy and its partners published new research showcasing nature-based solutions\u2019 potential to fight climate change. Yet natural climate solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention \u2014 and even less funding.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this may be starting to change. In September, nature-based solutions featured prominently at UN Climate Week in New York City. Although that event did not live up to UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019s call for \u201cclear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020,\u201d it did offer a platform to a new generation of climate and nature advocates. From the Youth4Nature coalition to the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, young people were on hand to demand that today\u2019s leaders account for the challenges they will inherit.<br/><br/>Climate Week also produced an announcement from a coalition led by China and New Zealand, focused on encouraging nature-based solutions in both national climate plans and the corporate sector. And the private sector itself has made new commitments, with a group of 230 international investors (representing US$16.2 trillion in assets under management) calling on companies to take immediate action to address deforestation in their supply chains.<br/><br/>Political leaders now must maintain this momentum, by taking a closer look at what nature can do to help mitigate and build resilience to climate change. For example, one promising solution is sustainable agroforestry, in which food crops are grown alongside native trees. <br/><br/>Nurture critical wildlife<br/><br/>Expanding this practice can bolster food security and boost incomes in rural communities and simultaneously restore soil health, sequester carbon, and nurture critical wildlife.<br/><br/>Another nature-based solution is being pioneered in Australia, where massive bushfires are putting people and wildlife at risk \u2014 and releasing enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The Nature Conservancy is cooperating with Indigenous communities to improve grassland health, sequester carbon, and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Drawing on traditional knowledge dating back thousands of years, Indigenous rangers set smaller, controlled burns to prevent the buildup of dry grass that contributes to larger, hotter wildfires. This program contributes to healthier grasslands while generating income for Indigenous communities through the sale of carbon credits.<br/><br/>These kinds of programs benefit people and the environment; but much more investment is urgently needed. Although natural systems play a critical role in regulating the climate, nature-based solutions still receive under 4 percent of total public funding for climate action. <br/><br/>Worse, natural systems that could be part of the solution to climate change are facing increasingly severe threats. <br/><br/>We have all seen the recent images of fires raging through the Amazon rainforest, which plays a major role in regulating the world\u2019s climate. Record-high temperatures, environmental crimes, weak oversight, ineffective firefighting, and other factors have increased the vulnerability of systems that store a disproportionate share of the planet\u2019s carbon.<br/><br/> And the Amazon is just one example. The conversion and degradation of natural land and marine habitats is ongoing around the world. Such practices undermine our ability to adapt to climate effects like rising sea levels, and directly threaten our food security by wiping out species that pollinate crops, contribute to soil health, and provide habitats for fish and other marine life. Nature, climate, and human wellbeing are intimately connected; none can be addressed in isolation.<br/><br/>COP25 offers an opportunity for world leaders to seize on these connections in the run-up to 2020, which will be a veritable \u201cenvironmental super year.\u201d In addition to finalizing an international high-seas treaty and establishing a new framework for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, governments will also revisit their climate commitments at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.<br/><br/>But any commitments that countries make at these meetings will mean little without concrete plans to back them up. We have the science, and we have the solutions. What we need now is action to leverage the power of nature. Our shared existence on this planet depends on it.<br/><br/>Sally Jewell is Interim CEO of The Nature Conservancy.

countries achieved their political independence after world war two and since then they have paid too much attention to cash crops such as coffee, cocoa and palm oil, resulting in food shortage at present.  the small family farm, the conference pointed out, appears to be the most promising approach to address the food crisis because it not only promises to improve dietary conditions of the families themselves, but also has high job-creating potential.  to ensure the small-scale farming strategy a success, the conference called on the member countries to promote cooperation among small-scale farmers by help forming more small farmers' associations.  such an association, the conference believed, can help small farmers to overcome physical, knowledge and psychological barriers as banks and finance corporations prefer to provide soft loans to organized farmers.  small farmers can thus use their associations to pass more information on agriculture and exchange their experience on greater production,the participants agreed.  they shared the view that without an association, small farmers will be detered from approaching credit institutions for the expansion of

of 700mm, is the field station of the nairobibased international council for research in agroforestry (icraf), which is now celebrating its 10th anniversary this week.  in a trip to the field station, 70 kilometers southeast of nairobi today, more than 100 agronomists, forestry experts, policy-makers and journalists from all over the world were shown the trees called \"multipurpose trees.\"

foodstuffs while protecting and even enriching the local environment.  we were told that the multipurpose trees, selected from as favh lzile and china, could bring in greater benefits, including increased yield, sustained soil fertility, soil conservation and increased fodder and fuelwood supply.  guava, for instance, is intercropped with kale, green pepper and potatoes. the guava keeps water in soil to be absorbed by the crops, while providing shadows for its neighboring crops which don't like much sunlight.  maize, the staple food for africans was planted in alleys formed by cassia and leucaena leucocephala.  as the maize has been harvested, the hedgerows of trees remained there alone. mr. kurira told the visitors that they were planning to plant maize during the coming rainy season in october.  it was said that maize, intercropped with trees cut to 60cm height, can increase its yield by 16 percent. beside the benefit of providing mulch and controlling weed, the leucaena leucocephala can be used for fodder, fuelwood, soil conservation and refores-tation. it can produce 283 tons of fresh green mulch per hectare annually.  asked why the station does not use irrigation methods to get more crops of maize in view of the suitable climate, mr. kurira told xinhua that serving as a testing and demonstrating site for developing countries, especially african countries, the

of the Ministry of Agriculture, the group plans to generate 34 million U.S. dollars through the export of its leading products.</p><p>\"Our plan this year is to exceed the 30 million dollars the group exported in 2017 and continue helping the Cuban economy reduce imports by manufacturing goods here with our own resources,\" said Arturo Forteza, GAF's first vice president, at a recent press

of over 13 billion dollars.</p><p>In May this year, subtropical storm Alberto brought another blow to the island nation, causing heavy rains and floods which seriously damaged the agricultural sector.</p><p>Forteza explained that beekeeping and the products derived from it, like honey, wax and royal jelly, generate the most income to the group, with an average of 28 million dollars in exports each year.</p><p>These sound returns are the reason that investments are heavily concentrated on the industry, specifically in the installation of honey processing plants and smaller product packaging.</p><p>\"We seek to create added value for our beekeeping industry that goes beyond the production of honey.

In the case of honey, the price is above 4,000 dollars per ton,\" De la Cruz said.</p><p>Cuba currently exports its honey in large formats to various markets in Europe.</p><p>Lazaro Garcia, director of honey producer Apicuba, explained that each year Cuba produces about 8,000 tons of honey, of which around 95 percent is destined for exports.</p><p>The producer's intention, according to Garcia, is to have a total of 220,000 hives, increasing production in the near future to 15,000 tons of honey annually. If current prices are maintained, the honey production could generate 61 million dollars.</p><p>Another promising product of the group is charcoal, with exports of more than 28,000 tons, mostly sent to Europe, particularly Turkey, Greece, Spain and Italy.</p><p>De la Cruz said that currently seven state companies are producing charcoal, which is expected to reach 130,000 tons for export this year.</p><p>These favorable results came from the diversification of charcoal production from highly valued hardwoods and African marabou which is abundant in Cuba.</p><p>Increasing coffee production on the island is another objective of the agricultural group, which is expected to grow substantially.</p><p>According to Forteza, the group is collaborating with Vietnam to develop high-quality coffee after last year's all-time low production rate because of storms.</p><p>\"We want to develop our own high-quality Arabica coffee in Vietnam and their robust coffee here in Cuba.
