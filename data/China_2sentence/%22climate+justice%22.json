The court's non-binding ruling, which says that countries must comply with climate treaties, has been hailed as a great victory for youth activism from small island nations facing the brunt of the climate crisis. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The triumph at the ICJ is the culmination of a unique university project started by a group of law students at the University of the South Pacific's law school in Vanuatu in 2019. Their lecturer set up an extracurricular activity, for which 27 students volunteered, to discuss the most productive legal actions Pacific Island countries could take under international law and design a plan of action for their governments. </p><p>The students embarked on a campaign, eventually forming the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, determined to hold polluting nations accountable so they and their children would have a home to live in. They wanted to test whether international law could save them from the impacts of climate change. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Undeterred by the lack of traction, the student group was eventually joined by the World's Youth for Climate Justice, which helped the campaign go global. </p><p>Thanks to this campaign, in March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution supported by over 130 countries requesting that the ICJ give an advisory opinion that clarifies the obligations of countries under international law in respect of climate change. The ICJ has handed down a ruling that vindicates the efforts of young activists from the Pacific region and around the world. </p><p>Sera Sefeti, a University of the South Pacific journalism graduate who reported on the issue for Pasifika TV from The Hague, said climate change is \"a violation of our rights, our cultures and our very existence\". She added that the ruling exceeded the expectations of many Pacific youth. </p><p>Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change and a Fijian politics and law graduate from the University of the South Pacific, said, \"For Small Island States, communities in the Pacific, young people and future generations, this opinion is a lifeline and an opportunity to protect what we hold dear and love.\" </p><p>This moment marks the first time that the ICJ - also known as the World Court - has ruled on the climate crisis.

The ruling may be a boost for countries in the Global South, led in some respects by China, which have emphasised the importance of development rights as human rights. While China is a member of the ICJ, it has yet to accept the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction. </p><p>This ruling comes amid decades of frustration among developing countries that are suffering environmental disasters induced by climate change.

For example, Australia has refused to end coal exports despite pledging to reach <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3155373/how-australias-weak-climate-change-plan-driven-domestic-political\">net-zero emissions by 2050</url>.

However, the question remains: How will such damages be assessed? </p><p>During the evidence sessions in December 2024, the Marshall Islands highlighted that the costs for it to adapt to climate change will be US$9 billion. Countries could also be sued for subsidising the fossil fuel industry or approving new oil and gas licences. </p><p>Whether the ICJ opinion will be respected remains open to question. The court is subject to geopolitics and lacks a \"police force\" to implement its rulings. For example, the United States will officially withdraw from the Paris Agreement in January 2026.

On social media, mourning war's victims is both common and curiously performative; yet we must not deny the horrifying ease with which violence has become background noise for our coffee breaks.

In Gaza today, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3319992/gaza-worst-case-scenario-famine-food-crisis-experts-warn\">starvation is weaponised</url>. Children are orphaned and forced to breathe toxic smoke from burning oil refineries; farmers till land riddled with depleted uranium; generations are condemned to water poisoned by munitions and chemicals. War is not a finite event. Its devastation ripples on, bringing slow-motion environmental ruin that haunts communities long after the guns fall silent. </p><p>Tragically, contemporary climate debates are reduced to corporate slogans, \"net zero\" fairy tales and performative guilt over individual carbon footprints. Western leaders feign concern for islands at risk of submersion even as they ignore the military-industrial complex's colossal environmental and climate damage. The machines of destruction roll on, enriching the merchants of death with every bomb manufactured, sold and detonated. </p><p>The global war industry profits directly as innocents pay the ultimate price, the environment is devastated and future generations inherit a toxic world. The systematic exclusion of military emissions from \"environmental, social and governance\" (ESG) reporting is not mere negligence; it is deliberate complicity, orchestrated by powerful capital market actors closely linked to the war industry. The public is kept in the dark. This is not just a blind spot; it is a calculated deception. </p><p>Let's not pretend the ESG industry is a reluctant accomplice. It is designed to distract from the war industry's role, obsessing over the impact of coffee cups while ignoring militaries' unchecked consumption of fossil fuels and the destruction of cities. The greatest climate criminals wear suits, not uniforms, yet no UN summit dares challenge them. </p><p>A few weeks ago the Global Institute for Tomorrow hosted a groundbreaking virtual conference, \"The War on Climate: Unveiling the Uncounted Costs of Conflict\", exposing the deliberate exclusion of conflict emissions by the military-industrial complex, often aided by governments too captive to resist. </p><p>As nations ramp up military budgets, it becomes clear that the world is preparing not for peace, but for more conflict, in a damning indictment of systemic failures and warped priorities. Rare moments of global cooperation, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/389407/what-kyoto-protocol\">the Kyoto Protocol</url>, have been undermined by cynical loopholes. The US insisted on exempting military emissions from the agreement. Thus, one of the most carbon-intensive activities on Earth was given a free pass. </p><p>The result? Emissions continue to rise, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3320801/record-heat-grips-japan-turns-vietnam-pan-fire\">along with global temperatures</url>. When it comes to military emissions, only a handful of countries even attempt to report them; of these, only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/germany\">Germany</url> has done so with any rigour. But that may change soon as it vastly increases military spending and becomes more active in wars. The rest mostly fudge, obscure, or ignore the numbers. The same nations that dominate climate summits spend 30 times more on their militaries than on climate action - a telling glimpse of their true priorities. </p><p>International bodies like the UN aid and abet this duplicity. Military emissions are often misclassified as those from \"bunker fuels\" - a technicality that excludes them from national tallies. Worse still, under current reporting, if one nation bombs another, the emissions are counted against the victim, not the aggressor. Such sleight of hand reveals the calculated hypocrisy behind the global military build-up. </p><p>These manipulations matter. Officially, military activities account for 6 per cent of global emissions, or a staggering 2.53 billion tonnes per year. This figure dwarfs the emissions of entire continents: military emissions exceed Russia's or even Africa's total output. One US Abrams tank burns a year's worth of car fuel in a single day. Meanwhile, citizens are gaslit into using paper straws, their carbon savings a rounding error next to the military's unchecked pollution. </p><p>The reality is likely far worse. Dr Soroush Abolfathi, a panellist at the Global Institute for Tomorrow conference, estimates that actual conflict emissions could be 10 times higher, contributing 15-20 per cent of global emissions. Yet ESG institutions and the UN erase this from climate policy. That's not an oversight; it's collusion with ecocide. </p><p>The myth that military emissions begin and end with active conflict is a dangerous fiction. Preparation for war - building bases, moving equipment, maintaining fleets - leaves a vast carbon footprint. The US operates more than 750 military bases worldwide, yet reports none of their emissions. Its \"war on terror\" has produced more CO  annually than Sweden or Norway combined. Even after the bombs stop falling, the reconstruction pumps even more carbon into the atmosphere - 16 billion tonnes, mostly from cement, ensuring war's toxic legacy lingers for generations. </p><p>To treat lofty net-zero targets and peace as separate aspirations would be a fatal error. The military's contribution to climate change will only amplify the crisis' worst effects. History shows that those with power and resources will adapt; the marginalised will be displaced, stripped of assets and forced to migrate. Climate migration is no longer a hypothetical - it is a present reality. Peace and climate justice are inseparable from the fight against poverty and inequality. </p><p>While the world obsesses over individual carbon footprints, militaries - the elephant in the climate room - operate in the shadows, protected by the very institutions that have been charged with saving our planet. We must demand transparent reporting, genuine accountability for conflict emissions and a redirection of military spending towards climate resilience. </p><p>It's high time these so-called defence forces actually defended something worth protecting: our collective future, not just lines on a map.

Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/wang-yi\">Wang Yi</url> in Beijing<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3291425/china-and-india-agree-six-point-consensus-they-resume-high-level-border-talks\">last December</url> signalled an intent to reset ties.

In a move that sent shock waves through Delhi, Washington<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3320176/trump-impose-25-tariff-india-august-1-citing-high-trade-barriers-russia-ties\">imposed a 25 per cent tariff</url> on Indian goods on Wednesday, citing \"significant trade barriers\" and India's continued purchase of Russian oil and arms. </p><p>The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry expressed \"disappointment\" but voiced hope that the tariffs would be temporary. China, meanwhile, has also been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3320196/trump-says-tariffs-talks-china-moving-along-well\">holding talks with US trade officials</url>, as the August 12 expiration of a mutual pause on tariffs fast approaches. </p><p>\"Both India and China share common concerns emanating from American protectionist policies - something that impacts their national interest,\" Srikumar Menon, a former Indian ambassador and retired career diplomat, told This Week in Asia. </p><p>Trump's tariff stance could dramatically change trade equations in South Asia, according to Biswajit Dhar, an economics professor at the Council for Social Development in Delhi. He said that the US president offering to jointly develop oil reserves with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/pakistan\">Pakistan</url> - followed by a suggestion that Islamabad might \"some day\" sell oil to India - had created \"a new dynamic\". </p><p>\"I think he has pushed India and China closer together,\" Dhar said, arguing that US protectionism was a common concern for both Delhi and Beijing. </p><p>Delhi has repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3319894/defence-minister-slams-baseless-claim-india-bowed-pressure-end-pakistan-conflict\">rejected Trump's claims</url> that he brokered a ceasefire between it and Islamabad following their brief armed conflict <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3311697/fighting-stops-india-pakistan-start-narrative-war-sway-global-opinion-over-conflict\">in May</url>, with officials saying that India had not responded to pressure from anyone. </p><p>The US president has further ruffled feathers in Delhi with his demands for greater market access. \"The demands he has been making for access to India's agriculture sector is a strict no for the country,\" Dhar said, highlighting a key irritant in any future trade deal with Washington. </p><p>Despite both being economic powerhouses, the trade relationship between the two Asian giants remains lopsided. India's bilateral trade with China reached US$127.7 billion in the 2024-25 financial year, making China its second-largest trading partner after the US. </p><p>But India's trade deficit with its neighbour to the north also hit a record US$99.2 billion, as Indian exports to China fell and imports surged. </p><p>\"Though bilateral trade is heavily skewed in favour of China, with Indian exports to China valued at only 10 per cent of Chinese imports to India, there is potential for Indian companies to leverage the inherent demand in China's import market,\" said Menon, the former ambassador. </p><p>\"The two sides could focus on non-strategic areas, mutually leveraging the obvious economic benefits emanating from a stronger and more structured B2B [business-to-business] engagement.\" </p><p>India's consumer market is projected to grow by 46 per cent to US$4.3 trillion by 2030, according to the government's India Brand Equity Foundation. </p><p>China is seen as a cost-effective supplier for India's burgeoning middle class, providing everything from electronics and EV batteries to industrial machinery. In turn, China's appetite for Indian rice, spices, and oilseeds is also rising. </p><p>Trade experts caution, however, that India's ballooning deficit must be addressed if relations are to deepen. \"The concern on the Indian side is the imbalance,\" said economist Amitendu Palit, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies. \"For most regional economies, China is a net exporter and India is not an exception.\" </p><p>The issue for Indian exporters who want to sell to China is often non-tariff barriers such as inspection protocols and language hurdles. \"When you speak of issues of quality standards, these are not very easy to overcome, especially as most of the instructions are produced in Mandarin and many Indian exporters are not able to understand that,\" Palit said. </p><p>Typical Indian exports such as leather, gems, jewellery and refined petroleum might not be easy to sell to China, he said, because it has its own production and also imports from Southeast Asia. Yet Palit noted that there was scope for synergy in services, pairing Chinese strengths in transport and travel with India's digital and computing expertise. </p><p>Last year's annual economic survey by the Indian government signalled a rethink, suggesting that the country's firms could source cheaper imports by partnering with Chinese suppliers that were already well integrated into global supply chains. </p><p>But not all Chinese investment is viewed as benign. Some investments pose \"the risk of security breaches\", Palit said, citing the exclusion of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/companies/huawei/news\">Huawei</url> from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3097322/chinas-huawei-zte-set-be-shut-out-indias-5g-trials-over-national\">India's 5G auctions</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3228793/china-urges-india-stabilise-ties-mutual-benefit-after-byds-failed-us1-billion-ev-factory-bid\">restrictions on Chinese EV makers</url>. </p><p>\"The problem in this rationale is that all Chinese investments are not so-called clean investments because there are some investments that can have security implications,\" he said. </p><p>India's EV sector faces its own uncertainties, meanwhile, as China<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3309796/indias-ev-drive-risks-stalling-china-tightens-grip-rare-earth-exports\">tightens export restrictions</url> on rare earth minerals essential for battery production. If rapprochement gathers pace, some of these hurdles could ease. Analysts say areas such as renewables and related tech are ripe for collaboration, provided security concerns are addressed. </p><p>\"There is a constant tussle in the domestic Indian industry, where Indian solar manufacturers want more tariffs on Chinese products whereas solar users want more liberal imports from China,\" Palit said. \"If you want more and more solar panels to be easily available, then you must accept that there is not enough domestic capacity and you must import.\" </p><p>The same is true for other sectors. A productivity-linked incentive scheme launched by the Indian government five years ago has buoyed smartphone production, but the country remains reliant on Chinese imports for many components. \"Maybe, over the long term, [import] dependencies might reduce. But reducing dependency in sectors such as fertilisers, drugs and machinery does not happen overnight,\" Palit said. \"You have to import from somewhere and China is the most competitive.\" </p><p>Other analysts have called for concrete action that goes beyond symbolic gestures like the recent efforts to facilitate cross-border movement of people. </p><p>\"While they [the easing of border restrictions] offer diplomatic warmth and facilitate people-to-people contact, their long-term value depends on resolving deeper strategic mistrust,\" said Nanda Kishor M.S., a senior adviser at the Indic Researchers Forum think tank and head of politics and international studies at Pondicherry University. </p><p>The recent India-Pakistan clashes only further muddied the waters. \"The deployment of Chinese-made weaponry by Pakistan in its conflict with India underscores Beijing's strategic alignment, complicating prospects for normalising India-China trade. Economic engagement cannot be delinked from national security concerns,\" Kishor said. </p><p>Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3295257/chinas-himalayan-mega-dam-deepens-indias-water-worries\">China's construction of a mega dam</url> on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which becomes the Brahmaputra upon reaching India, has stoked anxieties in Delhi about water security. </p><p>Still, both countries saw value in amplifying the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/global-south\">Global South</url>'s voice on issues such as climate justice and equitable development, Kishor said - though bilateral tensions and regional rivalries had hampered their cooperation at global forums. </p><p>In India, some of the harsher anti-China rhetoric that had been common in the immediate aftermath of the Galwan Valley clash had now died down, Dhar told This Week in Asia.

A breakthrough came late <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3283942/why-china-and-india-are-de-escalating-tensions-their-disputed-border\">last year</url>, when Beijing and Delhi agreed to a phased troop disengagement and new patrolling protocols. Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/wang-yi\">Wang Yi</url> in Beijing<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3291425/china-and-india-agree-six-point-consensus-they-resume-high-level-border-talks\">last December</url> signalled an intent to reset ties. That momentum gained pace last month, when Indian External Affairs Minister S.

Last weekend, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman noted \"some kind of beginning\" in a revival of business relations. \"How far it will go is something we will have to wait and see,\" she said. </p><p>\"We need more access and we need to have a lot more interaction, and possibly open some windows\" Sitharaman said. \"And that's not just from our side - even the Chinese have been approaching us.\" </p><p>Anticipation is building ahead of Prime Minister <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/narendra-modi\">Narendra Modi</url>'s expected attendance at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/shanghai-cooperation-organisation-sco\">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</url> summit in Tianjin from August 31, his first visit to China<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2142995/what-modi-and-xi-hope-gain-when-they-meet-china-week\">since 2018</url>. </p><p>Analysts suggest that shifting global headwinds are nudging India and China closer together, even as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states\">United States</url> turns up the heat. In a move that sent shock waves through Delhi, Washington<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3320176/trump-impose-25-tariff-india-august-1-citing-high-trade-barriers-russia-ties\">imposed a 25 per cent tariff</url> on Indian goods on Wednesday, citing \"significant trade barriers\" and India's continued purchase of Russian oil and arms. </p><p>The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry expressed \"disappointment\" but voiced hope that the tariffs would be temporary. China, meanwhile, has also been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3320196/trump-says-tariffs-talks-china-moving-along-well\">holding talks with US trade officials</url>, as the August 12 expiration of a mutual pause on tariffs fast approaches. </p><p>\"Both India and China share common concerns emanating from American protectionist policies - something that impacts their national interest,\" Srikumar Menon, a former Indian ambassador and retired career diplomat, told This Week in Asia. </p><p>Trump's tariff stance could dramatically change trade equations in South Asia, according to Biswajit Dhar, an economics professor at the Council for Social Development in Delhi. He said that the US president offering to jointly develop oil reserves with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/pakistan\">Pakistan</url> - followed by a suggestion that Islamabad might \"some day\" sell oil to India - had created \"a new dynamic\". </p><p>\"I think he has pushed India and China closer together,\" Dhar said, arguing that US protectionism was a common concern for both Delhi and Beijing. </p><p>Delhi has repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3319894/defence-minister-slams-baseless-claim-india-bowed-pressure-end-pakistan-conflict\">rejected Trump's claims</url> that he brokered a ceasefire between it and Islamabad following their brief armed conflict <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3311697/fighting-stops-india-pakistan-start-narrative-war-sway-global-opinion-over-conflict\">in May</url>, with officials saying that India had not responded to pressure from anyone. </p><p>The US president has further ruffled feathers in Delhi with his demands for greater market access. \"The demands he has been making for access to India's agriculture sector is a strict no for the country,\" Dhar said, highlighting a key irritant in any future trade deal with Washington. </p><p>Despite both being economic powerhouses, the trade relationship between the two Asian giants remains lopsided. India's bilateral trade with China reached US$127.7 billion in the 2024-25 financial year, making China its second-largest trading partner after the US. </p><p>But India's trade deficit with its neighbour to the north also hit a record US$99.2 billion, as Indian exports to China fell and imports surged. </p><p>\"Though bilateral trade is heavily skewed in favour of China, with Indian exports to China valued at only 10 per cent of Chinese imports to India, there is potential for Indian companies to leverage the inherent demand in China's import market,\" said Menon, the former ambassador. </p><p>\"The two sides could focus on non-strategic areas, mutually leveraging the obvious economic benefits emanating from a stronger and more structured B2B [business-to-business] engagement.\" </p><p>India's consumer market is projected to grow by 46 per cent to US$4.3 trillion by 2030, according to the government's India Brand Equity Foundation. </p><p>China is seen as a cost-effective supplier for India's burgeoning middle class, providing everything from electronics and EV batteries to industrial machinery. In turn, China's appetite for Indian rice, spices, and oilseeds is also rising. </p><p>Trade experts caution, however, that India's ballooning deficit must be addressed if relations are to deepen. \"The concern on the Indian side is the imbalance,\" said economist Amitendu Palit, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies. \"For most regional economies, China is a net exporter and India is not an exception.\" </p><p>The issue for Indian exporters who want to sell to China is often non-tariff barriers such as inspection protocols and language hurdles. \"When you speak of issues of quality standards, these are not very easy to overcome, especially as most of the instructions are produced in Mandarin and many Indian exporters are not able to understand that,\" Palit said. </p><p>Typical Indian exports such as leather, gems, jewellery and refined petroleum might not be easy to sell to China, he said, because it has its own production and also imports from Southeast Asia. Yet Palit noted that there was scope for synergy in services, pairing Chinese strengths in transport and travel with India's digital and computing expertise. </p><p>Last year's annual economic survey by the Indian government signalled a rethink, suggesting that the country's firms could source cheaper imports by partnering with Chinese suppliers that were already well integrated into global supply chains. </p><p>But not all Chinese investment is viewed as benign. Some investments pose \"the risk of security breaches\", Palit said, citing the exclusion of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/companies/huawei/news\">Huawei</url> from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3097322/chinas-huawei-zte-set-be-shut-out-indias-5g-trials-over-national\">India's 5G auctions</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3228793/china-urges-india-stabilise-ties-mutual-benefit-after-byds-failed-us1-billion-ev-factory-bid\">restrictions on Chinese EV makers</url>. </p><p>\"The problem in this rationale is that all Chinese investments are not so-called clean investments because there are some investments that can have security implications,\" he said. </p><p>India's EV sector faces its own uncertainties, meanwhile, as China<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3309796/indias-ev-drive-risks-stalling-china-tightens-grip-rare-earth-exports\">tightens export restrictions</url> on rare earth minerals essential for battery production. If rapprochement gathers pace, some of these hurdles could ease. Analysts say areas such as renewables and related tech are ripe for collaboration, provided security concerns are addressed. </p><p>\"There is a constant tussle in the domestic Indian industry, where Indian solar manufacturers want more tariffs on Chinese products whereas solar users want more liberal imports from China,\" Palit said. \"If you want more and more solar panels to be easily available, then you must accept that there is not enough domestic capacity and you must import.\" </p><p>The same is true for other sectors. A productivity-linked incentive scheme launched by the Indian government five years ago has buoyed smartphone production, but the country remains reliant on Chinese imports for many components. \"Maybe, over the long term, [import] dependencies might reduce. But reducing dependency in sectors such as fertilisers, drugs and machinery does not happen overnight,\" Palit said. \"You have to import from somewhere and China is the most competitive.\" </p><p>Other analysts have called for concrete action that goes beyond symbolic gestures like the recent efforts to facilitate cross-border movement of people. </p><p>\"While they [the easing of border restrictions] offer diplomatic warmth and facilitate people-to-people contact, their long-term value depends on resolving deeper strategic mistrust,\" said Nanda Kishor M.S., a senior adviser at the Indic Researchers Forum think tank and head of politics and international studies at Pondicherry University. </p><p>The recent India-Pakistan clashes only further muddied the waters. \"The deployment of Chinese-made weaponry by Pakistan in its conflict with India underscores Beijing's strategic alignment, complicating prospects for normalising India-China trade. Economic engagement cannot be delinked from national security concerns,\" Kishor said. </p><p>Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3295257/chinas-himalayan-mega-dam-deepens-indias-water-worries\">China's construction of a mega dam</url> on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which becomes the Brahmaputra upon reaching India, has stoked anxieties in Delhi about water security. </p><p>Still, both countries saw value in amplifying the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/global-south\">Global South</url>'s voice on issues such as climate justice and equitable development, Kishor said - though bilateral tensions and regional rivalries had hampered their cooperation at global forums. </p><p>In India, some of the harsher anti-China rhetoric that had been common in the immediate aftermath of the Galwan Valley clash had now died down, Dhar told This Week in Asia.

Kenya is hosting the Annual Policy Dialogue 2025 on Financing for Sustainable Development themed \"Driving Sustainable Futures for All.\" Convened by Club de Madrid, an international not-for-profit governance lobby, the two-day forum brought together former heads of state and government, policymakers, representatives of multilateral lenders, the private sector, academia and civil society to chart a new roadmap for financing the sustainability agenda. </p><p>Kenyan President William Ruto said the inaugural annual dialogue on financing sustainable development, to be held in Africa, serves as a wake-up call for mobilizing greater resources to realize resilient and inclusive growth. \"The forum recognizes the centrality of adequate, accessible and fair financing as a key driver for the realization of a sustainable development agenda,\" Ruto said in a speech read on his behalf by Cabinet Secretary for Health Aden Duale. Ruto acknowledged that geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global economic slowdown and conflicts have undermined efforts to bridge funding gaps toward sustainable development, escalating poverty and inequality in the Global South. The Kenyan leader stressed that reforming the global financial architecture, making it inclusive and aligning it with the needs of developing countries will be key to unlocking the resources that are required to accelerate green and resilient growth. In a video message, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized that adequate financing is key to realizing the goals of freeing humanity from hunger, poverty, disease and climatic shocks. Guterres said multilateral lenders should embark on people-centered financing, while governments should leverage private capital and negotiate concessional financing to accelerate growth and ease the debt burden. The Nairobi forum is expected to generate recommendations on taxation, debt relief and financial system reforms, topics that will be amplified at major global events this year, such as the Group of 20, International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings.

Maternal mortality has dropped by one-third and women's representation in parliament has improved by 26 percent. But that is not enough,\" she added. \"We continue to see that progress has been slow and uneven, and not in all areas. Whilst progress has been made, the pace has not been enough. UN Women continues to prioritize issues around women, poverty and the prevention of violence against women,\" she noted. Despite important progress, only 87 countries have ever been led by a woman, and a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a partner or member of her own family, she said. The report also features the new Beijing+30 Action Agenda, a roadmap focusing on six actions: a digital revolution for all women and girls to ensure equal access to technology, freedom from poverty, zero violence, full and equal decision-making power, peace and security as well as climate justice. \"The digital revolution for all women and girls is a critical priority, as well as women in decision-making, climate justice issues, and peace and security for women. We want a world of peace,\" Gumbonzvanda stressed. Established in 2010, UN Women is an organization under the United Nations dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women with the aim to accelerate progress on meeting the needs of women and girls worldwide. CHINA'S PIVOTAL ROLE \"Over the past five years, the proportion of women in the total employment population in China has reached 43 percent and that progress is very notable,\" Gumbonzvanda said. \"Women also account for 55 percent of internet entrepreneurs in China and 45 percent among the science and technology workers in China. That is remarkable progress.\" \"China has also made strong efforts to ensure maternal health and safety. In 2023, maternal mortality decreased to 15.1 per 100,000 beds. Of course, no woman should die giving birth, but the decrease in China is quite outstanding,\" she said. \"In education, we also see great progress in China. The enrollment of women in higher education reached 60.2 percent in 2023,\" she added. Gumbonzvanda said that China has been \"a very strong advocate\" for the UN Sustainable Development Goal 1, which calls for ending poverty by 2030. \"That focus has been very critical as China has lifted over 770 million people out of extreme poverty over the last four decades. This is the effort that needs to continue,\" she noted. She expressed her hope that UN Women will step up collaboration with China. \"We want China to continue to be a strong advocate, a strong convener, like we have done 30 years ago, and be the voice around issues of gender equality, the empowerment and rights of women in multilateral spaces like the UN. We really appreciate the continued global voice of China,\" Gumbonzvanda said. \"This year marks the 30th year since the Beijing Conference. We hope China will continue to be a place where we can come to for inspiration and for the world to sustain this agenda. We really appreciate the relationship with China and the role of China in the United Nations,\" she stressed.

This steadfast commitment was underscored by the conclusion of the Invest in African Energy forum held in Paris on May 15.Throughout the forum, key stakeholders from across the continent and beyond convened to address the pressing energy challenges facing Africa. Taking place in Paris ? the city where the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 ? discussions centered on strategies to attract investment, promote sustainable energy development and drive economic growth while prioritizing environmental responsibility, African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector recognize the critical importance of addressing energy poverty, which continues to impede socio-economic progress in many African nations. By fostering an environment conducive to investment and innovation, we Africans aim to unlock the continent's vast energy potential and empower communities with access to reliable, affordable energy sources.The Paris Declaration calls for fruitful discussions and collaborations, highlighting the shared commitment of African nations, global investors and industry leaders to drive sustainable energy development across the continent.Moving forward, we remain dedicated to championing Africa's energy agenda, advocating for policies that balance economic growth with environmental stewardship, and empowering African nations to realize their energy potential while advancing climate goals.We recognize Africa?s sovereign right to develop its energy resources ? which include north of 125 billion barrels of oil and 620 trillion cubic feet of natural gas ? in a balanced and sustainable manner. Ramping up energy investment, deploying continuous finance and advancing energy projects represent Africa?s core priorities, as 600 million Africans lack access to reliable power and 900 million Africans lack access to clean cooking fuels. Projects like the TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG development and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline seek to maximize Africa?s resources for the benefit of local communities. In West Africa, developments such as Perenco?s Cap Lopez LNG Terminal and associated LPG facility, the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline and the Eni-led Congo LNG project will catalyze long-term economic growth and energy resilience, with natural gas, LNG and LPG set to play a critical role in the continent?s energy poverty reduction strategy. The Southern African region is only just starting to realize the full potential of its oil and gas resources, with recent discoveries made in Zimbabwe?s Cabora Bassa Basin by Invictus Energy and Namibia?s prolific Orange Basin by Shell, TotalEnergies and Galp. Namibia is also home to the development of sub-Saharan Africa?s largest green hydrogen project led by Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, while Mauritania is pioneering green hydrogen through Chariot?s Project Nour and CWP Global?s AMAN Project, coupled with expanded gas development from the bp-operated Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project.Despite Africa?s unmet energy requirements, global energy lending has only tightened, as major European and other Western banks exit the fossil fuels industry in Africa, while financing fossil fuels in Western countries. These institutions have not been equitable when it comes to facilitating adequate energy and climate finance for African countries, where local populations are disproportionately affected by both climate risks and restrictions on fossil fuel development. Europe has made repeated calls for natural gas and green finance, yet there is a considerable blockage on energy finance for African countries. This chokehold continues to inhibit Africa?s industrial growth and the establishment of critical gas-driven industries like power, petrochemicals, fertilizers and mining, keeping the continent at a developmental lag.We Africans deplore the continuous polarization of the energy dialogue in Western countries and call on the demonization of African oil and gas to stop. We urge free market solutions to Africa, and not a continuous push for aid so that Africans pledge to leave their resources in the ground. More aid is not the answer. Investment is key. From Cape to Cairo, from Nairobi to Dakar, we stand united toward meeting our shared obligations to fight climate change, noting that wealthy nations need to decarbonize and Africa needs to industrialize.It is the position of African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector that African countries must diversify available pools of capital and create financial instruments outside of traditional institutions ? tapping into private equity and non-conventional bonds ? to fund new exploration and energy initiatives. Moreover, African countries must put in place attractive regulatory and fiscal terms, thereby creating an enabling environment and removing all barriers to investment, such as incohesive regulation, excessive red tape or nationalistic policies. With competitive terms and incentives in place ? followed by the integration of ESG principles and capacity building requirements ? African energy projects will be able to compete effectively for global capital and work toward making energy poverty history across the continent.\u00a0Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.Download image:    20.05.2024 CET/CEST Dissemination of a Corporate News, transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group AG.The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.The EQS Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements, Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.Archive at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eqs-news.com\">www.eqs-news.com</url></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>1907009\u00a0\u00a020.05.2024\u00a0CET/CEST </p>", "publisher": "EQS TodayIR", "instances": ["05. 2024 / 19:10 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.", "2024 / 19:10 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.

Women's and girls' rights are facing unprecedented growing threats worldwide, from higher levels of discrimination to weaker legal protections, and less funding for programs and institutions that support and protect women, said the report released by UN Women, ahead of International Women's Day. The report, titled \"Women's Rights in Review 30 Years After Beijing,\" found that in the past decade, the world registered a disturbing 50 percent increase in the number of women and girls living in conflict. </p><p>\"Recent global crises -- like COVID-19, the climate emergency, soaring food and fuel prices -- are only increasing the urgency to respond,\" it said.

For Africa, South Asia, and other Southern regions, the challenge is not only to expand energy access but to do so equitably, without exacerbating environmental degradation or social inequality. In this unfolding energy transition, China's growing leadership in renewable energy and green infrastructure presents both opportunity and responsibility.

It has also become a major financier and builder of green infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America through platforms such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund.</p><p>In Africa, Chinese companies have played a significant role in expanding access to solar energy in rural communities, where traditional grid expansion remains cost-prohibitive. From solar mini-grids in Kenya and Nigeria to hydropower and wind energy projects in Ethiopia and South Africa, China's presence is reshaping the continent's energy mix. The Garissa Solar Plant in Kenya, built by China Jiangxi International Economic and Technical Cooperation Co Ltd, is among the largest solar plants in East Africa and has been instrumental in improving grid stability. Similarly, in South and Southeast Asia, Chinese investment has helped countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam develop large-scale solar and wind installations that contribute to energy diversification and resilience. The Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park in Pakistan, one of the largest in Asia, was constructed with Chinese financing and expertise and now contributes significantly to the country's power grid.</p><p>Yet the significance of China's role extends beyond hardware and finance. It is also influencing the structure of global energy governance. As Western investors and multilateral institutions often hesitate to back large-scale projects in fragile or low-income states due to risk or debt concerns, China is filling the gap \u2014 albeit with its own strategic calculus. By offering concessional loans, blended finance and turnkey engineering solutions, China enables countries in the Global South to leapfrog into renewable energy without relying on fossil-intensive pathways.

A just transition requires more than decarbonization \u2014 it demands economic inclusion and empowerment. Joint ventures, skills training and local manufacturing of green technologies must become integral to China's energy engagements. Encouragingly, there are examples of progress: Chinese solar companies have partnered with local manufacturers in Egypt's Benban Solar Park to produce solar panels domestically, while in Ethiopia, the Aysha Wind Farm project included provisions for training local engineers. These models must be replicated and scaled to ensure broad-based benefits and sustainable ownership.</p><p>Second, transparency and debt sustainability are critical. While many African and Asian governments welcome Chinese finance for energy infrastructure, concerns remain about opaque loan terms and debt distress. A just transition cannot be built on an unsustainable financial foundation. Instruments such as the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments could serve as a platform for constructive dialogue. Furthermore, building capacity in host governments to conduct robust cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments is vital to ensure projects are not only viable but also socially and environmentally responsible.</p><p>Third, China's leadership in critical supply chains \u2014 particularly in solar panels and battery storage, could play a transformative role in democratizing access to green technologies. Currently, developing countries face barriers in accessing affordable and high-quality renewable energy components due to supply chain bottlenecks and trade restrictions. By expanding South-South technology partnerships, licensing agreements, and knowledge exchanges, China can help the Global South reduce its dependency on Northern technology monopolies and diversify the sources of clean energy innovation. China's establishment of renewable energy training centers and innovation hubs across Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa could accelerate the diffusion of clean technologies, support regional manufacturing bases, and create ecosystems of innovation that are adapted to local conditions and climate risks.</p><p>Importantly, China's recent shift toward greening the Belt and Road \u2014 through initiatives such as the BRI International Green Development Coalition and its 2021 pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad \u2014 signals a positive turn.

Oil prices went down 1 percent on Monday after hitting a three-year low below 70 U.S. dollars a barrel last week, driven by uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and concerns that President Donald Trump's policies are disrupting global trade flows. With the theme of \"Moving Ahead: Energy strategies for a complex world,\" the 43rd forum will address pressing challenges related to energy security, supply, and climate ambitions, as well as developments in markets, infrastructure, policy direction, and technological innovations -- particularly those powered by artificial intelligence (AI), according to the forum's agenda. </p><p>Tariffs have emerged as a major topic of discussion, with experts debating whether a new nexus of \"tariffs, trade, and competition\" will shape energy markets and policy, potentially replacing the long-standing global priorities of \"security, affordability, and sustainability.\" \"The energy industry is at a crossroads,\" S&amp;P Global said in a report, citing hovering high inflation, weak economic growth, and rising energy costs among drivers of global uncertainty, which deepen the dilemma of energy transition. The U.S. energy policy is also under intense scrutiny. In a keynote address on Monday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright reaffirmed the Trump administration's commitment to maximize the country's fossil fuel production while dismantling the climate policies of former Democratic President Joe Biden, which he described as \"not effective.\" \"The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side effect of building the modern world,\" Wright told the CERAWeek audience. \"The cure was far more destructive than the disease,\" he said of Biden's policies to combat global warming, including those to promote electric vehicles (EVs), and solar and wind power in the country. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly urged the U.S. energy industry to \"drill, baby, drill.\" However, the country's oil and gas producers are unlikely to increase spending this year, according to Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes, who spoke at the forum on Monday. Simonelli noted that the recent decline in oil prices could prompt producers to scale back drilling efforts, adding that while large producers have not yet signaled changes to their capital spending plans, smaller firms are likely to respond more quickly to price fluctuations. Some oil giants, including Chevron, have already announced workforce layoff. Hours after the forum began, more than 100 protesters marched through downtown Houston and rallied outside the CERAWeek venue, denouncing oil and gas companies and demanding climate justice. Witnesses said several demonstrators were detained by the police. \"From the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast and beyond, we're uniting to confront S&amp;P Global's oil and gas conference, CERAWeek,\" Future Generations, one of the organizers, announced on its website, calling for \"an end to the burning of fossil fuels for the sake of short-term profits\" to ease the world's climate crisis. CERAWeek this year convenes over 450 C-Suite executives, 80 ministers and top officials, with more than 10,000 participants from over 2,050 companies across 80 countries and regions around the world, according to S&amp;P Global. Alongside energy industry leaders, policymakers, and experts, executives from major technology firms including Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google will also share their insights on innovation and the future of technology in the energy sector. Under the CERAWeek Innovation Agora program, which focuses on emerging transformational technologies, more than 250 startups will showcase their work on AI, decarbonization, low-carbon fuels, cybersecurity, hydrogen, nuclear energy, mining and minerals, mobility, automation, and other fields.

Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu successfully visited China last year, during which the two heads of state elevated bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, opening new and broader prospects for bilateral cooperation, Wang noted. Under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, all-around cooperation between China and Nigeria has yielded remarkable results, bringing tangible benefits to their people, he added.

Should they persist in expending energy on advocating \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3214213/if-chasing-gdp-and-consumption-bad-climate-what-are-alternative-economic-models\">degrowth</url>\" in the developed world to address climate change, a seemingly improbable outcome, or should they focus on feasible solutions that could genuinely curb rising global emissions? </p><p>The concept of degrowth is increasingly gaining popularity as an alternative approach to confronting the urgent ecological crisis. The idea was recently highlighted at the Beyond Growth conference by the European Parliament and has been repeatedly advocated by climate activists as a necessary prerequisite to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3228611/g20-energy-ministers-fail-agree-road-map-phase-down-use-fossil-fuels\">phasing out of fossil fuels</url>. Rich countries must put people over profits, they believe, and justifiably so. </p><p>Advocates, spearheaded by economic anthropologist Jason Hickel, propose degrowth as a strategic reduction in energy and resource consumption to restore ecological balance and improve human well-being while addressing social inequality. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/better-life/well-being/article/3043221/better-life-less-more-according-proponents-degrowth\">degrowth movement</url> contends that other approaches to the ecological crisis, like green growth and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/1867398/putting-place-sustainable-development-goals-un\">sustainable development goals</url>, are futile due to their roots in democratic capitalism, which is fixated on economic growth. Consequently, the movement advocates a radical political project aimed at displacing capitalism and implementing degrowth in the Western world, while exempting the Global South. </p><p>While degrowth proponents raise valid concerns about the environmental consequences of continuous growth, the impact of degrowth policies remains open to question. </p><p>For instance, reducing the gross domestic product of developed countries may not have a significant impact on the world's material footprint, given that large rapidly industrialising countries account for about 40 per cent of global carbon emissions. In addition, reducing income in developed countries might impede investment in green technology, potentially hindering progress on climate change mitigation and adaptation. </p><p>Another critical concern revolves around \"dirty degrowth\". As resource and innovation pressures mount due to degrowth policies, industries may opt for cheaper yet more environmentally damaging production methods, undermining the objective of ecological restoration. </p><p>But even beyond this, the incessant bombardment of such concepts appears to be causing more harm than good. Climate activists have been vociferously demanding that advanced economies take responsibility and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3200323/cop27-pakistan-welcomes-loss-and-damage-deal-un-summit?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\">bear the costs</url> of the damage caused by their emissions, and insisting that they promptly transition their production processes, even if it entails temporarily compromising growth. </p><p>As a result, rich countries are becoming increasingly agitated. Instead of constructive action, this mounting pressure has triggered finger-pointing among major carbon emitters. </p><p>Moreover, climate change, once a universally acknowledged concern, has fallen prey to politicisation. Countries exploit it as a diplomatic tool to wield power and influence, diluting its essential global impact. </p><p>Lastly, and most regrettably, the uncertainty surrounding the issue has fuelled a reckless surge in fossil fuel consumption in at least two large rapidly industrialising nations, akin to an arms race. </p><p>Rather than solely advocating degrowth of the rich, climate activists must explore alternative strategies that foster conscious growth for all, and not oppose the principles of capitalism but, rather, leverage them to their advantage. </p><p>Climate activists must envision a future where countries in the South actively contribute to the solution, rather than being passive recipients. The underdeveloped yet resourceful markets of the South could easily be integrated into the renewable revolution by becoming part of its supply chains - uplifting their populations out of poverty and vulnerability, while maintaining profits for developed economies. </p><p>If the South's demand for climate justice is justified, so is the developed world's need for growth and security - both consider these elements crucial for their survival.

Guterres, who is on an official visit to Kenya, said at a media briefing in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi that the industrial north has a moral obligation to help African countries become climate resilient. \"Developed countries must deliver on the 100 billion U.S. dollars a year promised to developing countries and the loss and damage fund agreed in Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt's Red Sea resort city),\" Guterres said, adding that delivering climate justice in Africa is crucial for global peace, growth, and stability. </p><p>While reiterating that the transition to a green and resilient future is urgent in Africa, Guterres called on developed nations and industry to support the continent's quest for decarbonizing key economic sectors like energy.

He added that the climate-induced drought crisis engulfing the Horn of Africa region is a wake-up call for governments, donors, and the private sector to back community-based resilient programs.

According to Mwenda, the torch campaign will push for recognition of Africa's special needs and circumstances, loss and damage, and prioritization of adaptation finance to enhance climate resilience in the continent. Mwenda stressed that local communities have demonstrated resilience and tenacity in the face of the climate crisis, hence the need to place them at the heart of mitigation and adaptation programs. Harnessing indigenous knowledge and innovations will be prioritized by the torch campaign, to enable African communities to cope with devastating impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events, hunger, and water stress, said Mwenda. He called upon governments to come up with forward-looking policies and legislation aimed at spurring grassroots investments in climate adaptation and achieving a green, just, and inclusive transition.

The vision of this conference is \"enhancing ambition and enabling action,\" with the most important agenda item being the provision of $1 trillion annually in climate finance for developing countries. COP29 should inspire confidence and hope in the international community by addressing the issue of how to \"materialize\" ambition, ensuring that ambition does not remain empty talk or become a tool for achieving other goals. Currently, the core concern for developing countries is support for climate financing, and this requires developed countries to fulfill their commitments through concrete actions.The COP29 has attracted representatives from 198 parties, highlighting that climate change has become one of the greatest unifying issues for global cooperation. </p><p>In recent years, COP conferences have frequently been held in developing countries, reflecting the growing awareness and action of the Global South in addressing climate change. On Monday, the first day of the conference, global carbon credit quality standards were adopted, creating the conditions for launching a global carbon market and providing funding for emission reduction projects. These are positive signals, indicating that with the efforts and collaboration of all countries, significant progress is being made in humanity's fight against climate change.\"Green ambition\" is not a pipe dream; its ultimate realization depends on countries implementing it based on their own national conditions and capabilities. Developed countries, having completed the industrialization phase and accumulated capital and technology, are also responsible for about 90 percent of the excess carbon emissions globally. In terms of global climate justice, developed countries should assume the obligations that correspond to their historical responsibility and provide funding to help developing countries pursue climate goals. It must be pointed out that the developed countries' previous promise to provide $100 billion annually to help low-income countries address climate change has yet to be fully realized, significantly hindering global climate action progress.Addressing climate change is a race against time, and there is no room for hesitation or shifting blame. A few days before the COP29, the World Meteorological Organization released a thought-provoking report predicting that 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record. Another focal point of the conference comes from the policy uncertainty in Washington: participants are generally concerned that the next US administration may alter its climate policies, repeating the scenario of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. Certainly, regardless of changes in any country's climate policies, the international multilateral climate cooperation will continue. However, it's hard to imagine achieving global \"green ambitions\" without the participation or a stable role from the world's largest economy. As former EU official Marc Vanheukelen said, \"If they [the US] don't set themselves an ambitious target, why would we?\"As a responsible major country, China has turned goodwill into good actions in addressing climate change. Since 2012, China has maintained an annual energy consumption growth rate of 3 percent, supporting economic growth of more than 6 percent per year. The carbon emission intensity has dropped by 35 percent, and over half of its total installed power generation capacity now comes from renewable sources. China's clear steps toward a comprehensive green transformation of its economic and social development are evident, providing the world with a large amount of low-cost green products and low-carbon technologies. China also participates in global climate governance, helping the least developed countries and small island developing nations enhance their climate resilience. Some Western countries overlook China's contributions and even demand that China take on additional responsibilities based on developed country standards, which is neither objective nor fair.Addressing climate change is a common endeavor for all humanity, and no member of the international community is a bystander. The costs and resistance to advancing global \"green ambitions\" are rising. Some developed countries have not yet fulfilled the \"mandatory question\" of climate financing, and the protectionist measures they have adopted interfere with green product trade and hinder low-carbon technology dissemination. Extreme climate events pose challenges to the entire world. In recent years, Europe has experienced extreme heatwaves and floods, Canada has been ravaged by wildfires, Australia has seen alarming coral reef degradation, and the US has faced frequent hurricanes, wildfires, as well as heatwaves and cold spells, all of which are shocking. One earth, one sky - saving the world is saving ourselves.Humanity stands on the edge of a \"climate cliff,\" and the future of the planet lies in our hands. Supporting climate agreements with real action is both a responsibility for wealthy nations and a survival imperative. It is hoped that developed countries will genuinely address the long-neglected concerns of developing nations, take the lead in emissions reductions, fulfill their funding commitments, and work to eliminate the man-made factors currently hindering climate action, joining with the international community to uphold the world's \"green ambitions.\" </p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["Green ambition\" is not a pipe dream; its ultimate realization depends on countries implementing it based on their own national conditions and capabilities.

The judicial officers said in a communique issued at the end of a three-day symposium held in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi that they will be on the frontline of promoting Africa's green transition, by leveraging progressive policies, laws, and public education. Kenya hosted the Third Regional Symposium on Greening Judiciaries in Africa under the theme \"Strengthening the Role of Judiciaries in Addressing Climate Change in Africa.\" </p><p>Among the delegates who participated in the symposium were chief justices and their deputies, judges, magistrates, heads of judiciary training institutions, researchers, and green campaigners from the sub-Saharan African region. Kenyan Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, in his remarks during the closing ceremony of the forum, underscored the critical role of African judiciaries in strengthening climate response. \"A robust judicial system is key to countering the threats posed by climate change in our continent. We, therefore, count on the judiciary to issue precedence-setting judgments that protect communities on the frontline of the climate crisis,\" Gachagua said. He added that African judiciaries should utilize local and global legislative instruments which seek to compensate victims of climate disasters while obliging industries to limit the emission of planet-heating gases like carbon dioxide and methane. During the symposium, the judicial officers shared knowledge and best practices that would revitalize action on the climate crisis that is taking a heavier toll on the continent's vulnerable communities. Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya Martha Koome said judicial officers, in their resolution, pledged to play a proactive role in supporting national and transboundary efforts aimed at promoting climate resilience. Koome added that as custodians of the rule of law, Africa's judges and magistrates have an obligation to enforce legislation that protects women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, herders, and subsistence farmers from the ravages of climate change. In their joint communique issued at the end of the symposium, the judicial officers pledged fidelity to the constitution, supreme laws, statutes, and international conventions in their bid to deliver justice to communities battered by climate disasters, including droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires.

What now?", "published": "2024-12-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United States election outcome sends a profoundly negative signal to the global climate and environmental community. President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal skeptic of climate change, is poised to return to the White House, likely leading to a drastic reduction in green-energy spending while increasing fossil fuel subsidies. With a track record of \"anti-intellectualism\" and science denial, Trump's transactional approach to policy, epitomized by \"the art of the deal\", raises questions about his willingness to engage in any climate or environmental discussions. It is expected to unleash an international order characterized by a \"deal-making\" mentality, which is not conducive to global sustainable development.</p><p>During his previous term (2017-21), Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, asserting that the US should not bear responsibility for global-emissions reductions under his \"America first\" premise. He viewed the agreement as a threat to US economic growth and jobs in the mining and fossil fuel sectors. Exiting the Paris Agreement would diminish US influence in international climate negotiations and align the US with only a few nations outside the accord, potentially leading to reduced emissions reporting and climate finance obligations. While leaving the Paris Agreement is straightforward, withdrawing the US from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is more challenging as it would require Senate approval. However, if accomplished, it would affect the UNFCCC's budget and the dynamics of future COP climate summits. The US' likely retreat from key global climate frameworks could create opportunities for non-Annex 1 countries to lead and benefit from an early transition.</p><p>At the UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) held in Baku, Azerbaijan, stakeholders from different sectors began to discuss: If the US really withdraws from the international climate framework, how should the climate finance gap be filled? The most feasible solution at present is leveraging funds from private philanthropic foundations or family foundations. Interestingly, some participants privately asserted that the US' influence on global climate governance is already limited, but its absence may bring new opportunities for global climate governance, promote the transfer of leadership in global climate governance, and create opportunities for developing countries to take the lead. China, whose total carbon emissions have surpassed the US' since 2008, will undoubtedly play a more important role in global climate governance, especially in the technology transfer and industrialization of green energy in countries taking part in the Belt and Road Initiative. At the same time, next year's climate summit, COP30, will be held in Brazil. The combined power of the BRICS countries and the Global South will play a key role in achieving the global carbon neutrality goal in 2050. India, for example, has recently demonstrated its determination to advance its leadership by investing heavily in and developing green hydrogen. This pattern change may become a new driving force for global climate governance.</p><p>Another significant implication of the Trump administration on global sustainability is the likely slowdown of green innovation in the US because of restricted research and development budgets in sustainability fields. This could impede global decarbonization efforts through green technologies. Trump may also increase tariffs on green technologies and products manufactured in China, such as solar panels and electric vehicles. Notably, the first term of Trump limited local research on climate change. Even the engagement of American researchers and scientists in writing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports is limited, especially for academics in state universities controlled by federal funding. These will slow down the pace of net-zero transition in the US, which has trickle-down effects for the rest of the world. Trump's recent announcement of Chris Wright, an oil company CEO, as his choice to lead the Department of Energy signals a significant shift away from green energy progress in the US. Wright, a vocal critic of climate change initiatives and global cooperation on the issue who has openly stated \"there is no climate crisis\", dismisses the notion of an energy transition and emphasizes the need for expanding oil and gas production. His alignment with Trump's agenda to maximize fossil fuel use and opposition to climate action will undermine renewable energy advancements and technological developments in the US.</p><p>On climate justice and equity, Trump reduced budgets in his first term for environmental departments and agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, thereby weakening domestic climate initiatives. Despite devastating events such as Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic damage, Trump consistently failed to acknowledge the connection between such disasters and climate change, potentially minimizing the urgency of addressing climate impacts. One clear example of this approach was the Trump administration's advocacy for a significantly higher discount rate of 7 to 10 percent to calculate the present-day value of future climate damages, compared to the 3 percent rate used during the Obama administration. A higher discount rate diminishes the importance of future damages by assigning less weight to their impacts, effectively lowering estimated costs. This tactic not only downplays the severity of climate damages but also fosters intergenerational inequity by disregarding the long-term consequences for future generations. The refusal to recognize the link between climate change and natural disasters perpetuates a harmful cycle of inaction, undermining efforts to address the escalating risks of climate change.</p><p>As we navigate Trump's post-truth, anti-science era, the pressing question remains: Can we address the climate crisis effectively? Reframing and coalition-building could serve as micro-level interventions to foster bottom-up or middle-out organizational change. During the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act was a successful bill that reframed climate-related renewable energy investments as a means to control inflation, lower household energy costs and boost the economy. While framing climate change as an existential threat has not been effective or may not even be allowed under the Trump administration, presenting green technologies as a way to gain a competitive advantage for the US could be a strategy to persuade Trump to continue funding climate technologies. Coalition-building is also key to maintaining climate action happening at different levels, especially for coalitions with diverse stakeholders, ranging from multinational corporations, and international organizations to local civil society.</p><p>It is important to recognize that despite federal control, states still retain a degree of autonomy and control over many aspects. At the COP29 in Azerbaijan, the official US delegation and side events organized by the Biden administration attracted little attention. However, the \"America Is All In\" pavilion stood out. This coalition, comprising states, cities, indigenous tribes, businesses, schools, religious and cultural organizations, represents \"whole-of-society mobilization\" in the US, covering over 60 percent of the national economy. During a news conference at COP29, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, speaking as an alliance representative, underscored that federal election outcomes should not hinder states' ongoing efforts to promote clean energy and improve energy efficiency standards. In a similar vein, California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, openly voiced his continued support for green technology development and collaboration with China regardless of the presidency during his visit to Hong Kong in 2023. This shows how alliances that operate outside the federal government have the potential to serve as critical drivers of climate action. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, environmental policies often take a back seat in the Legislative Council. One prominent example was the unsuccessful implementation of the waste-charging program, which is still lacking a clear roll-out plan. The reason behind this phenomenon could be the lack of environmental constituency in the Election Committee. Given Hong Kong's pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, it could be tremendously beneficial for Hong Kong to establish a cross-sectoral and cross-tier action alliance. It could serve as a catalyst for progress and ensure regular oversight of government initiatives on decarbonization.</p><p>Community-based actions are another source of hope, with civil societies and academia continuing to drive initiatives to sustain impact at different levels. Former UN Climate Change executive secretary Christiana Figueres emphasized that while the election results may have been a setback for global climate action, efforts continue to decarbonize the economy and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. \"The vital work happening in communities everywhere to regenerate our planet and societies will continue, imbued with a new, even more determined spirit today,\" she said. As the world prepares to embark on a new phase of international climate cooperation with the committed New Collective Quantified Goal of $300 billion for developing countries to cope with climate damages, actors worldwide will persist in the battle against the shared climate crisis, striving to advance progress amid global turmoil.</p><p>The author, a climate policy researcher at Princeton University, is deputy convener of the Youth and Capacity Building Sub-Committee, the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development.</p><p>The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chinadailyhk.com/upload/main/image/2024/12/12/6763ad4d57ca2a78be7017501033a310.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["Wright, a vocal critic of climate change initiatives and global cooperation on the issue who has openly stated \"there is no climate crisis\", dismisses the notion of an energy transition and emphasizes the need for expanding oil and gas production.

This strategic diversification is not just an economic necessity but also a means of ensuring long-term stability in an increasingly uncertain global environment.</p><p>One area where BRICS has been particularly forward-thinking is in the establishment of alternative financial systems, such as the New Development Bank.

Having closely observed Malaysia's foreign policy over the years, this dual role presents a unique opportunity for the country to enhance its global influence, champion regional interests, and contribute to the evolving multipolar world order.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRICS\u2014consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa\u2014has grown into a formidable force that challenges the dominance of Western-led institutions like the IMF and World Bank. For Malaysia, joining this bloc would not only elevate its status in global affairs but also align with its long-standing commitment to advocating for a more just and equitable international order. I've seen firsthand how Malaysia has consistently pushed for the interests of developing nations, particularly within the United Nations and other multilateral platforms. The inclusion of Malaysia in BRICS would be a natural extension of this legacy, allowing the country to more effectively champion causes like sustainable development, climate justice, and fair trade practices\u2014issues that resonate deeply within the ASEAN region and beyond.</p><p>The timing of this potential move is crucial. As Malaysia prepares to lead ASEAN, the region faces significant challenges, particularly in navigating the growing geopolitical tension posed by the super power. Malaysia's leadership will be instrumental in maintaining ASEAN's unity and centrality in this complex landscape. Malaysia's past chairmanship of ASEAN, especially in 2015 tell how the country skillfully managed regional dynamics and upheld ASEAN's non-alignment policy. By potentially joining BRICS, Malaysia could further strengthen ASEAN's position by fostering deeper economic and political ties with the bloc, thereby enhancing the region's collective bargaining power and providing a counterbalance to external pressures.</p><p>The global economic landscape is also in flux, with rising protectionism and unilateralism posing significant challenges to economies like Malaysia's. Malaysia, alongside its ASEAN neighbors, has had to navigate these shifts carefully. Joining BRICS would open up new avenues for Malaysia to diversify its trade partnerships, reducing its reliance on traditional Western markets. This strategic diversification is not just an economic necessity but also a means of ensuring long-term stability in an increasingly uncertain global environment.</p><p>One area where BRICS has been particularly forward-thinking is in the establishment of alternative financial systems, such as the New Development Bank. Malaysia's involvement in these initiatives could enhance its financial resilience and provide the strategic autonomy needed to weather global economic shocks. This move would not only benefit Malaysia but also set a precedent for other ASEAN nations seeking to bolster their economic sovereignty.</p><p>Looking back at Malaysia's foreign policy principles\u2014rooted in neutrality, non-alignment, and the peaceful resolution of disputes\u2014it's clear that the country is well-positioned to advocate for a multipolar world where power is more equitably distributed. This vision is not just about maintaining balance among global powers but about ensuring that all nations, regardless of size, have a voice in shaping the future. Malaysia's potential membership in BRICS, coupled with its leadership of ASEAN, would allow it to play a pivotal role in bridging the interests of both blocs, fostering greater South-South cooperation, and contributing to a more balanced international order.</p><p>In this moment of opportunity, Malaysia has the chance to not only redefine its own future but also influence the trajectory of global governance. The challenges we face\u2014from climate change to geopolitical tensions\u2014demand a leadership that is both visionary and pragmatic. By embracing the strategic possibilities offered by BRICS and guiding ASEAN with determination and foresight, Malaysia can help forge a path toward a more equitable and stable world, ensuring that the voices of the Global South are not just heard but heeded in the corridors of global power.</p><p>This is a defining moment for Malaysia, one that could set the tone for the nation's role in the 21st century. The decisions made today will reverberate for generations to come, and it is incumbent upon Malaysia to seize this moment with both hands.

During his previous term Trump had expressed concern about the issue and had urged the nation to import more American goods, notably agricultural produce. </p><p>The blanket tariff threat is cause for alarm, says Jamus Lim, an associate professor of economics at the ESSEC Business School, Asia-Pacific. </p><p>\"It would not be surprising if India will be caught in a broad-based enactment of tariffs by the United States,\" he said. </p><p>On the upside, Delhi could also benefit, with more giant US firms diversifying their supply chains to India as Trump - who has vowed to intensify the trade wars with China - seeks to decouple its economy further from Beijing. </p><p>India, which is part of the informal Quad grouping along with the US, Australia and Japan, could also secure more trade leverage because the country is seen as a counterbalance to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region spanning vital trade corridors. </p><p>\"Trump will be good for India. He values close friendships. He seems to have a good rapport with Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi,\" said Christopher Blackburn, a British political analyst. </p><p>Trump returns to a geopolitical stage roiled by wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, which have cost America tens of billions, driven up the cost of living and seen Asia's alliances reconfigure across a fractured map. </p><p>The president-elect says neither war would have happened on his watch. </p><p>China has stood behind a sanctioned Russia and North Korea has sent troops to fight Ukraine, in exchange for lifeline economic aid. </p><p>As Western sanctions were lumped on Russia, India has refused to condemn Moscow, its biggest arms supplier. </p><p>Trump claimed during his campaign that if he returned to the White House, he would end Russia's war in Ukraine within \"24 hours\", a declaration played down by Moscow in the aftermath of his election win. </p><p>Yet the potential for a cessation of the Russia-Ukraine war also carries the potential for a chain reaction with North Korea, which is likely to lose its Russian aid if the conflict ends. With an economy in a dire condition, that could restart stalled diplomacy over its nuclear ambitions. </p><p>\"Right now, Kim has no reason to talk to Trump - that only changes if the Ukraine war ends. If the Ukraine war ends and North Korea begins to feel economic pressure,\" said Harry Kazianis, senior director of national security affairs at the Centre for the National Interest. </p><p>Pyongyang won't come to any agreement with the US on anything unless Russia stops giving North Korea \"what is likely billions of dollars in economic aid\", he added. </p><p>During the campaign, Trump reminded his fans of his \"love letters\" and personal connection with Kim. </p><p>The prospects of a box office fourth meeting would appeal to Trump, said Kim Joon-hyung, an opposition lawmaker and diplomatic expert who served as the head of Korea National Diplomatic Academy. </p><p>\"However, Kim Jong-un would ask for prior trust-building measures such as the lifting of some sanctions\" as the North Korean leader believes he has now the upper hand, armed with larger nuclear weapons and delivery means. </p><p>According to Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul, Kim Jong-un is so clearly invested in missiles, nuclear weapons, and relations with Russia that \"personal letters and even summits are unlikely to be enough to change direction\". </p><p>Any fresh engagement with Kim aimed at freezing North Korea's nuclear ambitions risks rattling Seoul, which wants full unconditional denuclearisation. </p><p>But \"if North Korea comes to the table with intent and good will, an environment conducive to trust-building that can enable the possibility of moving beyond a freeze to a roll-back might be possible\", said Sydney Seiler, senior adviser, CSIS Korea Chair. </p><p>\"I can imagine a possibility of 'exploratory summitry' - North Korea willing to engage at the leader-to-leader level - but not in a way that 'passes' or 'sidelines' Seoul.\" </p><p>Defence spending, troop deployments and burden sharing with allies could also be scrutinised under Trump, he said. </p><p>The American taxpayer funds the deployment of the costly THAAD missile defence system in South Korea as well as nearly 28,000 US soldiers. Twice as many are based in Japan, a decades-old US ally, as a backstop to any regional ambitions by China. </p><p>While a sudden disengagement seems unlikely, security watchers say Asian governments are no longer betting the house on US support. </p><p>In the face of growing threats from China, Russia and North Korea, Japan has already committed to jointly develop a new combat aircraft with Italy and the United Kingdom. </p><p>\"This is the new normal, not only for Japan, but many countries, as they attempt to deal with a more unorthodox US,\" said Stephen Nagy, professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University. </p><p>Over time, Japan will continue to diversify some of its security partnerships away from the US. </p><p>Tokyo had already done so in recent years through reciprocal access agreements - or security and defence cooperation between two countries' defence forces - with Australia, the UK and the Philippines, Nagy noted. </p><p>A more \"transactional approach\" is ahead for the whole region, adds Ian Hall, international relations professor at Australia's Griffith University, and that may reshape America's commitments to the Indo-Pacific. </p><p>Pressure to pay more for some elements of Aukus - the defence grouping of the US, the UK and Australia - including the planned transfer of Virginia-class submarines to Australia may soon come to bear. </p><p>Formed in 2021 to counter China's growing influence, Aukus is aimed at deepening security and defence-related technology and delivering nuclear-powered conventionally armed submarines to Australia. </p><p>The programme is expected to cost Australian taxpayers between A$268 billion (US$178 billion) and A$368 billion by the mid-2050s. </p><p>While Trump could persist in America's strategic competition with China and impose steep tariffs on Chinese-made products, Hall said it was hard to say what Trump might do beyond that. </p><p>\"To be frank, we just don't know,\" Hall said, adding that in the South China Sea, Washington was likely to continue to carry out freedom of navigation operations, and to bolster cooperation with its key allies such as the Philippines. </p><p>\"But there is always a chance that Trump might attempt some grand bargain with Beijing, which could see big changes for the region.\" </p><p>Whether those would herald a reduction in US presence or assets deployed in the region is unclear. </p><p>Nagy added that with regard to Taiwan and the South China Sea, Trump is likely to continue much of what the Biden administration did, but \"tweak it at the periphery and say that a previous administration did it terribly, but he improved it tremendously\". </p><p>\"We're going to see surprisingly more continuity than change in foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. </p><p>Trump may also insist that beneficiaries of America's defence blanket help out Washington's wider trade and tech war against China. </p><p>That is a cause for concern for Southeast Asia's biggest nations, which are now threaded through with the supply chains of competing US and Chinese economies and harbour ambitions to become the trade centre of the world, a position made possible by staying \"neutral\". </p><p>The new Trump administration is likely to have \"less patience for Southeast Asia's preference for hedging or nonalignment\" according to Hunter Marston, a Southeast Asia researcher at the Australian National University. </p><p>\"[The administration will] expect more from them when asked to support US objectives, particularly in checking China's expansion and influence,\" Marston said. </p><p>Under Trump, there might be \"more frequent and less risk averse freedom of navigation operations\" challenging Chinese claims in the South China Sea, he added. </p><p>Washington has \"a near consensus on rules-based competition with China and cooperation with Indo-Pacific allies and partners\", according to Easley of Ewha University, giving some predictability to a second Trump White House stay. </p><p>But the threat to hard-earned environmental commitments posed by a president - and his political movement - notorious for scorning the climate crisis and efforts to pare down fossil fuels cannot be underestimated, experts say. </p><p>In 2017 Trump withdrew America from the Paris Climate agreement which aims to keep global heating to within 2 degrees Celsius and below this century. The pullout took effect in 2020 and Biden rejoined as one of his early acts of government. </p><p>But Trump has repeatedly said he will again exit the Paris deal, a legally binding international treaty on climate change, which in the very least could choke funding for climate programmes likely to have a significant impact on developing economies, analysts say. </p><p>\"The Cop in Baku is going to start under a very challenging political context, one in which the US will not have a mandate or political will,\" said Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends, referencing the Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku that starts next week. </p><p>\"It may lead to further lack of progress on important elements like hiking cash for climate action, and may create more impediments than solutions on contentious matters like trade.\" </p><p>Biden's government ushered in a landmark Inflation Reduction Act, bringing billions of dollars of investments into clean energy and electric vehicle development. </p><p>Trump had previously criticised climate finance mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund, as wealth redistribution schemes unfavourable to the US. </p><p>Labanya Jena, a sustainable finance specialist, said a second Trump term would mean a \"cut down in public spending for climate action, or even termination of the Inflation Reduction Act\". </p><p>Trump had vowed to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, promising to dismantle the Biden administration's \"green new scam\", and leading chants of \"drill, baby drill\" to show his support for the US oil fracking industry. </p><p>\"Trump's victory is a profound blow to global climate justice and an alarming escalation of climate risk for the world's most vulnerable communities,\" said Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2024.

China's technologies and low-cost products in fields like new energy have become a driving force for global energy transition, helping countries to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce carbon footprints, the experts said while addressing a seminar on the greening of CPEC organized by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), an Islamabad-based think tank.

Marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of New China, China carried forward its great cause of national development and pressed ahead with Chinese modernization with vigor and determination.</p><p>In 2024, facing a critical juncture in history, we upheld fundamental principles while breaking new ground in diplomacy; and we responded to a fast-changing landscape with composure and confidence. Our diplomatic efforts have helped foster a favorable external environment for China's high-quality development and provided much-needed stability to a turbulent world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over the past year, a remarkable new chapter has been written in head-of-state diplomacy, which has steered the trend of the times toward peace, development and win-win cooperation.</emphasis></p><p>President Xi Jinping attended three home-ground diplomatic events-the Conference Marking the 70th Anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, and the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), made four important overseas visits-to Europe, to Central Asia, for the BRICS Summit, and to Latin America, and attended several multilateral summits. With the global vision, broadmindedness and sense of common good for humanity befitting the leader of a major party and a major country, President Xi has had in-depth strategic communications with global leaders and dignitaries to broaden converging interests for all and promote greater unity and cooperation of the international community.</p><p>In President Xi Jinping's interactions with foreign leaders, friendship and trust are the subjects they talk about most and mutually beneficial cooperation a prevailing consensus. It is the widely shared view around the world that President Xi keeps in mind the imperative of peace and development, that he upholds multilateralism, fairness, justice, openness and cooperation, and that he believes in a global response to global challenges. Such an approach is set to have a positive and far-reaching impact on human progress and development.</p><p>Through meetings, letters and many other means, President Xi Jinping has made personal efforts to reach out to the people of other countries, thus winning greater popular support for the healthy growth of state-to-state relations. We cherish old friends who have contributed to the friendship between their countries and China, and value the commitment and input of people from various sectors to developing friendly ties with China. We will work with our friends from around the world to build bridges of amity and bonds of affinity and turn the steady streams of friendship into a powerful force for world peace and development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over the past year, new breakthroughs have been made in building a community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village.</emphasis></p><p>Building a community with a shared future for mankind is an important vision put forth by President Xi Jinping. It provides an incisive answer to the important question of \"what kind of world to build and how to build it.\" It envisions a historic progress in state-to-state relations from the pursuit of peaceful coexistence to that of a future shared by all. It shows the world a bright prospect of peace, security, prosperity and progress.</p><p>The building of a community with a shared future for mankind has become a great enterprise joined by various parties. In the course of 2024, China and Brazil have announced joint efforts to build a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as two emerging countries; China and Serbia have launched efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the first of its kind in China's relations with European countries. Globally, a growing number of countries have pitched in to build a community with a shared future. What's worth mentioning in particular is that Chinese and African leaders have agreed to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era, giving expression to the shared desire of the 2.8 billion Chinese and Africans to pursue common development in greater solidarity. China has also made efforts to build communities with a shared future with particular regions, including with Central Asia, ASEAN, countries in the Lancang-Mekong river basin, Arab states, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. These efforts are opening up new vistas of harmonious coexistence between different civilizations.</p><p>Building a community with a shared future for mankind also reflects the relentless pursuit of a fair world. At the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, President Xi Jinping comprehensively and systematically elaborated China's vision on global governance, offering insights and solutions from the perspective of long-term historical evolution and from the height of the shared future of all humanity. He put forward ideas and propositions for improving global governance in the economic, financial, trade, digital and eco-environmental dimensions, injecting strong impetus into the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. With the joint efforts of China and other countries, the notion of humanity sharing a common future has been written into multiple resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations (U.N.) and multilateral documents, and the goal of building community with a shared future has been established in various fields such as cybersecurity, climate change, and health. We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N., supported the U.N. in holding the Summit for the Future, and endeavored to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We have accelerated the implementation of the three major Global Initiatives. To date, 82 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, 119 countries and international organizations have given support to the Global Security Initiative, and the 78th U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by China to establish an International Day of Dialogue among Civilizations.</p><p>Building a community with a shared future for mankind has been established as the noble goal for practicing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. We have actively worked for the restoration of world peace and endeavored to save human lives. On the Ukraine crisis, we have always maintained an objective and impartial position, and actively pushed for peace talks. Over the past year, our special envoy conducted three rounds of shuttle diplomacy. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. We also brought other Global South countries together to launch the group of \"friends for peace\" to gather consensus for finding a path to peace.</p><p>The Gaza conflict has taken too many civilian lives. The immediate priority is a comprehensive ceasefire, the key is to ensure humanitarian assistance, and the fundamental way out is to realize the two-state solution. Over the past year, we have pushed for the adoption of the first resolution by the Security Council on a ceasefire in Gaza, facilitated the reconciliation dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration by various Palestinian factions, and delivered multiple batches of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. We will continue to make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question. We have mediated peace in northern Myanmar and facilitated multiple rounds of peace talks among conflicting parties. We have supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and realizing peace and reconstruction. We have also made consistent efforts to promote the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. Facing the dramatic change in Syria, China will continue to stand with the Syrian people and uphold the \"Syrian-led and Syrian-owned\" principle. China opposes the attempt of terrorist forces to exploit the situation to create chaos, and will help Syria maintain its sovereignty and restore stability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over the past year, we have provided new opportunities for the world with Chinese modernization, which has promoted the development trend of modernization in countries around the world.</emphasis></p><p>China has blazed a path of modernization suited to its national conditions. With our successful exploration, we have given other developing countries greater confidence in pursuing modernization. At the same time, we are willing to work with the international community to promote modernization in countries around the world that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation, and common prosperity.</p><p>China has actively promoted global development. No country should fall behind on the path to modernization. We have made substantive progress in promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in light of the urgent needs of participating countries. The China-Europe Railway Express has provided over 100,000 freight train services in total. The Port of Chancay is becoming the newest landmark of the new Asia-Latin America land-sea corridor. With 155 countries joining the big family of Belt and Road cooperation, this road to happiness is growing ever broader. In view of the widening development deficit, President Xi Jinping announced at the G20 Summit China's eight actions to support global development, which include strengthening cooperation with other countries in key areas such as poverty reduction, food security, and scientific and technological innovation. To answer the historical question of what kind of modernization to pursue, President Xi Jinping solemnly proposed that countries should jointly advance modernization that is just and equitable, open and win-win, that puts the people first and features diversity and inclusiveness, and that is eco-friendly and underpinned by peace and security. These six propositions meet the needs of the vast number of developing countries and point the way forward for modernization in countries around the world.</p><p>China has been promoting its high-quality development through high-standard opening up, and offered vast opportunities for the modernization of countries around the world. The appeal of China's institutional opening up has continued to grow, with further shortened negative list for foreign investment and fully opened manufacturing sector. China's supersized market has been offering benefits to the world at a faster pace, as it gave all LDCs having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines and hosted the China International Import Expo for seven consecutive years. We are opening our market wider to the rest of the world. China has been introducing policies for easier travels to China, including unilateral visa waivers to 38 countries and visa-free transit for 54 countries. \"China Travel\" is gaining in global popularity. China has voluntarily subscribed to high-standard international economic and trade rules, generated renewed momentum for developing a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), and firmly advanced trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, powering global economic growth steadily.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over the past year, China's cooperation with other developing countries has set a fine example, which has reinforced the trend of uniting for strength within the Global South.</emphasis></p><p>The collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South.</p><p>China promoted new proposals and new developments of mechanisms and strengthened the force for unity and progress in the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations, so as to leave their mark on the progress of humanity. Building on its historic expansion last year and setting off this year from the new starting point of greater BRICS cooperation, BRICS is bringing more partners into its big family to make the platform a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations. Considering the reasonable concerns of developing countries, China promoted the adoption of a U.N. General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building, proposed the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, worked with fellow Global South nations to jointly launch an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science with fellow Global South nations, and pushed for the adoption of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance at COP29. China called on developed countries to take concrete actions to earnestly fulfill their due responsibilities, provide sufficient financial support to developing countries, and uphold global climate justice.</p><p>China has stayed committed to the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and helped fellow developing countries move faster in rejuvenation. At FOCAC, China and Africa agreed on the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Action Plan for stronger cooperation between the two sides in the next three years, and agreed on ten partnership actions for modernization covering 10 key areas such as trade and investment, industrial chain cooperation and green development in an all-dimensional boost to Africa's development. China and Arab states saw significant early harvests from the \"eight major cooperation initiatives\" and went on to develop \"five cooperation frameworks\" in five dimensions: innovation, finance, energy, economy and trade, and people-to-people exchanges. China deepened the synergy of development strategies with Latin American and Caribbean countries, and continued to upgrade its cooperation with Pacific island countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over the past year, China has made new progress in pursuing all-round diplomacy, which has built up the trend toward a new type of international relations.</emphasis></p><p>China has stood for dialogue and partnership rather than confrontation and alliance, fostered major-country dynamics featuring overall stability and balanced development, and worked with its neighbors for an amicable and harmonious home in Asia. China has developed a new approach to state-to-state relations featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation.</p><p>China-Russia relationship, under the visionary guidance of the heads of state, has grown more mature and stable, demonstrated in a clearer way its independence and resilience, and set an example of friendly exchanges between major countries and neighbors. The three meetings between President Xi Jinping and President Putin this year further deepened the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. The two countries maintained close communication and coordination on multilateral platforms, such as the U.N., BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and in regional affairs, fulfilling their responsibilities as major countries. China-Russia relations are based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party, and are not subject to interference or coercion from any external factor. Amid shifting global dynamics, China and Russia will maintain a high degree of strategic mutual trust, support each other's development and revitalization, and jointly safeguard global strategic stability.</p><p>Europe holds an important position in China's diplomatic agenda. A healthier and more stable China-Europe relationship serves the fundamental interests of both sides and the common aspiration of the world. In May this year, President Xi Jinping paid a historic visit to Europe. The visit ushered the China-France diplomatic relationship, which has spanned 60 years, into a new 60-year cycle of further development, enhanced the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia, and elevated the China-Hungary relationship to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era. President Xi Jinping also engaged in in-depth strategic communication with leaders of European countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy on bilateral and multilateral occasions, and encouraged the European side to take a long-term and strategic perspective, see China as a partner and strengthen dialogue and cooperation to the benefit of both sides and the world at large. China and Europe are two great civilizations of the world and two major forces of the times. China stands ready to work with the European side to handle differences and disputes properly, seek win-win solutions, and jointly safeguard free trade and multilateralism.</p><p>China and its neighboring countries share more converging interests and deeper friendship and mutual trust. Party and state leaders of Vietnam paid visits to China. The building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future got off to a good start. The new Indonesian President visited China twice, first following his election victory and then after his inauguration, with China being the first country he visited in each capacity. The \"four wheels \"of China-Indonesia cooperation have been upgraded to \"five pillars.\" China and Malaysia celebrated the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, and the building of \"Two Countries, Twin Parks\" has been vigorously advanced. The China-Singapore all-round high-quality future-oriented partnership is full of vitality. China's traditional friendship with Laos and Cambodia has become ever stronger and written new chapters. China and the five Central Asian countries have upgraded the comprehensive strategic partnerships, jointly ushering in another 30 golden years.</p><p>Regional cooperation, which China has been participating in and advancing, is brimming with strong vitality. The \"Lancang-Mekong Visas\" were launched. The China-ASEAN FTA 3.0 Upgrade Negotiations have been substantially concluded. The secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism started operation. The SCO admitted Belarus as a new member, and a new platform of \"SCO plus\" has been established. Chinese Premier and Prime Ministers of Russia and Mongolia held a meeting and agreed to expedite the building of China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor. Regional connectivity is also gathering momentum. The China-Europe Trans-Caspian Express opened. The intergovernmental agreement on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project was signed. The \"Tianfu\" cross-border freight truck to Central Asia was launched. Important progress has been made in key projects such as the China-Vietnam cross-border railway, the China-Mongolia cross-border railway, the China-Singapore Land-Sea New Corridor and Malaysia's East Coast Rail Link. All these reflect regional countries' shared aspiration for regional integration.</p><p>China is having more trust and less suspicion with major countries in this region. When meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Xi Jinping put forth important propositions on improving China-India relations, which received positive response from Prime Minister Modi. The two sides agreed to step up strategic communication, safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas, and strive to bring the bilateral relationship back to the track of stable development at an early date. China and Japan reaffirmed the commitment to promoting the China-Japan strategic relationship of mutual benefit in an all-round way, and to building a constructive and stable relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. In line with Japan's commitment on the discharge of nuclear contaminated water, China has recently started independent sampling and monitoring and will work with the international community to urge the Japanese side to earnestly fulfill its international obligations and responsibilities.</p><p>Dear Experts and Friends,</p><p>There is a lot of interest in China-U.S.relations. How China and the United States get along concerns the well-being of the two peoples and also the future of the world. This year, we have followed the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, focused on implementing the San Francisco Vision, and worked to maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations. China and the United States held two rounds of strategic communication and five meetings of the Financial Working Group and the Economic Working Group respectively. The two sides advanced practical cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, law enforcement and climate change, extended the science and technology agreement, and co-signed each other's resolution on artificial intelligence at the U.N. General Assembly. Nearly 15,000 young Americans visited China through the initiative of \"50,000 in five years,\" sowing the seeds of friendship between the two countries.</p><p>Such progress has been widely welcomed by Chinese and Americans across the sectors as well as the international community at large. This fully shows that as long as China and the United States cooperate with each other, they can accomplish many great things together. In the meantime, China firmly safeguards its sovereignty, security and development interests, and firmly opposes the illegal and unreasonable suppression by the U.S. side. In particular, with regard to the U.S.' gross interference in China's internal affairs such as Taiwan, China has to make a firm and robust response to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests and safeguard the basic norms governing international relations.</p><p>Last month, President Xi Jinping met with President Biden and sent a congratulatory message to President-elect Trump, providing strategic guidance for the growth of China-U.S. relationship at this critical juncture. President Xi Jinping summed up seven pieces of experience and inspiration based on a thorough account of bilateral exchanges in recent years, and drew four clear red lines that must not be challenged, namely, the Taiwan question, China's path and system, democracy and human rights, and China's development right. He stressed that China's goal of a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged; its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged; its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged; and its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remains unchanged. This is not only the authoritative interpretation of China's U.S.policy, but also our earnest expectation on future China-U.S. relationship. The fact that China has maintained its U.S. policy stable and consistent demonstrates its firm strategic resolve and broad-mindedness as a major country. We will engage in dialogue, manage differences, enhance mutual trust, remove misunderstandings and expand cooperation with the U.S. side, and work with the U.S. to explore the right way for our two major countries to get along with each other on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world.</p><p>Dear Experts and Friends,</p><p>China's diplomacy is always under the CPC's leadership. We are unswervingly committed to the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee over diplomacy. We uphold Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, especially Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, as the fundamental guideline, follow through the strategic planning of the CPC Central Committee on diplomacy, and work to bring about greater coordination and stronger synergy for China's diplomacy. The Party's leadership is the most defining feature of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and our greatest political strength to overcome all risks and challenges.</p><p>China's diplomacy is always people's diplomacy. We wholeheartedly act on the abiding commitment of serving the people through diplomacy. Over the past year, we have safely evacuated over 10,000 Chinese compatriots from overseas high-risk regions. A safe passage back home from Lebanon was secured in just 48 hours. More than 50,000 consular help-seeking cases have been handled, and over 3,000 suspects for telecommunications fraud and online gambling repatriated. Our action is a clear proof to all compatriots that, wherever they are, the motherland will always be there for them.</p><p>China's diplomacy is always about standing up for responsibilities. We firmly safeguard the interests and dignity of the nation. We have resolutely countered the attempt of using Taiwan to contain China and the myth of seeking U.S.support for \"Taiwan independence,\" firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and effectively strengthened the international community's commitment to the one-China principle. We have taken justified and firm measures to safeguard China's rights against certain countries' provocations in the South China Sea, and worked with ASEAN countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea. We have refuted false narratives hyping up the so-called \"human rights issues,\" set the record straight, and gained overwhelming support from over 100 countries for China's just position. More countries have come to realize that playing double standards will only disgrace oneself and interfering in others' internal affairs is ultimately unpopular.</p><p>Looking back on the magnificent journey of China's diplomacy, we have noticed some important trends and changes in China's interactions with the world. First, China's policies, especially major concepts and initiatives put forth by President Xi Jinping, are increasingly well-received and supported by the international community. Second, in addressing global challenges, major hotspots and difficult issues, the world increasingly looks to China whose active participation has become indispensable. Third, the Chinese path to modernization is gaining greater international significance, and more countries now understand and recognize the success of China's development path.</p><p>These major achievements are fundamentally attributable to the stewardship of General Secretary Xi Jinping, who made strategic judgment at every crucial juncture and steered the major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era. They are also attributable to the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, which correctly defines China's relations with the world amid overall human development and the evolving world landscape, making sure that China's diplomatic vision and foreign policy always meet the shared aspirations of most countries, always conform to the laws of historical progress, and always hold international moral high ground. China today is already a responsible major country with enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to lead new endeavors, and greater moral appeal.</p><p>Dear Experts and Friends,</p><p>Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war. It will also mark the 80th anniversary of the founding of the U.N., another key moment in the history of humanity. Looking ahead to the developments next year, one can anticipate a notable rise of uncertainties and instability in the international landscape. What choices countries make will determine the course of our times and have implications for the international landscape. In China's diplomatic endeavor, we will continue to bear in mind the larger picture, shoulder responsibilities for the greater good, and advance the right and just cause, and we will continue to hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, and do our best to promote world peace, tranquility and the common progress of humanity.</p><p>First, China will be a firm force for peace in a world of turbulence and conflicts. We hope the incoming U.S.administration will make the right choice and work with China in the same direction to avoid disruptions, overcome obstacles, and achieve the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations. We will deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and all-round practical cooperation with Russia, and work for steady progress in China-EU relations toward independence, mutual success and benefit to the world. Stability in China will provide a strong underpinning for global strategic stability, and certainty in China will help cushion uncertainties in other parts of the world. We will carry forward the Chinese way of settling hotspot issues and continue our constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and other hotspot issues such as the Korean Peninsula and Myanmar.</p><p>Second, China will be a firm force for unity in the face of division and confrontation. We support the holding of the second China-Central Asia Summit, and will work for the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN FTA 3.0 Upgrade Protocol. We have properly handled differences and are working with India to find the right and bright path for big, neighboring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side. We will partner with Africa in implementing the ten partnership actions for modernization, expedite the building of \"five cooperation frameworks\" with Arab states, and use the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum as an opportunity to open a new chapter of cooperation. We will continue to pool the collective strength of the Global South through unity.</p><p>Third, China will be a firm force for openness in the face of decoupling and severing supply chains. We will deliver on the eight major steps of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, advance both the major flagship projects and the \"small and beautiful\" livelihood programs, and create new space for win-win cooperation of higher quality, enhanced resilience and greater sustainability. We are determined to pursue higher-standard opening up, accelerate the development of the FTAAP, and safeguard the global free trade system as well as the stable and unimpeded functioning of the industrial and supply chains. We advocate a world economy that is cooperative, stable, open, innovative and eco-friendly, and we are ready to join hands with all countries on the path toward modernization.</p><p>Fourth, China will be a firm force for justice in the face of the countercurrents of unilateralism and bullying. We will hold solemn commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war, promote a correct view of history, uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We will effectively fulfill the role as the SCO rotating chair, support Brazil in hosting the BRICS summit and the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), support South Africa in hosting the G20 summit, and work for a more just and equitable international order.</p><p>Fifth, China will be a firm force for inclusiveness in the face of ideological differences. We will promote the common values of humanity, deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries, join forces for the progress of human civilization, and enhance the mutual understanding and friendship among people of different countries. We will step up experience-sharing on governance and development, tell engaging stories of the CPC, of Chinese modernization, and of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and cement China's friendship with countries around the globe. We will expand two-way exchanges between the Chinese people and people elsewhere, and do our best to stage a successful Asian Winter Games to showcase a diverse China through the charm of ice and snow.</p><p>Dear Experts and Friends,</p><p>The monumental changes of our time call for a grand vision and a keen sense of responsibility. China's diplomatic service will rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, study, contemplate, apply and grasp Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, follow the principles of self-confidence and self-reliance, openness and inclusiveness, fairness and justice, and cooperation and mutual benefit, steadfastly advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, keep breaking new ground for major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and make new and greater contributions to building China into a great modern socialist country, to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and to peace and progress of humanity as a whole.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>SOURCE: MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "China Daily European Edition", "instances": ["N.

While calling for \"delivering climate justice to countries on the frontline of climate chaos,\" he advocated for swift mobilization of the necessary finance and support to enable countries to protect nature and foster sustainable development.

Guterres said at a briefing on the sidelines of the UNCivil Society Conference, which concludes Friday in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, that Africa remains the epicenter of climate emergencies despite its negligible contribution to the emission of planet-warming gases. \"This continent is being blasted by extreme weather, turbocharged by a climate crisis it has done next to nothing to create: From lethal floods in the East to deadly droughts in the South,\" Guterres said. </p><p>He stressed that Africa can overcome climatic vagaries once the continent receives a fair share of investments in renewable energy and other adaptation measures. \"Africa could be a renewables giant,\" Guterres said, noting that the continent is home to 30 percent of the minerals critical to green energy transition and 60 percent of the world's solar resources. Stressing that the United Nations will press for climate justice in Africa, Guterres observed that the continent has received only 2 percent of investments in clean energy in recent decades. The UN chief called on major economies to honor their commitment to finance climate action in Africa, while increasing their contribution to the newly established Loss and Damage Fund. In addition, Guterres said the reform of multilateral development banks is urgent to enhance capital flows to climate action in developing countries, the majority of which are in Africa. He urged the Group of 20 (G20) nations to lead in slashing greenhouse gas emissions while accelerating a just global phase-out of fossil fuels that are responsible for worsening planetary warming. African governments should establish ambitious national climate plans by next year to help attract investments required to enhance the resilience of communities on the front line of the climate crisis, he said.

These actions encompass efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time promote public awareness and education regarding climate change by creating impactful international policies. She said, \"Every single person has the ability and power to make conscious decisions. Big or small, all decisions leave a footprint on our environment, affecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. We must make our decisions wisely before nature has to teach us another lesson.\"<br/><br/>HKMU Council Chairman Ir Dr Conrad Wong Tin-cheung praised Carly Leung Pui-yee and Jasmine Siu Yin-nam for their devotion to climate action and for being role models for the new generation.

Thanks to long-term policies of the government, and sophisticated, distinctive and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, China's low-carbon transformation will help it to achieve high-quality development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet two hurdles stand in the path of China's decarbonization. First, China is not alone in pursuing decarbonization, and many countries are not on track to realize decarbonization. Until all countries' decarbonization plans align with the Paris Agreement, limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (let alone 1.5 C) will be impossible. Although commentators will continue to complain about China's overcapacity in green products, the real concern is the low global demand for such products. Second, while China has made remarkable strides in renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs), it can further enhance its efforts to achieve climate targets by reducing its reliance on coal.</p><p>Indeed, China has the resources and political will to achieve its climate target of peaking its emissions before 2030 and realizing carbon neutrality before 2060.The same cannot be said of the lower-income countries.</p><p>Besides, global climate negotiations are stuck because countries such as India legitimately condition their decarbonization efforts on transfers from high-income countries (the historical polluters), but high-income countries like the United States have always refused substantial transfer.</p><p>There are two ways of breaking the deadlock in climate negotiations: moving on with high-ambition countries by accepting that some countries will not join ambitious climate agreements; and negotiating an agreement that involves substantial North-South transfers. High-income economies such as the European Union, however, would need to contribute financially.</p><p>Such economies may accept a deal for two reasons. One, because they are genuinely concerned about climate change and understand that the only way forward is by contributing to climate justice. And two, since the EU will most likely miss its 2030 climate target (the European Environment Agency estimates that at best the bloc can reduce emissions by 48 percent instead of the targeted 55 percent from the 1990 level), it could circumvent this failure by purchasing emissions allowances from other countries by providing them with due technology and financial transfers.</p><p>With diplomats and researchers from African countries, the EU, Brazil, China and India, we are working on a proposal of international climate policy that could suit the interests of most countries. Here is a summary of a work-in-progress proposal for an \"ecological union\".</p><p>In the short term, economies participating in the proposed \"ecological union \"would establish a uniform carbon price floor at 100 yuan ($13.75) per ton of carbon dioxide, which roughly corresponds to the CO2 price in China's carbon market. The exact price floor would be proportional to the temperature increase in the previous five years' moving average: when global warming ends, the price will be zero.</p><p>A share of the carbon price revenue raised in a given country would be pooled at the global level and rebated to participating countries in proportion to their population. The pooled amount would be proportional to the country's GDP, ensuring transfers from rich countries to poor countries: the farther above the global average per capita GDP, the more a country contributes and the farther below the global average, the more a country receives.</p><p>Besides, countries in the \"ecological union\" would commit not to tax the carbon content of imports from one another, and return the tax collected to the exporting country if they do so. This would neutralize the ecological union's CBAM for participating countries.</p><p>In the medium term, the \"ecological union\" would establish a global carbon market. Each country would be granted emissions rights proportional to its population as a benchmark. There would be some adjustments to the benchmark in line with specific needs and ambitions of certain regions. Especially, China and the EU would get emissions rights corresponding to their respective decarbonization plans.</p><p>This would give more rights than the benchmark to China, and less to the EU.Such adjustments would preserve the overall ambition of the \"ecological union\", helping it to meet the objective of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Importantly, integrating all economies' emissions in a common market would guarantee that each economy respects its target. For example, if the EU ends up emitting more than it aimed for, this will be compensated by other economies emitting less than the world average and selling their emissions rights to the EU.Emissions reductions will take place where they are least costly. And transfers will flow from rich to poor economies, spurring growth and poverty reduction in lower-income countries.</p><p>Adrien Fabre is a CNRS researcher at the International Research Centre on Environment and Development in Paris; and Hu Bin is research director for Global Climate Governance, Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua University.

As a child-focused organisation, World Vision Hong Kong co-hosted the \"Connecting Capital with Natural Reforestation to Combat Climate Change\" symposium on World Environment Day (5 June) with CESGA Alumni Asia and Friends of the Earth (HK). </p><p><br/><br/>World Environment Day this year focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience under the slogan \"Our land. Our future.\" In alignment with this theme, World Vision Hong Kong holds the campaign \"Restore Land, Restore Hope\" with the symposium which aims to address some of the most pressing climate threats by restoring the natural environment, advocating for joint support to combat climate change, and working towards climate justice to create a thriving environment for children and future generations. <br/><br/>Different stakeholders could play a crucial role in allocating capital towards climate-resilient development and facilitating the transition to net zero investments and promoting the adoption of low-carbon technologies. Dr. the Honounrable LAM Ching-choi, SBS, JP, Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development (CCN&amp;SD), stated, \"Climate change is not an academic issue, it's an issue every individual person, every individual family will face. A good solution to help all these families to tackle climate change is a must. And for Hong Kong, if we can support them, and apart from the direct benefit to the individuals here in those (developing) countries is to educate ourselves.\" <br/><br/>Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), the simple way to regrow trees from stumps with living roots through careful pruning and protection, is a cost-effective and award-winning technique to serve both vulnerable communities in terms of enhancing livelihoods and climate resilience, also for a better environment by carbon dioxide sequestration through reforestation. <br/><br/>Tony Rinaudo, the Principal Climate Action Advisor for World Vision Australia, discovered FMNR 40 years ago in Niger and spread FMNR in 27 countries across Africa and Asia, such as Vietman, Cambodia and Indonesia, contributing to the regeneration of millions of hectares of land afterward. \"Trees in these climates and in many climates around the world, they are keystone species that moderate the microclimate, maintain soil fertility, and make life and livelihoods possible if we don't have a healthy functioning environment.\" he asserted. <br/><br/>Tony, the Forest Maker also highlighted FMNR's success in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Timor-Leste, which are projected to have an impact on the lives of over 3.2 million people and target over 2 million hectares of degraded farmlands across the region. The vision of World Vision is to restore 1 billion hectares degraded land in future. <br/><br/>By practicing FMNR, the communities have experienced a remarkable transformation and World Vision stands alone as the organisation to have developed the first carbon project in Africa under the UN Clean Development Mechanism, and now has over 20 years of experience implementing a portfolio of nature-based carbon projects. Back in Hong Kong, the financial sector recognises opportunities for carbon markets to expand and evolve as the world de-carbonizes to fight climate change. World Vision urged investors, corporates and philanthropists to take the opportunity to support truly transformative climate action. <br/><br/>The event attracted about a hundred participants, including members of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, representatives from government bodies, the private sector, civil society organisations, and green groups. Discussions focused on how the private sector in Hong Kong can play a key role in combating climate change along with green finance investment and climate-related financial disclosure, also highlight the importance of socio-economic aspects and World Vision's focus on children in need. <br/><br/>Learn more about World Vision's climate action: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldvision.org .hk/en/our-work/climate-action\">https://www.worldvision.org .hk/en/our-work/climate-action</url><br/><br/>Hashtag: #WorldVision #FMNR #Agroforestery #ESG #ClimateChange #CarbonProject #ClimateAction <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldvision.org .hk/en/\">https://www.worldvision.org .hk/en/</url><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-vision-hong-kong/?originalSubdomain=hk\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-vision-hong-kong/?originalSubdomain=hk</url><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/WorldVisionHongKong\">https://www.facebook.com/WorldVisionHongKong</url><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/worldvisionhongkong/\">https://www.instagram.com/worldvisionhongkong/</url></p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p>", "publisher": "Media OutReach (English)", "instances": ["World Environment Day this year focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience under the slogan \"Our land.

Africa is disproportionately bearing the brunt of climate change, with 17 out of the 20 countries most threatened by climate impacts located on the continent. Recent severe weather events, including severe droughts () in Southern Africa and heavy rains () in Tanzania, Kenya, and Burundi have caused food shortages, fatalities, and displacement. Despite these alarming trends, plans to expand fossil fuel infrastructure, like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), continue to threaten both people and the planet.The REPower Afrika campaign showcases the power and potential of community-led efforts igniting a renewable energy movement across the continent. Communities are standing up against harmful fossil fuels and demonstrating that renewable energy is a viable, equitable alternative. These efforts are fuelling hope for an energy-secure future and freedom from worsening climate impacts.\u00a0Urgent Call for Renewable Energy Investment and Policy SupportFor Africa to realize a just transition to renewable energy, significant investment from financial institutions and developed nations is essential and urgent. African governments must create an enabling framework, enacting policies and regulations that facilitate the deployment of renewable energy and attract substantial investments.Renewable energy is not only a sustainable choice but also a driver of economic development. While fossil fuel projects like EACOP are projected to create 200-300 jobs in Uganda, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) () projects that renewable energy could generate 400,000 to 1.5 million jobs in East Africa by 2050. \u00a0Through the REPower Afrika campaign, communities in the EACOP region (Uganda and Tanzania) are showcasing the potential of renewable energy. Solar installations in communities along the EACOP pipeline are improving people's lives, providing light for children to study but also developing green jobs and enhanced energy access whilst protecting the environment.REPower Afrika is advocating for a future where renewable energy powers our communities, protects our environment, and promotes social and economic well-being. Ten (10) gatherings will be taking place across Uganda and Tanzania, with solidarity actions taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria.\u00a0Protests areas in Uganda: Hoima, Kikkube, Kakumiro  Protests areas in Tanzania: Missenyi, Nzega, Tanga, \u00a0Quotes?REPower Afrika marks the beginning of a transformative journey where communities at the frontline of the climate crisis take the lead in demanding accessible, affordable, and safe energy for all while creating millions of green jobs. Africa?s wealth of renewable energy potential presents a great opportunity for the continent to not only address its own energy needs but also potentially lead the global energy transition. By working together with governments, civil society, and community leaders, we can create a supportive environment for community-centered renewable energy solutions, avert climate disaster, and ensure a sustainable future for all. This is the time for Africa and the Global South to replace the obsolete energy model and fuel a development powered by renewables. ? Landry Ninteretse, Africa Regional Director at 350.org\u00a0\"Uganda faces a significant energy access challenge which hinders economic development and negatively impacts the quality of life for many Ugandans. The high upfront costs, limited financing options, policy and regulatory barriers, and competition from other energy sources are major obstacles to improving electrification rates. To address these challenges, REPower Afrika advocates for off-grid solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids and supports innovative financing models. Additionally, policy reforms and community engagement are crucial for \u00a0creating a supportive environment for private sector investment and ensuring the long-term sustainability of solar projects. REPower Afrika is empowering communities to own and have a voice in the demand for a just transition to a community-centered renewable energy system.\" Edwin Mumbere, Director at Centre for Citizens Conserving Environment\u00a0?We are witnessing firsthand the devastating impacts of climate change across Tanzania and Africa. From deadly floods and erratic rainfall to prolonged droughts devastating crops and livelihoods, the toll on our communities is profound. Despite global agreements like the Paris Agreement, there's a glaring gap between promises made and the real-life struggles of those most affected. Climate funding often misses the mark, neglecting projects that could directly benefit vulnerable communities. It's time for actionable policies that prioritize clean energy solutions, including tax incentives and local manufacturing of renewable technologies, to secure a sustainable future for Tanzania.\" Rehema Peters, Founder of Partnership for Green Future\u00a0?The main barrier to renewable energy across Africa is finance. For the sources of finance, we must turn to the rich countries and corporations that have exploited African countries for fossil fuels and have imposed huge amounts of historical debt to drive their own prosperity within rich nations, with no regard for the development or harmful impacts on communities within Africa itself. It's time to expose the super-rich and the most polluting industries and tax their billions.

The forum also honored 17 Kenyan women whose pioneering initiatives are advancing sustainable development goals and transforming the livelihoods of local communities. Mudavadi noted that women bring a set of soft skills, including emotional intelligence, empathy, communication, and tenacity, that can be harnessed to promote regional peace and stability. He added that reshaping multilateralism and ensuring it is more gender inclusive will be key to creating a just, inclusive, and resilient society amid shifting geopolitics and a global economic slowdown. Tatiana Valovaya, the director-general of the UN Office at Geneva, said Kenya's diplomatic clout will be revitalized upon the inclusion of women in negotiations for treaties on peace, climate action, and improved governance.

The Global Climate Litigation Report: 2023 Status Review, which was compiled by the UNEP in conjunction with the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University in the United States, says that litigation is central to securing a greener and more resilient future for humanity. It was launched ahead of the first anniversary of the UN General Assembly's declaration of access to a clean and healthy environment, a universal human right. </p><p>In its third edition, the report discloses that the number of climate change cases has surged from 884 in 2017 to 2,180 by the end of 2022, with 17 percent of cases being reported in developing countries bearing the brunt of climate disasters. The U.S. leads in climate litigation globally, with 1,522 cases, says the report, adding that victims of climate emergencies in the Global South are in the near future expected to demand justice and compensation through the judicial system.

Many other African countries - from Somalia and Senegal to Libya and South Africa - also experienced unprecedented heat. <br/>Heatwaves and droughts - particularly in the Horn of Africa - are damaging the growth of crops, leading to lower harvests, which is harming food security. This is damaging African countries' economies and posing a serious threat to endeavours aimed at reducing poverty, with more than 200 million of the continent's 1.4 billion population facing extreme hunger. <br/>Africa produces only a fraction of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is one of the hardest-hit continents and suffers disproportionately. Putting it more bluntly, rich countries' profit is poor countries' loss. <br/>As a result, African officials and intellectuals are closely monitoring global climate conferences such as the sixth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6) which concluded its five-day session in Nairobi, Kenya, on March 1. The UNEA-6 passed several resolutions, including enhancing air quality worldwide, proper management of chemicals and waste, boosting effective water policies for agriculture, and eliminating hazardous pests. <br/>Rising temperatures and falling agricultural productivity are not just harming food security but also exacerbating human displacement and the potential for conflicts. Soaring food prices are pushing millions of people into food insecurity and exacerbating poverty in Africa. <br/>While climate change is damaging nature in wealthy nations, it also poses a threat to the lives of millions of Africans. The effects of climate change on health are heavier on Africans, simply because many lack the resources to tackle them. <br/>To reduce poverty and mitigate the effects of climate change on the health of its citizens, Africa needs to adopt climate initiatives and implement prevention measures which require the possession of effective foreign technology. It needs assistance to manufacture vaccines to defeat the contagious diseases killing its citizens. <br/>China is helping Africans mitigate climate change through several Sino-African projects, including cooperation on renewables and clean energy. Beijing has supported African countries in their adaptation to electric vehicles such as buses and reducing their carbon footprint. <br/>China was applauded by African officials at the UNEA-6 summit for its role in Africa's transition towards green mobility. As Kenya's special climate envoy Ali Mohamed said: \"We seek partnership to help achieve our e-mobility aspirations, and China has come on board as a crucial partner.\" <br/>Beijing is also fostering African efforts to implement and sustain green financing. It has played a pivotal role in structuring Africa's road maps for energy transformation and the modernisation of agriculture. <br/>The Global Development Initiative, for example - launched by Beijing in 2021 - could help improve Africa's capacity for green development, with projects to combat desertification and utilise water resources as well as prevent droughts and land degradation.  <br/>Finding solutions to climate change in Africa requires multilateral efforts and the creation of a more cooperative world, one in which wealthy nations play a more supportive role by devoting themselves to recycling, embracing a zero-waste approach and becoming circular economy societies, something a recent UN Environment Programme report strongly recommended. <br/>Bolstering Africa's climate fight and building climate-smart economies can also help Africans avoid conflict and fight hunger. Wealthy nations have a moral duty in an increasingly multipolar world to help Africans deal with climate-sensitive diseases since Africa's health crisis should also be viewed as a climate disaster. <br/>To prioritise climate justice and support Africa's move towards green mobility, wealthy nations should invest in this overlooked continent through funding programmes to boost climate governance measures.

Ruto, the chairperson of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change, pledged to utilize his position to lobby for investments required to hasten the continent's transition to a green and resilient future. Ruto said despite contributing less than 4 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, Africa has borne the brunt of climate disasters, including droughts, cyclones, and wildfires. He urged multilateral lending agencies to develop climate financing packages that are tailor-made for the African continent, where there is an urgency to help grassroots communities cope with the phenomenon. Ruto observed that Africa's huge renewable energy potential offers an opportunity to decarbonize the continent's economies while unlocking green jobs for the youth.

For instance, a fierce race for dominance in electric vehicles (EVs) is under way. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3219585/chinas-lead-electric-vehicles-unassailable-global-north-simply-cant-compete\">China leads</url>, while the United States and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3234790/now-or-never-european-drive-head-influx-cheaper-chinese-electric-cars\">Europe</url> aim to catch up. </p><p>In the early 2000s, realising its limited control over global oil production, China bet big on EV technology and critical minerals. Consequently, it now controls <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3231291/can-us-and-eu-unseat-china-dominant-supplier-green-energy-tech-globally-highly-unlikely-experts-say\">75 per cent</url> of global EV battery production, while also leading in EV sales. </p><p>In response, the US and Europe have swiftly initiated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3213170/us-and-eu-claim-progress-reducing-china-reliance-through-critical-raw-minerals-club\">critical mineral agreements</url> to boost EV production. But this pursuit of renewable hegemony, often masquerading as a \"just transition\" driven blindly by national interests, is posing profound challenges for the working class across the globe. </p><p>Technological progress mustn't equate to joblessness. It should, instead, elevate well-being by reducing workers' hours for the same output. Yet within capitalism, workers find themselves entangled in cutthroat competition - a fight to maintain relevance - forcing a significant segment off the playing field altogether. </p><p>The automotive sector lays bare this <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3040486/carmakers-are-shedding-80000-jobs-around-world-era-electric\">harsh reality</url>. Projections foresee at least half a million autoworkers facing job losses globally by 2040. And while there is hope for the creation of new jobs, there is genuine concern that these may not align with the skill sets of those being displaced, leaving them stranded amid the transition. </p><p>The impoverished South might face an even bleaker reality. While EVs have a less labour-intensive assembly process, the critical minerals that go into them require significantly more labour. Millions of workers in the Global South toil in exploitative mining industries that supply these crucial materials. </p><p>Recently, for instance, the US collaborated with Saudi Arabia to secure mining assets valued at US$15 billion in African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guinea and Namibia. Unfortunately, the working conditions for miners in these countries are appalling. In the DRC, for example - a rich source of cobalt for EV batteries - most miners earn less than US$8 per day. </p><p>Yet, inadequate wages are just the tip of the iceberg. Human rights organisations have repeatedly uncovered and verified <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3212109/indonesias-nickel-sector-under-scrutiny-chinese-workers-allege-inhumane-working-conditions\">allegations of abuses</url> at such mining sites. These include murders, attacks on communities, safety violations, pandemic-related health breaches, environmental impact and widespread fraud. </p><p>With the energy transition, working conditions are anticipated to worsen. Mining companies' monitoring mechanisms are not keeping up with the rapid exploration expansion, implying that the energy shift may exacerbate abuse in an already troubled sector. </p><p>The unpredictability and lack of readiness within the global energy system could also heighten economic instability and inflationary pressures, especially in the Global South. </p><p>This vulnerability was underscored by the US<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3221217/us-g7-reveals-sanctions-list-targeting-hundreds-entities-helping-russias-war-ukraine\">sanctions</url> on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. In 2021 and 2022, global gas and oil prices rose sharply, causing a ripple effect on various commodities - notably food - given their critical role in the global economy. The abrupt shift strained the market's adaptability, pushing millions of people in the Global South below the poverty line. </p><p>This could recur. Today, nearly every significant energy analyst foresees not just the persistence of energy price fluctuations during this transition, but a further intensification. </p><p>McKinsey &amp; Company, for instance, echoes this sentiment. It reports that energy enterprises will grapple with disturbances stemming from both macroeconomic factors and energy-specific jolts. These include instability in commodity prices, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3223758/climate-change-asian-firms-must-accelerate-decarbonisation-efforts-catch-global-warming-targets\">heightened demands</url> to curtail carbon emissions, and disruptions in supply chains. </p><p>The climate-vulnerable world is right to advocate for a \"just transition\", but caution is necessary. While the idea seems promising, under the current socio-economic structures and ecosystems, these populations will bear the brunt of the change. </p><p>Remember, although the green transition may be a bitter pill for the rich, the 1 per cent will eventually find alternative avenues of profit extraction, making their transitions relatively manageable. The real challenge lies in the shift of the livelihoods of the masses - those toiling in the mines, coal plants and on oil rigs. Where will they turn once their industries are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3228611/g20-energy-ministers-fail-agree-road-map-phase-down-use-fossil-fuels\">phased out</url>? Perhaps they will be phased out, too. </p><p>To be clear, progress is a necessity not a choice, and renewables are the inevitable future. But at COP28, it is crucial for governments to recognise and champion the plight of the working class and, fundamentally, uphold the balance between \"people\" and \"progress\". For, what good is saving the planet if its people still endure needless suffering? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rizwan Basir is a sociologist who works as a climate finance specialist at the Climate Resourcing Coordination Centre (CRCC), based in Islamabad, Pakistan</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2023.

Climate action is dwarfed by the scale of the challenge. If nothing changes, the world is heading toward a 2.8-degree temperature rise - toward a dangerous and unstable world, he warned. He called for climate action to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees. The move from fossil fuels to renewables is too slow, he said. \"We must make up time lost to foot-dragging, arm-twisting and the naked greed of entrenched interests raking in billions from fossil fuels.\" The proposed Climate Solidarity Pact calls on major emitters, who have benefitted most from fossil fuels, to make extra efforts to cut emissions, and on wealthy countries to support emerging economies to do so. Developed countries must reach net-zero emissions as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, he said. There is a need for a transformation to rebuild trust. Governments must push the global financial system toward supporting climate action. That means putting a price on carbon, and overhauling the business models of multilateral development banks so that they leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries, he said. All parties must operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund at this year's UN Climate Change Conference. Developed countries must meet the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar commitment for developing countries, replenish the Green Climate Fund, and double adaptation funding.

Chris Kiptoo, the principal secretary in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, stressed that African countries deserved financial and technical support from major emitters as the climate crisis unfolds in the continent, destabilizing livelihoods and ecosystems. </p><p>\"The global north has a duty to aid our quest for climate resilience through adaptation financing and that is the core message African negotiators will be delivering at the upcoming global climate summit in Egypt,\" said Kiptoo. He spoke during a meeting with a group of African climate justice campaigners in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, where a resolution calling for a common position to advance the continent's green agenda was adopted. Kenya this week played host to Pan African green campaigners who received the Climate Justice Torch that has been traversing several countries in the continent to raise the visibility of the devastating impact of a warming planet. The Torch will later be presented at the 27th UN Climate Summit slated for Egypt from Nov. 6 to 18 where compensation for victims of climate emergencies in Africa will be a major theme.

However, once the carbon tariff is implemented, it will have an important impact on the global trade of high-carbon products, bring additional costs to the high-carbon commodities exported by developing countries to Europe, reduce the competitiveness of relevant industries in developing countries, and increase the burden of emissions reduction and affect economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.</p><p>To sum up, developing countries face difficult trade-offs between achieving rapid economic growth and addressing climate change, and are in urgent need of financial and technical support from developed countries. However, in reality, developed countries have failed to shoulder their responsibilities, even tending to abandon cooperation and pursue unilateralism. Addressing climate change is the common goal and responsibility of mankind. In order to ensure sustainable development, the international community must pay attention to the complex challenges and difficulties faced by developing countries in climate action, and advocate developed countries play a more active role in global climate governance.</p><p>The author is dean of the China Institute for Energy Policy Studies at Xiamen University.

Hosted by Kenya in partnership with the African Union and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Sept. </p><p>4-6 summit that ran parallel with Africa Climate Week showcased the continent's determination to chart a low-emission growth trajectory, subject to the availability of funding, cleaner technologies, know-how, and innovations. In his opening remarks at the summit on Monday, Kenyan President William Ruto said the continent is ripe for a green transition, but financing bottlenecks and shifting goalposts by Western lenders stood in the way. According to Ruto, Africa was receiving a partly 3 percent of global climate finance, yet the continent suffered most from global warming as evidenced by mounting hunger, water stress, and fragility of vital ecosystems. More than 20,000 delegates, including a dozen heads of state and government, ministers, industry leaders, innovators, campaigners, and researchers, attended the Africa Climate Summit held under the theme \"Driving Green Growth and Climate Finance Solutions for Africa and the World.\" Heavy on the call for robust financing, the three-day summit generated over 26 billion U.S. dollars in pledges from public and private sector entities, multilateral lenders, and philanthropies to help implement climate resilience projects in Africa. The Nairobi Declaration, which was read by Ruto during the summit's closing on Wednesday, called for a carbon tax, reform of the global financial system, and debt relief to boost Africa's response to the climate crisis. In addition, African leaders, in their declaration, challenged major emitters in the Industrial North to honor the 100-billion-dollar pledge they made in 2009 to help developing countries deal with climate-induced catastrophes. During the three-day Africa climate summit, delegates made a strong case for innovative financing to catalyze green energy transition, establish resilient cities and transport systems, and enhance the health of natural habitats. African countries are spending an average of 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) to respond to climate emergencies including floods, droughts, wildfires and cyclones, noted Josefa Sacko, commissioner for agriculture, rural development, blue economy and sustainable environment at the AU Commission. Stressing that a green transition is imperative to sustain economic growth, health and well-being of local communities, Sacko said Africa must explore innovative financing instruments and implement community-centered adaptation projects. While lauding ambitious and bold resolutions that were adopted at the Africa climate summit, campaigners insisted the journey ahead is laden with pitfalls unless governments make deliberate efforts to bridge the financing gap. Mithika Mwenda, executive director of Nairobi-based Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, noted that the continent required 160 to 240 billion dollars to support climate adaptation by 2030. To unlock climate financing, Mwenda said, African governments should incentivize institutional investors and green start-ups through friendly taxation and abolishing cumbersome regulations. Olufunso Somorin, a regional principal officer at the African Development Bank, said realizing a green and just transition in the continent is feasible once governments prioritize policy reforms to attract nature-positive investments.

The forum provides expert advice and recommendations on indigenous issues to the UN system through ECOSOC. The priority theme for this year's session, which runs till April 28, is \"indigenous peoples, human health, planetary and territorial health and climate change: a rights-based approach.\" In his remarks, Guterres saluted indigenous peoples for the pioneering role they play in efforts to protect nature and preserve biodiversity. For thousands of years, indigenous peoples have pioneered sustainable land management and climate adaption, in places as varied as the Amazon, the Sahel and the Himalayas, he said. \"Indigenous peoples hold many of the solutions to the climate crisis and are guardians of the world's biodiversity,\" said Guterres. \"We have so much to learn from their wisdom, knowledge, leadership, experience, and example.\" He underscored the need to speed up efforts to deliver climate justice and scale up finance and capacities for adaptation and loss and damage.

Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><br/>Editor's Note:<br/><br/>Japan on Monday ended the second round of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated wastewater dumping. Despite widespread opposition both domestically and internationally, Japan has insisted on sticking to its dumping plan. Lee Heonseok (Heonseok), a policy advisor from the South Korea-based NGO Energy Justice Actions, shared his insights with Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen about how the dumping will affect South Korea and how China and South Korea can join hands to cope with this issue. This is the fourth installment of the series.</p><p><br/><br/>GT: Now that Japan has finished the second phase of dumping the nuclear-contaminated wastewater. What is your biggest concern?<br/><br/>Lee: The Japanese government announced that it would continue discharging water in this manner for the next 30 years. The problem of dumping nuclear-contaminated water does not end once the discharge begins. A method is needed to prevent the continued discharge of contaminated water in the future. In the short term, we must not stop criticizing the Japanese government and monitoring contaminated water. In the mid to long term, efforts are needed to change international law, including revising the London Protocol.\u00a0<br/><br/>GT: Would you equate Japan's moves to a kind of \"nuclear terrorism\"?<br/><br/>Lee: In 1993, when the former Soviet Union's white paper on ocean dumping of nuclear waste was published, the Japanese government strongly criticized Russia and called for a ban on dumping nuclear waste into the ocean. As a result, the London Protocol was revised, and ocean dumping of nuclear waste was banned. Now, 30 years later, the Japanese government is dumping nuclear waste into the sea. Dumping contaminated water which contains various nuclides into the sea is a criminal act. In addition, pushing ahead with such an act despite opposition from neighboring countries threatens the safety of future generations, the ecosystem and neighboring countries.<br/><br/>GT: Since President Yoon Suk-yeol took office, South Korea seems to have taken a compromising attitude despite constant public protests against Japan's dumping moves. Yoon even ate a seafood lunch amid concerns. What do you think of the government's attitude? How will the dumping affect South Korea?<br/><br/>Lee: Since his days as a candidate, President Yoon has made \"building a nuclear powerhouse\" a significant election pledge. To him, the nuclear industry is very important. To expand the nuclear industry, he does not mention the dark side of the nuclear industry, such as contaminated water or nuclear waste issues. South Korea is the country closest to Japan. It is also a country that consumes a lot of seafood. Importing marine products near Fukushima is prohibited, but other marine products from Japan are imported. Processed seafood products from Japan are imported without any restrictions. The contaminated water that has begun to be discharged this time will pollute the marine ecosystem near Fukushima. This will eventually significantly impact marine products in nearby areas through bioaccumulation. This kind of pollution will ultimately threaten the health of the people of South Korea. Recently, salt prices in South Korea skyrocketed due to people hoarding salt due to concerns about the discharge of contaminated water. After the discharge of contaminated water, consumption of Korean seafood also decreased, so it is expected that there will be considerable damage to the domestic fishing and fishing industries.<br/><br/>GT: Have politicians given enough importance to the people? How will it affect the Yoon government's approval rating?<br/><br/>Lee: In South Korea, people's interest in Fukushima contaminated water is very high. Korean people eat a lot of seafood and are very interested in their health. Therefore, many people are dissatisfied with the Yoon government's lukewarm response to the Fukushima contaminated water issue. In a recent public opinion poll conducted by Gallup Korea, 60 percent of people responded that President Yoon is \"not performing his duties well.\" And the biggest reason for this evaluation was the Fukushima contaminated water issue (15 percent). The longer the contaminated water problem persists, the more adversely it will affect President Yoon's approval rating.<br/><br/>GT: How can China and South Korea cooperate on this?<br/><br/>Lee: Korean civil society carried out various solidarity movements with Japanese civil society to solve the contaminated water problem. The contaminated water issue was one of the main agendas at the 2023 No Nukes Asia Forum held recently by activists from eight Asian countries and regions. At the 923 Climate Justice March held on September 23, Daisuke Sato, Secretary General of the No Nukes Asia Forum, accused Japan of becoming \"a perpetrator of radiation\" by dumping nuclear-contaminated wastewater.<br/><br/>However, there has yet to be an opportunity for Korean and Chinese civil society to address the contaminated water issue together. There is a need to address the contaminated water issue through various channels, including civil society and academia, along with criticism at the government level. In the future, I hope to address the contaminated water issue together with Chinese civil society.</p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["Lee: Korean civil society carried out various solidarity movements with Japanese civil society to solve the contaminated water problem.

China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, which aims to peak emissions by 2030, suffered from record-breaking heatwaves and severe floods and rainfall this summer, threatening electricity supplies and crops.  <br/>\"A spate of climate disasters over the past few years has raised the alarm on climate adaptation inside China,\" said Li Zhao, senior researcher at environmental group Greenpeace East Asia. \"Flooding in and around Beijing and the surrounding Hebei province this year should be a wake up call. Our adaptation is far behind the rapidly compounding risk climate change poses. In the past few years, a series of adaptation policies have come out, and there remains an implementation gap.\" <br/>Analysts have raised concerns that underinsured China was particularly vulnerable to rising natural catastrophes, which could hurt its economy. The United States and Canada also suffered from wildfires and extreme heat this year. <br/>The UNEP report shows \"a growing divide between need and action when it comes to protecting people from climate extremes\", said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres yesterday. <br/>\"Action to protect people and nature is more pressing than ever ... Yet as needs rise, action is stalling,\" he said. \"The world must take action to close the adaptation gap and deliver climate justice.\" <br/>The UNEP report highlighted the urgency for accelerating climate adaptation, which is a key issue for development and safety in all countries, especially low- and middle-income ones. Adaptation is also expected to be a central topic at the COP28 Climate Conference taking place this month in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. <br/>Every billion invested in adaptation against coastal flooding led to a US$14 billion reduction in economic damage, it is estimated.  <br/>Meanwhile, US$16 billion per year invested in agriculture would prevent around 78 million people from starving or chronic hunger because of climate impacts, according to UNEP. <br/>The failure to adapt to climate change has massive implications for losses and damage, particularly for the most vulnerable. The 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have experienced losses and damage of more than US$500 billion in the last two decades, and these costs will rise steeply in the coming decades, particularly in the absence of forceful mitigation and adaptation, according to UNEP citing previous studies. <br/>\"Even if the international community were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases today, climate disruption would take decades to dissipate,\" said Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, yesterday. <br/>The UN has urged policymakers, multilateral banks, investors and the private sector to step up finance and use the COP28 as an opportunity to fully commit to insulate low-income countries and disadvantaged groups from climate impacts. <br/>Countries globally must massively increase finance - developed countries must present a clear road map to double adaptation finance and prioritise grants over loans as a first step towards devoting half of all climate finance to adaptation, according to the UN. Multilateral development banks should also allocate at least 50 per cent of climate finance to adaptation, and change their business models to mobilise more private finance to protect communities from climate extremes. <br/>By 2025, every vulnerable developing nation should have the support they need to develop and implement adaptation investment plans, and every person on Earth must be protected by an early warning system by 2027, said Guterres.  <br/>He also called on governments to tax the windfall profits of the fossil fuel industry and devote some of those funds to countries suffering loss and damage from the climate crisis.</p>", "publisher": "South China Morning Post", "instances": [".

I balance my work and life based on my needs and don't pressure myself with the Western world's standards of 'work-life balance'. I try to meditate when I can and breathe well to reduce the stress and anxiety that come with the job. I am very family-oriented and spend quality time with loved ones. I love to travel and discover the world, and I'm blessed that my job takes me around the world, meeting amazing human beings sharing similar values. To the women coming from an unprivileged background like me, I would like to tell them that I see them, I believe in them, and I support them to be the leaders the world so need, if we truly want to heal collectively, and shift to a new Earth where people sincerely respect one another as Equal Human Beings (thus, our Moto #WeAreManushyan). Stay tuned to more content and work from Manushya on shifting power and decolonisation!  Music: Nakadia <br/>A techno artist who came from living in an impoverished and rural household in Khun Buri into becoming a leading female techno artist. The only way to have a good work-life balance is to make the best of every day, whatever the day looks like. My work is my life because I basically never take a day off and I work 12-16 hours per day. Traveling, studio work, performing or staying in touch with followers\u2014I enjoy all of it. Advice I would give to aspiring artists is that the DJ scene has changed very much after Covid and currently social media seems to be more important than music. But my advice would be to always follow your heart when it comes to music. Be yourself and play what you love. That makes the difference and people can feel it. If you do that and you can also create a strong social media presence it can be a key to success Fashion: Pipatchara \"Petch\" Kaeojinda<br/>Designer and founder of eponymous sustainable fashion brand Pipatchara which has debuted collections in Dubai Fashion Week. My goal this year is to work and find some personal time for myself to workout or eat things I like. Most importantly, in the past 2-3 years, I've really prioritized my work so I think I have to reprioritize what's important in my life like family, partner, and health. Six years ago, I might have neglected these things, but I'm 34 so I'm trying to watch my eating and sleeping habits, and I think this will help my happiness with my work in the long run. My work relates to fashion, art, and business; as an artist, there might be some aspects of your work that you don't want to do, so finding the right consultant to help out in areas you're not quite skilled at can help with balancing work and give you more time to do things you're passionate about. Pipatchara recently released a new plastic recycle collection called the \"Butterfly Effect\" this summer. We want to represent the idea that one person alone might not be able to create waves but if we bind together for a cause, we'll be able to make some changes. Design: Pattaraphan 'Nok' Salirathavibhaga <br/>Designer and founder of fine jewelry brand Pattaraphan, with followers such as, Hailey Bieber and Gigi Hadid wearing her designs.  It's definitely a challenge to find a work-life balance when you're a designer who also runs her own business. But I'm a strong believer in carving out a time to rest, guilty-free. Intentionally putting some non-urgent tasks aside for the next day and setting time to do things I enjoy is important to keep a good headspace for me. I try to appreciate this restful time daily\u2014even if it's just an hour per day, a quick lunch with friends or an entire afternoon. Advice I would give to aspiring designers is that it's going to work in your favor to be able to do everything from the simplest to toughest jobs. But also know that you don't have to do everything all at once. You can go at your own pace and know that you can achieve anything you put your mind to\u2014as long as you give it love and time.  Dance: Ommi Pipit-Suksun<br/>Attended the Royal Ballet School in London and became the first Thai ballet dancer and fifteen-year-old to win a gold medal in the Genee International Ballet Competition. She became a soloist at the San Francisco Ballet and principal at the Ballet San Jose.  For maintaining a good work life balance, I believe it is important to know oneself, know what drives you and what fulfills you. Once you know your priorities, you can manage your time and achieve the desired work-life balance that is true for you. For me, my work is my passion, so I am happy to be working and dedicating most of my time doing what I love. But because I know that my tendency is to prioritize work, I try my best to schedule time to catch up with close friends and spend quality time with family. Since my work is physically demanding, it's important for me to allocate down time for myself to rest and recharge to maintain a positive mental outlook and ensure that I show up as my best self. Advice I would give to aspiring dancers is to always dance for yourself. Don't dance just to please your parents or your teachers, and make sure that the passion really comes from you. Try to develop good work ethics by listening and retaining teachers' corrections and then applying yourself in class. Stay disciplined and be consistent with your work by showing up\u2014even on days you don't feel like it. More importantly, be patient with yourself because dancing at a high level takes time to incorporate the movements into your muscle memory, as well as develop solid skills, strength, and artistry. I feel, with the current trend of dance competitions, young dancers are being asked to do a lot of difficult steps at such a young age; it's very important for the students to learn to pace themselves. While working hard is a great thing, working smart is even more important for longevity, both physically and mentally.  Film: Thapanee \"Tha\" Loosuwan<br/>Director and screenwriter of \"Blue Again,\" the coming of age debut drama nominated at the Busan International Film Festival 2022 This year, I intend to carve out some time for simple happiness. I think these things will help fulfill the other areas in my life apart from work and help with my creativity. So everyday before work, I'll find some time to cook my own breakfast. I have to come up with new menu ideas that'll be both delicious and healthy. And eating with people I love, I think that can help get rid of the clutter in my head and give me the fire to head into work. I think we should always find opportunities for ourselves, put ourselves in the right environment, and train ourselves to have the skills so we'll be ready to take the opportunity when it comes. This year, I'm releasing a personal project, a romantic short film, so stay tuned. Creative Directing: Porntip \"Mook\" Attakanwong<br/>Photo: Porntip \"Mook\" Attakanwong / Nada Nontapaoraya<br/>Creative director and co-founder of ATT19 and Cocoon, and co-founder and designer of -ade.  As a creative and entrepreneur who also works with her family and boyfriend (who is also my business partner)\u2014I won't lie and say that my work and life is always balanced. I am always inspired by my environment, and that reflects in my work. With my days always looking different depending on my schedule, we make sure we fill in moments in the day where we can enjoy things for ourselves\u2014such as making a stop at a gallery we want to visit when we're in the area for sourcing materials. It's not vain to believe in yourself, it is absolutely essential before you can expect others to. Be strong in your vision. At the same time, be flexible, accepting of critiques and ready to improve. And lastly, be ready to uplift others to grow with you. Photography: Jutharat \"Poupay\" Pinyofoonyachet <br/>New York-based photographer who shot the 95th Academy Awards. Her work has been exhibited in Belgium, Germany, and the United States. She contributes to The New York Times, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, and The Wall Street Journal.  In terms of work-life balance, as a freelancer who doesn't have a fixed schedule, I set my own rest day each week and tried not to work too late each day. Also never forget to eat and hydrate yourself during the day. Health is the most important thing. Advice I would give to aspiring women in the industry is to stay strong with your vision and speak up to support other women in the industry. Dance: Young Ji Kim<br/>Swing dancer and co-founder of The Hop Bangkok, finalist and 3rd place holder in the international dance competition Savoy Cup, painter, sculptor, and mother of two young children. After five years since my first pregnancy and raising two children, I learned to always connect with myself first in the morning. Sleeping enough is truly crucial to balance my life. When I sleep enough, I can do much more without feeling overwhelmed. Since my life is full of uncertainty, I learned to be very flexible and try to be content with imperfections; doing little by little is my approach. Try to make a small win here and there, leading up to bigger and bigger wins. When you decide to work in the art industry, many people might not believe in you at first. But trust me, there's only one individual like you and this world needs you to be expressive. Simply be the best version of yourself instead of competing with somebody else. If you did better than yesterday, give yourself some compliments. I encourage you to believe in yourself and as long as you don't give up, one day people will recognize you as an artist. I'm planning to make more \"Dancing Plants\" art series in the form of paintings, sculptures, and hosting more art workshops in my art studio at The Hop on Silom. I also have some collaboration with a clothing brand and we'll be hosting an international swing dance event called \"Diga Diga Doo\" in Chinatown this September. </p><p>Want the very best stories from BK Magazine delivered straight to your inbox every Thursday afternoon?

In addition to finance, progress on climate adaptation is slowing on all fronts including planning and implementation. </p><p>\"While five out of six countries have at least one national adaptation planning instrument, progress to reach full global coverage is slowing,\" the UNEP report said. \"And the number of adaptation actions supported through international climate funds has stagnated for the past decade.\" </p><p>Meanwhile climate change has become more \"disruptive and deadly\" as temperature records tumbled globally and regionally in 2023, according to UNEP.

Yet as needs rise, action is stalling,\" he said. \"The world must take action to close the adaptation gap and deliver climate justice.\" </p><p>The UNEP report highlighted the urgency for accelerating climate adaptation, which is a key issue for development and safety in all countries, especially low- and middle-income ones. Adaptation is also expected to be a central topic at the COP28 Climate Conference taking place this month in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. </p><p>Every billion invested in adaptation against coastal flooding leads to a US$14 billion reduction in economic damages, it is estimated. Meanwhile, US$16 billion per year invested in agriculture would prevent around 78 million people from starving or chronic hunger because of climate impacts, according to UNEP. </p><p>The failure to adapt to climate change has massive implications for losses and damages, particularly for the most vulnerable. The 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have experienced losses and damages of more than US$500 billion in the last two decades, and these costs will rise steeply in the coming decades, particularly in the absence of forceful mitigation and adaptation, according to UNEP citing previous studies. </p><p>\"Even if the international community were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases today, climate disruption would take decades to dissipate,\" said Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP on Thursday. </p><p>The UN has urged policymakers, multilateral banks, investors, and the private sector to step up finance and use the COP28 as an opportunity to fully commit to insulate low-income countries and disadvantaged groups from climate impacts. </p><p>Countries globally must massively increase finance - developed countries must present a clear road map to double adaptation finance and prioritise grants over loans as a first step towards devoting half of all climate finance to adaptation, according to the UN. Multilateral Development Banks should also allocate at least 50 per cent of climate finance to adaptation, and change their business models to mobilise more private finance to protect communities from climate extremes. </p><p>By 2025, every vulnerable developing nation should have the support they need to develop and implement adaptation investment plans, and every person on earth must be protected by an early warning system by 2027, said Guterres.

And that means rising above disagreements, differences and tensions. </p><p>Geopolitical divisions must not torpedo the world's climate fight for 1.5 degrees,\" he told the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in a video message. \"You are the major economies -- but also the major emitters. And our world has a major climate challenge before us. Today's policies would make our world 2.8 degrees hotter by the end of the century. And this is a death sentence,\" said Guterres. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear that it is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels -- but only if the world takes a quantum leap in climate action. And that depends on the major economies, he said. Guterres called for accelerated action in three areas. First, net-zero deadlines. He called on leaders of developed countries to commit to reaching net-zero emissions as close as possible to 2040 and on leaders of emerging economies to commit to reaching net-zero as close as possible to 2050. \"And I also urge all countries, developed and developing, to step up their national climate action plans, or NDCs, to bring them in line with the 1.5 degrees goal,\" he said, referring to Nationally Determined Contributions. Second, departure from fossil fuels. Renewables can deliver -- on access, affordability, and energy security. And the science is clear: new fossil fuel projects are entirely incompatible with 1.5 degrees. Yet many countries are expanding capacity on fossil fuels, he said. \"And I urge you to change course: phase out coal by 2030 in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and 2040 in all others; end all licensing or funding -- both public and private -- of new fossil fuel projects; make sure generation of electricity is net-zero by 2035 in developed countries, and 2040 elsewhere; decarbonize major sectors faster -- from shipping, aviation and steel, to cement, aluminum and agriculture -- in close cooperation with the private sector; put a price on carbon; shift fossil fuel subsidies to finance a just transition to renewables.\" Third, acceleration of climate justice by reforming the international financial system. He asked the leaders of the major economies, as major shareholders of multilateral development banks, to push them to coordinate their operations better, and to overhaul their business models and approaches to risk, in order to turbocharge climate action and sustainable development. Developed countries must also deliver on the commitments made in previous UN Climate Change conferences. Adaptation must reach 50 percent of climate finance.

A strong, united, multilateral response to this inequity has become an emerging consensus, reaffirmed by convening the Africa Climate Summit in early September and the ongoing Africa Climate Week. In a world fixated on emissions, Africa's paradox is stark: It emits little yet suffers profoundly. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) recognizes the urban-climate connection, as cities are at the frontline of this struggle, with the urban poor hit the hardest. </p><p>Population increases in urban areas, especially in Africa, are making cities hotspots of misery that suffer from flash floods, droughts and heatwaves. The recent devastation from Cyclone Freddy in Malawi and Mozambique is a wake-up call -- over 2 million affected, 600 lives lost, and 140 million U.S. dollars in damage, mostly in urban areas. Astonishingly, despite being home to over 600 million people, African cities receive the least attention in global climate discourse. CITIES: THE MAIN BATTLEFIELD At COP27 in Egypt, the first-ever ministerial meeting on urbanization and climate change acknowledged the critical role of cities in reducing emissions. We flipped the script by putting cities forward as the solution and not only the villain. There should be increasing awareness that the climate battle will be won or lost in cities. Cities need to adapt to the effects of climate change. At the same time, they need to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. The best place to do this will be in Africa. Additionally, the UN Habitat Assembly, held in June 2023 in Nairobi, passed key resolutions reaffirming UN-Habitat's role as the focal point for sustainable urbanization and human settlements. These resolutions highlight the interlinkages between urbanization and climate change. They call upon us to use technology to create smart cities to improve living standards. They underscore the importance of multilevel climate action and the pivotal role of cities and local governments in implementing the Paris Agreement and the National Determined Contributions (NDCs). This echoes the African Union's recognition that climate change is central to the continent's development. Although African countries are beginning to incorporate urban climate resilience into their NDCs, these political commitments must be translated into action on the ground. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS &amp; MULTILEVEL ACTION Partnerships, like the collaboration between UN-Habitat, UNDP and the African Union Commission, highlight the path to resilient urban development and pave the way to effectively implement AU's Africa Urban Resilience Programme. In addition, Kenya is leading an initiative on Building Climate Resilience for the Urban Poor to support the resilience perspective for the more than 54 percent of the urban population living in informal settlements in Africa. Such efforts -- and others being implemented by a wider community of the United Nations, academic and civil society partners -- are supporting the implementation of SDG 11 with a focus on climate action in cities and contributing to achieving SDG 13. FASTER LOCAL ACTION NEEDED Amid Africa's urban climate paradox, a vital challenge looms: the need for localized climate data. This scarcity hampers evidence-based planning, a linchpin of effective climate action. Informed choices rely on precise, context-specific data. Overcoming this obstacle requires collaborative efforts to enhance data collection, monitoring and modeling. Creating resilient cities requires proactive long-term planning, weaving climate priorities into the urban fabric. Climate justice, green energy and innovative financing must be at the core. Yet, along with a shortage of skilled planners, the financing gaps persist. Projections suggest that the loss and damage due to climate change could cost Africa between 289.2 to 440.5 billion U.S. dollars from 2022 to 2030. Fulfilling NDCs requires an estimated 234 to 250 billion U.S. dollars annually until 2030. Inaction is not an option. Creative financing, empowering local communities and addressing climate data gaps are essential. SOLUTIONS ATTAINABLE Moving forward, we must enhance coordination across all levels of government and support inclusive climate action that transforms cities and improves lives. The enhanced role of local government in climate action means investing more to build capacities at the local level. This is the only way to ensure we can implement national strategies and solutions for adaptation and low-carbon development. By undertaking integrated planning that leaves no one behind, embracing ecosystem-based approaches and mobilizing climate finance, we can build thriving urban spaces and human settlements in Africa and protect our shared future. As UN-Habitat, our commitment is unwavering -- we support African countries and cities in taking concrete climate action, providing technical assistance to develop and implement local climate plans and resilience strategies. We will continue to assist countries to access climate funds and promote multilevel inclusive climate governance. We are committed to scaling support to the Least Developing Countries and Small Islands Developing States. Collaborative, data-driven strategies are attractive to investors and donors. Fostering innovation, embracing nature-based solutions and integrating technology into climate action are the keys to success. By building partnerships, engaging civil society and accessing climate funds, we can turn political commitments into tangible change. As of now, we have mobilized 36 million U.S. dollars, a drop in the ocean. What is needed is a seismic shift to help make cities more resilient in this age of multiple crises. The time has come for the Paris Agreement to resonate in Africa's cities. It is time for local governments to play their part in preparing for climate action. The journey forward is collective. My hope for the Africa Climate Summit centers on collective progress. Africa's urban destiny rests on it.

However, lack of financing and enduring divisions between the developed and developing worlds continue to stand in the way. </p><p>Developed cities and countries could help bridge this gap by strategically directing their expertise, technology and financing towards developing regions. Here, sustainability leaders such as Hong Kong could offer key insights. </p><p>Currently, climate finance flows are failing to reach the most vulnerable. Although global climate finance more than doubled from US$360 billion in 2011 to over US$850 billion in 2021, three-quarters of it was concentrated in higher-income regions, bypassing the poorer nations at the greatest risk from climate change, according to Climate Policy Initiative data. </p><p>To close this gap, it is imperative to transform global finance fundamentally. Instruments like resilience bonds can align private finance with sustainability needs. Partnerships between developed and developing countries can further accelerate knowledge exchange and capacity building. By sidestepping donor-recipient dynamics, such collaborations enable mutually empowering exchanges in achieving shared climate goals. </p><p>For instance, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance in Asia, and can share its expertise with developing cities which are trying to mobilise adaptation funding. </p><p>Critically, developed countries must embrace their roles in climate justice, including by meeting their overdue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3153919/cop26-developed-nations-should-meet-climate-finance-pledges\">US$100 billion climate finance pledge</url> to developing countries. Moving from loans to grants would expand developing countries' access to climate funding and self-determination. Prioritising investments in locally-led resilience solutions is vital to building trust and capacities among vulnerable communities. </p><p>While the progress made at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development offers hope, far more needs to be done urgently. As leaders prepare to gather at upcoming forums, they face a historic choice between transformative partnership and dangerous paralysis. We still have time to choose wisdom, courage and solidarity. But that window is closing rapidly. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin Li, researcher, CarbonCare InnoLab</emphasis></p><p>If the unfortunate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3229705/hong-kong-authorities-criticised-doing-too-little-too-late-protect-brydes-whale-overzealous\">Bryde's whale</url> could speak, it would probably have told the boat tour operators who were getting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3229593/should-tourist-boats-be-banned-nearing-whales-carcass-discovery-hong-kong-prompts-calls-restrictions\">too close</url> for its comfort to go away. </p><p>Now it is dead, having sustained injuries including a wound possibly from a propeller. </p><p>The government had warned the public to avoid visiting the waters where the whale was sighted.

Had the industry's input been ignored, then reconsidered at the last minute? Had the authorities taken everything into account before issuing a date? No one could tell. </p><p>Then, there is the death of the Bryde's whale. Soon after the whale was spotted in local waters, hordes rented boats to get a shot of it.

For me this was not just a professional responsibility but a deeply personal one as foreign minister of Pakistan, the country that was ravaged by the climate change catastrophe of severe floods in 2022. The decision at Sharm el-Sheikh to establish a fund to assist developing countries address loss and damage from the adverse impacts of climate change was a momentous first step, a signal of hope for humanity and the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the chair, I proposed the discussion on a loss and damage financing facility last June in the preparations for COP 27. We faced familiar resistance to placing the issue on the Conference agenda. Ultimately, and not easily, we succeeded.</p><p>The impacts of climate change and global warming have progressively become more frequent and ferocious. Those who have contributed the least to global warming are suffering the most. For 30 years, the most vulnerable countries have pressed for a fund through which those who have contributed the most to global carbon emissions would help the vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters and other consequences of climate change \u2014 rising sea levels, drought, hurricanes and floods.</p><p>The epic floods in Pakistan this year, vividly and brutally confirmed the growing magnitude of climate disasters \u2014 with tens of thousands killed or injured; millions displaced; 13,000 km of roads, 2 million homes, 500 bridges and 5 million acres of crops destroyed, and one-third of the country literally under water. My home province of Sindh was the most devastated. It was only after seeing first-hand the scale of loss of catastrophic proportions, the indescribable suffering of innocent people, incalculable damage, and realizing there was no international financial mechanism to address disasters of this scale, that I fully understood the magnitude of the loss, understood the full extent of the damage done, and the absolute necessity to take bold steps to save people and the natural environment.</p><p>This monumental disaster \u2014 and simultaneous floods in Nigeria, drought in the Horn of Africa, and hurricanes in the Pacific and the Caribbean \u2014 reinforced the determination of developing countries to secure climate justice. Pakistan's tenacious efforts, actively supported by the most vulnerable and other developing countries, yielded the agreement at the opening of COP 27 to place this item on the agenda. As the chair, I realized the importance of Pakistan leading the developing countries in the subsequent negotiations at the Conference to press for the establishment of the fund. We commend the Group's solidarity in pursuing the creation of the loss and damage funding arrangements and of the fund itself. We appreciate the ultimate acceptance of the proposal by the developed countries, including the European Union and the US.</p><p>The developing countries look forward to urgent work in the Transitional Committee of 24 members to finalize the fund's institutional arrangements, structure, governance, and terms of reference, as well as to define the elements of the new funding arrangements, to identify and expand the sources of funding and establishing means to ensure coordination and complementarity with existing arrangements. Among the most important tasks for the Transition Committee is to identify the scale of funding required to meet the current consequences of climate change. This may sound technical to the lay reader but it literally means life and death for our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn.</p><p>While the agreement does not establish the legal responsibility of those who have contributed the most to climate change and global warming, it does confirm the central principle of climate justice \u2014 that those who are suffering the most from the impacts of climate change, \u2014 although they have contributed the least to global warming, \u2014 deserve financial support from those who have contributed the most to climate change, and who have done the most damage to the environment.</p><p>A first test of climate justice will be the response to Pakistan's plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction from the floods disaster and efforts to build resilience against future disasters. This plan will be submitted to a Pledging Conference to be convened jointly by Pakistan and the UN secretary-general in January 2023. The World Bank has estimated that Pakistan suffered damage amounting to over $30 billion and will require at least $16.5 billion in urgent external support.</p><p>The loss and damage fund has yet to be operationalized. Pakistan expects that financing for its rehabilitation and reconstruction plan will come from the industrial countries and international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and multilateral development banks. Such support could include debt write-offs, swaps and restructuring; new Sustainable Development Reserves (SDR) allocations or rechanneling of the unused SDRs of the developed countries; direct support for reconstruction projects, as well as private investment for projects that can be structured, e.g. with blended finance, to be commercially viable. We also expect expressions of solidarity from Pakistan's friends in the Islamic world and the Global South.</p><p>Although climate impacts have become inevitable due to the 1.1-degree Celsius global warming that has occurred already over the past 150 years, it remains vital to limit the impacts of climate change as far as possible going forward. More should have been done before. But it is our responsibility not to whine, but to act.</p><p>It is therefore concerning that the adaptation plans of so many developing countries are still not funded. The Glasgow decision to \"at least double\" climate finance for adaptation must be urgently fulfilled. At COP 27, Pakistan proposed immediate implementation of this decision. We expect that at COP 28 in the United Arab Emirates next year we will be able to establish a mechanism to measure and monitor financial flows for climate adaptation.</p><p>Most importantly, the commitment made since 2009 to mobilize $100 billion annually in climate finance has not been fulfilled. The developed countries need to urgently meet this commitment and agree to a New Collective Quantified Goal for larger climate finance from the floor of $100 billion by the next conference of parties in November 2023.</p><p>Of course, the ultimate and common goal is to halt global warming and avoid the \"tipping points\" that climate scientists predict would lead to a global climate catastrophe. However, the onus to ensure that global temperature rise is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius is mainly on the industrial countries which have consumed two-thirds of the \"carbon budget\" over the past 150 years. The remaining one-third of this \"budget\" is what developing countries will need to grow out of poverty and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the mitigation commitments of the Global North must be enhanced and accelerated. Unfortunately, it was evident at COP 27 that the industrial countries had not implemented the mitigation commitments assumed in Glasgow and were reluctant to agree to a larger and faster pathway to reduce emissions and keep the 1.5-degree Celsius target \"alive\".</p><p>Climate action is but one component of the cooperative efforts required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 to end hunger and poverty; promote health and education, restore global growth, and ensure lives of dignity and well-being for all nations and peoples.</p><p>As it concludes its tenure as chair of the Group of 77 and China at the end of this year, Pakistan will make a final push to advance the SDGs and climate goals at a Ministerial Conference of the developing countries in New York in mid-December. The outcomes of this meeting will, we hope, set the agenda that the Global South can promote at the SDG Summit and COP 28 next year.</p><p>It may be too late for the victims of Pakistan floods, but it is my fervent hope that the loss and damage facility will be in place to assist other countries devastated. For what happened to Pakistan will not be exclusive to Pakistan. In 2022 it was Pakistan, next year it could be anyone. Or everyone.

In its sixth Synthesis Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that there are multiple, feasible and effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to human-caused climate change. The IPCC issues a comprehensive scientific assessment report on global climate issues every six to seven years. The previous such report was published in 2014. It provided the scientific basis for the Paris Agreement, which commits its signatories to keep global warming \"well below\" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and strive for a lower limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. </p><p>The latest IPCC report, released in the Swiss tourist resort of Interlaken on Monday, makes it clear that the pace and scale of what has been done so far, as well as the current plans, are insufficient to tackle climate change. As the unprecedented scale of challenge keeps building up to meet the 1.5-degree target, which the IPCC has been highlighting since 2018, the report once again sounds the alarm that urgent action needs to be taken. It focuses on the losses and damages that are already experienced and will continue into the future, hitting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems especially hard. According to Aditi Mukherji, one of the report's 93 authors, \"climate justice is crucial because those who have contributed least to climate change are being disproportionately affected.\" \"Almost half of the world's population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions,\" Mukherji said. Taking the right action now could result in the transformational change essential for a sustainable, equitable world, the report said. \"Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce losses and damages for nature and people, it will also provide wider benefits,\" IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said. The solution, the report suggested, lies in climate resilient development, including integrating measures to adapt to climate change with actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions. For example, access to clean energy and technologies improves health; low-carbon electrification, walking, cycling and public transport enhance air quality, improve health and employment opportunities, and also deliver equity. \"The economic benefits for people's health from air quality improvements alone would be roughly the same, or possibly even larger than the costs of reducing or avoiding emissions,\" the report said. Increasing the input of capital and technology is crucial for achieving a sustainable development, it said. \"There is sufficient global capital to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions if existing barriers are reduced,\" the report said, urging governments to reduce the barriers through public funding and clear signals to investors, while also encouraging investors, central banks and financial regulators to play their part. \"Political commitment, coordinated policies, international cooperation, ecosystem stewardship and inclusive governance are all important for effective and equitable climate action,\" it noted. As climate, ecosystems and society are interconnected, the report stated that effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30 to 50 percent of the Earth's land, freshwater and ocean will help ensure a healthy planet. In that process, urban areas offer a global-scale opportunity for sustainable development. For instance, changes in the food sector, electricity, transport, industry, buildings and land use can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it suggested, which can make it easier for people to lead low-carbon lifestyles, and which in turn also improve health and well-being. \"A better understanding of the consequences of over-consumption can help people make more informed choices.\" \"Transformational changes are more likely to succeed where there is trust, where everyone works together to prioritize risk reduction, and where benefits and burdens are shared equitably,\" Lee said.

And the damage caused by increasingly frequent disasters is taking a toll on the poorest &amp;mdash; those least responsible for climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the ongoing Bonn Climate Change Conference, which began on Monday and will continue till June 16, world leaders must take bold steps to bring about climate justice. More specifically, they must agree to equitably and sufficiently address the loss and damage countries are experiencing as a result of climate change.</p><p>Climate impacts and associated losses and damage are escalating. Flooding in Europe in 2021, for instance, not only claimed the lives of more than 200 people, but also resulted in losses of over $45 billion. In Asia, Super-Typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette) in the Philippines caused more than half a billion dollars in damage. With the increasing frequency of sudden and slow-onset events, the costs of climate impacts will only increase. Estimates of the costs of losses and damage in 2030 are between $290 billion and $580 billion in developing countries alone.</p><p>Despite the growing costs, funding remains woefully inadequate. Oxfam's latest research shows that funding requirements for United Nations humanitarian appeals linked to extreme weather are eight times higher today than they were 20 years ago. Worryingly, our estimates also show that over the past five years, appeals involving extreme weather events were only 54 percent funded on average &amp;mdash; leading to a shortfall of between $28 billion and $33 billion.</p><p>It is rich countries and corporations that are most responsible for carbon emissions and climate change, yet they fail to pay for the harm they have caused and still causing. Rich countries have contributed roughly 92 percent of the excess historical emissions, and are responsible for 37 percent of current emissions.</p><p>On the other hand, the world's poorest countries and communities which are hardest hit by climate change are paying the price for a climate crisis they are least responsible for. Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan, for instance, are together responsible for a mere 0.1 percent of the global emissions, yet people in those countries are facing severe levels of hunger in the midst of flooding and a two-year drought.</p><p>Clearly, current arrangements to make up for the losses and damage are not enough. Not only is there a severe lack of funding, the distribution of finance is also often guided by the preferences and geopolitical concerns of donor governments, and levels of concern within their borders. To effectively address the losses and damage, we need a new finance facility to govern action.</p><p>This requires an elevated central coordinating institution that would ensure the provision of finance is adequate, effective, fair, and guided by principles of climate justice. It would not only house a new fund dedicated to make up for the losses and damage, but, inter alia, also govern the disbursement of finance in a way that is equitable and based on the actual needs of recipient countries.</p><p>A new finance facility alone, however, is not enough. It is crucial that there are also new and innovative sources of finance. These must be equitable and ensure that the highest burden is placed on those most responsible and most able to pay. This could, for example, take the form of a levy on international shipping emissions and frequent flyers.</p><p>Hundreds of billions of dollars could be generated annually for victims of climate change through a tax on fossil fuel extraction. It could look something like the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, which receives contributions from international oil tanker companies and compensates coastal communities affected by oil spills.</p><p>Climate change is a reality we cannot deny. Even if countries take ambitious actions to cut emissions, the consequences of climate change are no longer avoidable. The costs of climate impacts will therefore only continue to skyrocket. The failure to act now, whether in terms of reducing emissions or addressing losses and damage, would spell even greater disaster for the world, especially the poorest people.</p><p>In short, rich countries must take responsibility for the climate damage they have wreaked, and are still wreaking. The world cannot afford to have these countries continue to ignore the harm they are causing to communities facing the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p>The author is director general at Oxfam Hong Kong.</p><p>The views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["cn | Updated: 2022-06-10 10:20From the heat wave in India and Pakistan to the hunger crisis in East Africa, the signs that we are in the middle of a climate emergency are becoming more and more obvious with each passing day.
