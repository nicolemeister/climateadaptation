He said that since the project's inception in January 2021, the joint goal with the AfDB has been to mobilize 25 billion U.S. dollars over five years for adaptation to set the stage for a sustainable, vibrant, and equitable future. Daniel Olago, chairman of the Department of Earth and Climate Sciences at the University of Nairobi, said that the meeting is a commitment to action that is meant to bridge the gap between science, policy, and practical implementation. Olago noted that the project is aimed at scaling up adaptation in Kenya and East Africa's infrastructure resilience through a multistakeholder approach.

He observed that the ripple effects of infrastructure failure due to climate events extend far beyond the immediate hazard zone as they affect everything from healthcare and education to agriculture. \"The infrastructure failures are far more than mere inconveniences since they threaten the very fabric of society and they end up undermining decades of development gains,\" Olago added.

At the core of this drive is the Green Legacy Initiative (GLI), a homegrown tree-planting campaign launched in 2019 to address climate change, environmental degradation, and food security challenges at home and across the region. Now a central pillar of Ethiopia's development and climate adaptation strategy, the annual campaign kicked off on Thursday, with a broad goal of planting 7.5 billion seedlings during the June-September rainy season, pushing the cumulative total beyond 47.5 billion trees. </p><p>To institutionalize progress, Ethiopia took a landmark step in December 2024 when parliament unanimously ratified a proclamation establishing the Green Legacy Initiative and Degraded Land Rehabilitation Special Fund. The legislation earmarks 0.5 to 1 percent of the federal annual budget for restoring degraded landscapes through forestry and agroforestry, with regional states contributing based on capacity. According to the parliamentary motion, the fund is expected to deliver broad social, economic, and ecological benefits while attracting greater international cooperation. Institutionalizing the GLI has elevated Ethiopia's leadership in environmental restoration, serving as a regional and global example for long-term financing and sustainability of climate initiatives. According to a recent study by the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, the GLI has \"significantly reduced\" soil erosion, once a major threat. Previously, an estimated 1.9 billion tonnes of fertile soil were lost annually. Currently, average losses have dropped to 208 million tonnes thanks to the GLI, helping preserve farmland and prevent siltation in dams, according to data from the ministry. The government credits the GLI with strengthening food security, particularly through the planting of fruit trees that contribute to household income, nutrition, and community resilience. The United Nations (UN) also recognized the GLI's contribution to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, targeting zero hunger, through planting high-value fruit trees that enhance food availability. Ethiopia's GLI also aligns with more global climate goals, including SDG 13, which urges urgent climate action. The UN has praised the initiative's \"immense contribution\" to adaptation efforts and its alignment with the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the African Union's Agenda 2063. The GLI is also inspiring regional action. Nigerian Vice President Kashim Shettima, who joined this year's tree-planting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, hailed it as \"an inclusive, impactful, and visionary model,\" urging African countries to follow Ethiopia's lead. Shettima also called the initiative a practical and inspiring response to the climate crisis, with wide-ranging benefits for land restoration, agricultural productivity, and job creation. Experts and policymakers argue that through the GLI, Ethiopia is demonstrating that large-scale, nationally-led climate action is both achievable and essential for securing a stable future in the Horn of Africa and beyond.

It is about deciding whether the Amazon will be a sovereignty managed as a strategic asset by the countries that compose it, or be treated as a bargaining chip in a game dominated by tariffs, sanctions and major power disputes. The US administration's rhetoric about \"protecting the climate\", opportunistically invoked when convenient, does not withstand honest scrutiny: its policies prioritize the immediate economic advantage of the US, even if that means derailing environmental agreements.</p><p>In this context, Brazil plays a critical role. Lula has already shown a willingness to lead the climate debate, restoring multilateral commitments and placing forest protection at the center of his diplomacy. But leadership requires more than fine speeches; it demands building strategic alliances with Amazonian countries, strengthening green-finance mechanisms without hidden traps, and resisting the commercial blackmail of the superpower. The COP30 presidency is a unique opportunity to show that the Global South is not condemned to be a spectator to decisions made in the Global North.</p><p>The US' tariff war against BRICS is not an isolated chapter in US foreign policy; it is part of a broader strategy to preserve US hegemony in an increasingly multipolar world. The Amazon, with its climate and economic significance, is one of the stages on which this struggle plays out. If the region's countries do not take the lead, they risk having their future decided behind closed doors \u2014 and not in Bel\u00e9m, in front of the world.</p><p>The challenge is to turn COP30 into a counterpoint to this logic. Instead of accepting the narrative that global trade and environmental protection are incompatible goals, the Amazonian countries and their BRICS partners should demonstrate that it is both possible and urgent to integrate economic development with preservation. The US' tariff war, paradoxically, may serve as a catalyst for a new climate alliance, uniting those who refuse to choose between prosperity and protecting the planet.</p><p>The author is an economist, retired professor at the University of Bras\u00edlia and member of the Brazilian Association of Economists for Democracy.</p><p>The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202508/20/68a4fc4ca3109bd7e5269a2b.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202508/20/68a4fc4ca3109bd7e5269a2d.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>LI MIN/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "China Daily European Edition", "instances": ["The Amazon rainforest enters this geopolitical chessboard subtly, yet decisively.

Around him, the once-lush trees now look brittle and sunburned, their leaves yellowing and curling inwards. \"This is unlike anything we've ever seen,\" Abdallah says. \"The springs are dry. </p><p>The rivers are gone. Even the wells can't help us now.\" Lebanon, renowned for its varied climate and plentiful natural springs, is now facing an unprecedented drought, with rainfall levels plummeting by over 60 percent during the 2024-2025 season. According to Lebanon's Agricultural Research Institute, snowfall was almost nonexistent this year in several mountainous regions, and even where snow did fall, it melted rapidly -- failing to replenish the country's rivers, springs, and underground reservoirs. In a recent statement, Lebanon's Ministry of Energy and Water confirmed that rainfall dropped by 40 percent this year, impacting both surface and underground water sources. \"Lebanon is in the grip of a severe drought not seen in over six decades,\" said Kamal Khair, a Lebanese geologist. \"This is not a one-off dry season. This is a new climate pattern driven by global warming and compounded by poor local preparedness.\" As humidity levels decline and typical winter storms pass by, Lebanon's vital water sources -- including the iconic springs of Al-Biyada, Hasbani, and Al-Yamouna -- have completely dried up. Farmers like Abdallah are among the most severely affected. His fruit trees, once abundant with cherries and apricots, now struggle to survive. \"In the past, we relied on rain, wells, and natural springs,\" he explains. \"This year, there is nothing. Our lands are thirsty, and so are we.\" Further north in the Bekaa Valley, Hussein Darwish, another farmer, laments a devastating loss, \"I used to make 25,000 U.S. dollars a year from my orchard. This year, I barely made 5,000 dollars. I've lost 80 percent of my apricot and cherry harvest.\" A sharp spike in fuel prices -- with diesel climbing by 3 dollars in less than three weeks -- has only worsened the situation, making well irrigation prohibitively expensive. The Hasbani River, once one of Lebanon's vital waterways, has nearly vanished. In a last-ditch effort to rescue its remaining aquatic life, local mayor Labib Al-Hamra and a group of environmental volunteers launched a campaign to relocate surviving fish from the river's shrinking pools to the still-flowing Hasbani spring upstream. \"Whole stretches of the river have gone dry,\" Al-Hamra said. \"Irrigation has stopped, fish are dying, and over a hundred riverside businesses -- from resorts to restaurants -- have been crippled.\" The Litani River, Lebanon's longest, has also seen a sharp drop in water flow into Lake Qaraoun, the country's largest artificial lake. According to Sami Alawieh, head of the Litani River Authority, water levels have dropped to below 60 million cubic meters -- far short of the seasonal average of 233 million. This decline has led to the closure of a nearby hydroelectric plant, worsening Lebanon's already severe electricity crisis. A recent UN report warns that over 1.2 million people in Lebanon may soon lose access to safe drinking water unless urgent action is taken. Meanwhile, water tankers have become both scarce and expensive, making clean water a luxury in many rural and urban communities. Amidst the unprecedented drought, local experts are urging the government to take measures. \"Lebanon can no longer depend on outdated water policies,\" said Khair. \"Without immediate investment in water infrastructure, drought resilience, and climate adaptation, the crisis will deepen.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["Amidst the unprecedented drought, local experts are urging the government to take measures. \"Lebanon can no longer depend on outdated water policies,\" said Khair.

This conference is seen as a key moment to resolve one of the world's worst humanitarian tragedies. It is expected to be convened by Ambassador Philemon Yang, president of the United Nations General Assembly. But success will depend on more than speeches; it must lead to real, lasting action. </p><p>The Rohingya people, mostly Muslims, have suffered for years. About 1 million fled to Bangladesh after violent attacks in 2017. Another 600,000 remain in Myanmar, living in poverty and fear. They have been denied citizenship and basic rights. Many face food shortages, forced military recruitment and other atrocities. Their future remains uncertain. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

There, Bangladesh's Chief Adviser, Muhammad Yunus, called for global action. A UN resolution followed, and Bangladesh has since played a key role. </p><p>Myanmar's internal situation has only worsened. Since a military coup in 2021, more than 6,000 civilians have died. According to a local monitoring group, about 22,000 people have been jailed for political reasons. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/video/asia/3304322/powerful-magnitude-77-earthquake-strikes-myanmar-buildings-sway-and-fall-bangkok\">A major earthquake in March this year</url> brought no pause to the violence. Civil war continues, and the military junta refuses to step back. Amid the chaos, the Rohingya are more vulnerable than ever. </p><p>To succeed, the conference must meet four urgent goals. First, it must set a clear and enforceable plan for the Rohingya to return home safely and with dignity. This means deadlines, international oversight and strong guarantees. </p><p>Second, it must solve the root problem: the Rohingya must be recognised as citizens of Myanmar. Without legal rights, no return will be meaningful. </p><p>Third, aid must reach those still in Rakhine state. Countries like China and Asean members must help ensure humanitarian access. </p><p>Fourth, the international community must pressure Myanmar's military. This includes sanctions, diplomatic isolation and strong, united messaging from UN and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3312024/concerned-asean-leaders-fail-issue-fresh-condemnation-myanmars-junta\">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</url> envoys. </p><p>Most importantly, Rohingya voices must be included in all decisions. Their future cannot be decided without them. Major global powers, including the US, China and the European Union, must stop avoiding hard choices. The cost of inaction is too great.

UNEP's Adaptation Gap Report 2024, titled \"Come Hell and High Water,\" said that climate emergencies have escalated, necessitating urgent action to strengthen coping mechanisms for vulnerable communities in the Global South. </p><p>The report was launched ahead of the 29th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change summit, scheduled to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from Nov. 11-22. The report warned that climate-linked disasters are pushing the planet toward a precipice while increasing adaptation financing is essential to securing a resilient and greener future for communities. UNEP's Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the failure to increase adaptation measures has undermined responses to climatic shocks, harming the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable populations. \"Well-financed and effective adaptation that incorporates fairness and equity is more urgent than ever,\" Andersen said, adding that adaptation financing should be more anticipatory and strategic, rather than reactive. According to the report, international public adaptation finance flows to developing countries rose from 22 billion U.S. dollars in 2021 to 28 billion dollars in 2022. At the UN climate summit held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, developed nations agreed to double adaptation finance for developing counterparts to at least 38 billion dollars by 2025. The report said that developing countries are grappling with shrinking fiscal space, debt burdens and rising inflation, limiting their ability to secure sufficient funds for adapting to the climate crisis. \"As climate impacts rise with warming, both the costs of reducing risks through adaptation and the likelihood of the residual risks manifesting in the form of losses and damages increase,\" the report said. According to the report, 171 countries have at least one adaptation policy or strategy in place, while 16 of the 26 countries without any plan are in the Global South, including those classified as fragile. To unlock adaptation finance, the report called for fiscal and regulatory incentives, de-risking private sector investments, and exploring innovative financing instruments such as performance-based grants, resilience credits and bonds, debt-for-adaptation swaps, and payment for ecosystem services.

We utilised the pixel dichotomy method to derive FVC from MODIS13A2 data (2000-2023) within the Google Earth Engine platform. To evaluate the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation restoration, we applied slope trend analysis in conjunction with the Mann-Kendall mutation test. Results (1) From 2000 to 2023, Vegetation Restoration in Fujian Province exhibited pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Approximately 72.65% of the region exhibited an increasing trend in FVC, with over 80% of the study area maintaining moderate to high levels of vegetation cover. In contrast, the southeastern coastal areas showed slower gains. (2) Approximately 69.55% of the changes in vegetation cover were attributed to the combined influence of human activities and climate change, with human activities contributing more significantly to vegetation restoration than climate change (67.88% vs. 64.14%). (3) Within the 40%-100% contribution range, the proportion of areas where human activities predominantly influenced changes in FVC was higher than that influenced by climate change (69.89% vs. 51.12%). (4) Although the total area of forests, shrublands and grasslands in Fujian Province declined during this period, the overall increase in FVC underscores the effectiveness of ecological restoration programs such as the Grain for Green Initiative.

While U.S. officials denied any governmental responsibility, international experts said the catastrophe has highlighted significant and persistent weaknesses in America's disaster preparedness, climate adaptation, and institutional response. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe under climate change, experts warn that without comprehensive investment in early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and science-based policy, such tragedies may become the \"new normal.\" WARNING CHAIN BREAKS: \"LAST MILE\" COMMUNICATION FAILURE The tragedy has exposed what international experts call the \"last mile\" problem in disaster communications - the critical gap between when warnings are issued and when vulnerable populations receive and act upon them. </p><p>This downpour appears to have been well forecasted by multiple agencies worldwide, several hours in advance. Warnings were issued, but the systems do not seem to have been in place to deliver information quickly enough to those in harm's way. Hannah Cloke, professor of the University of Reading, emphasized that \"an alert system is a chain of human communication, and if one person in any part of the chain doesn't respond as they should to take action, the system runs the risk of failure.\" Recordings of radio traffic reviewed by CBS News reveal that a firefighter, about an hour into the flood response at 4:22 a.m., asked a dispatcher if the CodeRED system could be activated. \"The crux of this disaster is a failure of the last mile of communication,\" said Tom Fahy, the legislative director of a National Weather Service union. \"The forecasts went out, they communicated the forecasts, they disseminated the watches and warnings. And the dilemma we have is there was nobody listening at 4 o'clock in the morning for these watches and warnings.\" SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS OVERLOOKED, WEAKENING DISASTER RESPONSE Despite persistent skepticism from the Trump administration regarding climate change, the scientific community has long warned that a warmer, wetter climate is making extreme weather events like floods both more frequent and more destructive. \"There has been an explosion in extreme weather in recent years, including more devastating flash floods caused by slow-moving, wetter storms that dump exceptional amounts of rain over small areas in a short time,\" said Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of Geophysical &amp; Climate Hazards at University College London. \"Such events will only become more commonplace as the global temperature continues to climb, driven by carbon dioxide emissions that still top 40 billion tonnes every year.\" Yet, the U.S. government has significantly reduced funding for climate research and cut positions at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS). According to Scientific American, key NWS offices serving the hardest-hit Texas communities have been operating with critical vacancies, including the absence of warning coordination meteorologists - positions essential for translating forecasts into actionable plans for local authorities. The Guardian quoted Samantha Montano, professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, as saying: \"This is what happens when you let climate change run unabated and break apart the emergency management system - without investing in that system at the local and state level.\" LONG-TERM INVESTMENT FAILURES LEAVE COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE As reported by the Houston Chronicle, Kerr County, which was at the heart of the disaster, had considered installing a flood warning system eight years ago but abandoned the plan due to a lack of state funding. Experts stress that emergency response alone is not enough to address climate risk. Systematic, long-term approaches to flood resilience are needed. The tragedy in Kerr County highlights the social vulnerability and chronic underinvestment in infrastructure and emergency management that left communities exposed. The Texas floods \"need to be reviewed, both from a forecast and warning perspective and from a decision support perspective,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini.

As two major forces committed to building a multipolar world, China and the European Union have always called for global climate governance based on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Since \"green\" is the hallmark of China-EU cooperation, the two sides agree on climate action, ecological preservation and environmental protection.</p><p>In stark contrast to China and the EU, the United States has been taking unilateral actions detrimental to not only global climate governance but also the natural environment. For example, on July 4, the US passed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\", which will undermine the country's energy transition as well as global climate cooperation. The bill deals another blow to the global fight against climate change, especially as the US has once again begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement \u2014 a reversal of the previous administration's decision to rejoin it.</p><p>Against such a background, strengthening China-EU climate cooperation has become even more important.</p><p>For a long time, both China and the EU have attached great importance to fighting climate change, launching a series of productive policy dialogues and engaging in practical cooperation. From hosting the Global Sustainable Transport Forum to establishing the China-Europe carbon neutrality research center, from the zero-emissions vessels in Northern European ports to the industrial parks producing solar panels in the Iberian Peninsula, China-EU cooperation on green development has been advancing in both depth and latitude.</p><p>The latest China-EU joint statement on climate change further stresses the need for the two sides to deepen cooperation in areas such as energy transition, climate adaptation, carbon market, and green and low-carbon technology.</p><p>But such cooperation comes with challenges due to the EU's lack of real concern for the Global South as a major development force. On July 23, just a day before the China-EU Summit, the International Court of Justice delivered its first advisory opinion on climate change, asserting that countries have a legal obligation to protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and mend the resulting damage. The case saw the highest level of participation from the international community in the ICJ's history, with 91 written statements and 62 written comments filed in the Registry by States and international organizations, including China and the EU.</p><p>Despite claiming to be a \"green flagbearer\", the EU targeted developing countries including China in the written statement it submitted to the court. It claimed that climate mitigation obligations of all the state parties to the Paris Agreement have changed the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also said the principle is based on the different national circumstances of the states, but not on developed countries' responsibility for historical emissions, so the countries with enhanced capacity should shoulder more responsibility for reducing emissions, and provide financial assistance for less-developed economies.</p><p>Blurring the line between developed and developing countries, the EU intends to transfer the responsibility of reducing emissions and providing financial assistance from the Global North to the emerging market economies such as China. Unfortunately, the EU's contention influenced the ICJ's final opinion. Although the court recognized common but differentiated responsibilities as the guiding principle directly applicable to climate change, it held that the principle does not call for assigning new responsibilities to countries.</p><p>This is to say, the ICJ fell short of analyzing how the principle provides meaningful guidance for the interpretation of treaties, limiting the effectiveness of the principle merely to the nominal level.</p><p>The ICJ's advisory opinion is a mirror that reflects the power imbalance between the Global North and the Global South in making global climate governance rules, which is unfair to the Global South.</p><p>Studies show that about 90 percent of the excessive carbon emissions come from developed countries, with developing countries, especially least-developed and small island developing countries, being disproportionally affected by climate change. Worse, they lack the needed technology and financial support to cope with the challenge. These countries need global cooperation, including technology transfer and financial assistance from the developed economies, to combat climate change. And it is the common but differentiated responsibilities principle that lays the foundation of global cooperation.</p><p>As part of the Global South, China has been emphasizing the key role of the common but differentiated responsibilities principle in global climate governance. In its written statement, China said the essence of global climate governance based on the UNFCCC is to stress the legal obligation of \"differentiation\": Article 3 of the convention refers to \"common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\", thus establishing the primacy of the principle, with the Nationally Determined Contributions clause of the Paris Agreement further developing it.</p><p>It's time the Global South amplified its collective voice in global climate governance to counter West-centrism. This is necessary for democratizing the global climate governance system, and prompting the international community to make global climate governance more effective by adhering to the China-proposed principles: extensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefit.

Formally known as the 62nd session of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB62), the 11-day meetings focus on finalizing indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), a key commitment under the Paris Agreement to \"enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.\" Other major agenda items include advancing a just transition, outlining a pathway to mobilize 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars in climate finance, and maintaining momentum on mitigation efforts. A just transition refers to ensuring that the shift to a low-carbon economy is fair and inclusive, particularly for workers and communities most affected. </p><p>Climate finance involves funding, mainly from developed to developing countries, to support both emissions reduction and climate adaptation. Mitigation efforts focus on cutting greenhouse gas emissions to help limit global warming. The UN June Climate Meetings are held usually every year to serve as a technical and political preparatory platform for the annual Conference of the Parties (COP). According to the UNFCCC, SB62 is expected to build on the outcomes of COP29, advance negotiations on key issues, and lay the groundwork for decisions to be adopted at COP30 in Belem, Brazil, this November. As negotiators gather to push forward climate commitments, long-standing questions of historical responsibility continue to shape the global climate agenda. Greenhouse gas emissions began to surge with industrialization in the West. For decades, developed countries pursued rapid but resource-intensive growth, emitting large volumes of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. From the Industrial Revolution to 1950, they were responsible for approximately 95 percent of cumulative global emissions. A 2023 study led by the University of Leeds further found that even nearly 90 percent of excess carbon emissions currently can be attributed to developed countries, with the United States among the leading contributors. Against this backdrop, the absence of a U.S. delegation at SB62 has drawn particular attention. As the world's historically largest CO2 emitter, the United States has left its seats in the plenary hall empty, with no official delegates seen in Bonn so far. In a move that has sparked global concern, U.S. President Donald Trump, on his first day back in the White House this January, signed an executive order to withdraw his country from the Paris climate accord for the second time, raising further uncertainty about the U.S. role in multilateral climate action.

By integrating multi-model climate simulations with geological records, the team found consistent trends: monsoon rainfall tends to increase overall, while circulation weakens over the Bay of Bengal but strengthens over the northern Arabian Sea.

Scientists have widely agreed that the persistent rise in greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution is the primary driver of this year's intense heatwaves.<br/>The still-unbroken trend of rising temperatures, largely attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, has led to record-high sea surface temperatures, further warming the lower atmosphere, Andreas Walter, spokesperson for the German Meteorological Service, has told Xinhua.<br/>Heatwaves are often triggered and sustained by stationary high-pressure systems, sometimes referred to as \"heat domes.\" These systems trap hot air near the surface and block the formation of cooling clouds and precipitation, leading to prolonged periods of extreme heat, Nicolas explained.<br/>In Britain, a persistent high-pressure zone has led to parched soils and rising surface temperatures, intensifying the heatwave's impact.<br/><br/><br/>Another contributing factor is the transition from El Nino to La Nina, which can weaken the West African monsoon and shift hot tropical air northward into Europe. This process supports the persistence of high-pressure systems and prolongs heat and drought conditions.<br/>In the United States, heat waves are the deadliest form of extreme weather. The current wave is particularly concerning, as it marks the first of the season yet brings temperatures more typical of midsummer, not June. Affecting around 150 million people from Wisconsin to WashingtonD.C., this event bears all the hallmarks of human-induced climate change.<br/>Simultaneously, Europe is experiencing similarly searing temperatures, also intensified by global warming. In Slovenia, average temperatures have risen by about two degrees Celsius since 1961, doubling the global average and leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves.<br/>Aemet, Spain's national weather agency, has issued a special warning, forecasting highs of up to 42 degrees Celsius in the country's southern regions in the coming days. In neighbouring Portugal, around two-thirds of the country will be placed under high alert on Sunday due to extreme temperatures and the risk of wildfires. Lisbon could see highs of 42 degrees Celsius.<br/>In Italy, where cities such as Naples and Palermo are bracing for 39 degrees Celsius, the regions of Sicily and Liguria have introduced bans on outdoor work during the hottest parts of the day.<br/><br/>According to the World Meteorological Organization, Asia is warming at nearly twice the global average. This rapid warming has fueled a series of record-breaking and unusually early heat waves in 2025.<br/>Earlier this month, India's capital, New Delhi-home to over 30 million people, is facing a historic heatwave, prompting the India Meteorological Department to issue a red alert. Temperatures in several areas are soaring 41-45 degrees Celsius, surpassing long-term averages by three to four degrees.<br/>Meanwhile, in Pakistan's Punjab region, temperatures have reached 50 degrees Celsius, a level considered \"close to the survival threshold.\"<br/>WIDESPREAD CONSEQUENCES<br/>\"Through its influence on extreme heat, human-induced climate change puts a massive burden on societies, leading to thousands of premature deaths and severe strain on infrastructure and ecosystems,\" said Fredi Otto, lead scientist at the World Weather Attribution project. \"It also causes significant agricultural losses and reductions in productivity.\"<br/>Moreover, their impact on public health and vital sectors continues to escalate. According to a real-time analysis in 2025 by the London School of Hygiene &amp;Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London, an estimated 570 people in England and Wales may have died due to high temperatures between June 19 and June 22.<br/>Health authorities have issued warnings as temperatures near 39 degrees Celsius in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, with some regions experiencing their driest June on record. Hospitals are reporting rising cases of heatstroke, dehydration, and cardiovascular issues. Public officials are urging residents to stay hydrated, limit outdoor activities, and care for vulnerable neighbors.<br/><br/>The agricultural sector is also under acute stress. In many parts of Europe, prolonged drought and extreme heat have left soils dangerously dry, threatening major crops such as corn and sunflower and reducing grain yields, including barley. Forests are also vulnerable to wildfires and pest outbreaks, exacerbated by warmer winters.<br/>HungaroMet's June 2025 agrometeorological report highlights extreme drought across large areas of Hungary. In central and southeastern regions of the country, rainfall since March has been 40-100 mm below average. Topsoil moisture is below 20 percent in most areas, with corn and sunflower leaves curling, and even early-harvested barley is suffering.<br/>Infrastructure systems are also being tested. Roads and railways are buckling under heat stress, power grids face surging electricity demand, and many regions are grappling with water shortages.<br/>The economic toll is growing. The World Bank warns that, if current trends continue, extreme heat could reduce annual GDP in European and Central Asian cities by up to 2.5 percent by 2050.<br/>URGENT MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION MEASURES NEEDED<br/>Governments and communities are intensifying efforts to protect public health and adapt to a rapidly warming climate. In Britain, amber weather alerts have been issued alongside widespread public messaging on heat safety.<br/>Local councils are proactively checking on vulnerable residents and opening cooling centers. Across Europe, similar measures are underway. Slovenia has activated emergency protocols, extended pool hours, and disseminated health guidance through multiple channels.<br/>Experts stress that while short-term responses are crucial, long-term adaptation is even more essential. \"Cities, in particular, must implement measures to mitigate the impact of heatwaves, such as increasing urban greenery and providing shaded areas,\" said Andreas Walter.<br/>Urban greening, reflective surfaces, and climate-conscious architecture are increasingly promoted as key strategies to combat the urban heat island effect.<br/>At the policy level, some countries are making progress. Slovenia, for example, is incorporating climate adaptation into national planning, with a focus on infrastructure, water resource management, and disaster risk reduction. Still, experts caution that adaptation alone is not enough.<br/>\"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains essential to limit the worsening extremes of weather for future generations, but there is also an urgent need to improve our preparedness for more severe hot, dry but also wet weather extremes as the climate continues to warm,\" said Richard Allan.</p>", "publisher": "People's Daily Online - English", "instances": ["Urban greening, reflective surfaces, and climate-conscious architecture are increasingly promoted as key strategies to combat the urban heat island effect.

As the Northern Hemisphere endures a summer of unprecedented heat, experts warn that these extreme events are not isolated anomalies, but stark evidence of accelerating climate change. From Europe to North America and Asia, the impacts are straining societies, economies, and ecosystems, prompting urgent calls for both immediate adaptation and long-term mitigation. DRIVERS OF EXTREME WARMTH \"These are separate events, not a single heatwave event sweeping across the Northern Hemisphere,\" said Julien Nicolas, senior scientist at the Copernicus Climate Change Service. </p><p>\"Affected regions are often separated by areas with colder-than-average conditions.\" Despite their geographic separation, these events share a common underlying cause -- human-induced climate change. Scientists have widely agreed that the persistent rise in greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution is the primary driver of this year's intense heatwaves. The still-unbroken trend of rising temperatures due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases has led to record-high sea surface temperatures, further warming the lower atmosphere, Andreas Walter, spokesperson for the German Meteorological Service, has told Xinhua. Heatwaves are often triggered and sustained by stationary high-pressure systems, sometimes referred to as \"heat domes.\" These systems trap hot air near the surface and block the formation of cooling clouds and precipitation, leading to prolonged periods of extreme heat, Nicolas explained. In the United Kingdom, a persistent high-pressure zone has led to parched soils and rising surface temperatures, intensifying the heatwave's impact. Another contributing factor is the transition from El Nino to La Nina, which can weaken the West African monsoon and shift hot tropical air northward into Europe. This process supports the persistence of high-pressure systems and prolongs heat and drought conditions. In the United States, heatwaves are the deadliest form of extreme weather. The current wave is particularly concerning, as it marks the first of the season yet brings temperatures more typical of midsummer, not June. Affecting around 150 million people from Wisconsin to WashingtonD.C., this event bears all the hallmarks of human-induced climate change. Simultaneously, Europe is experiencing similarly searing temperatures, also intensified by global warming. In Slovenia, average temperatures there have risen by about two degrees Celsius since 1961, doubling the global average and making heatwaves both more frequent and more severe. Aemet, Spain's national weather agency, has issued a special warning, forecasting highs of up to 42 degrees Celsius in the country's southern regions in the coming days. In neighbouring Portugal, around two-thirds of the country will be placed under high alert on Sunday due to extreme temperatures and the risk of wildfires. Lisbon could see highs of 42 degrees Celsius. In Italy, where cities such as Naples and Palermo are bracing for 39 degrees Celsius heat, the regions of Sicily and Liguria have introduced bans on outdoor work during the hottest parts of the day. According to the World Meteorological Organization, Asia is warming at nearly twice the global average. This rapid warming has fueled a series of record-breaking and unusually early heatwaves in 2025. Earlier this month, India's capital, New Delhi-home to over 30 million people, is facing a historic heatwave, prompting the India Meteorological Department to issue a red alert. Temperatures in several areas are soaring 41-45 degrees Celsius, surpassing long-term averages by three to four degrees. Meanwhile, in Pakistan's Punjab region, temperatures have reached 50 degrees Celsius, a level considered \"close to the survival threshold.\" WIDESPREAD CONSEQUENCES \"Through its influence on extreme heat, human-induced climate change puts a massive burden on societies, leading to thousands of premature deaths and severe strain on infrastructure and ecosystems,\" said Fredi Otto, lead scientist at the World Weather Attribution project. \"It also causes significant agricultural losses and reductions in productivity.\" Moreover, their impact on public health and vital sectors continues to escalate. According to a real-time analysis in 2025 by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London, an estimated 570 people in England and Wales may have died due to high temperatures between June 19 and June 22. Health authorities have issued warnings as temperatures near 39 degrees Celsius in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, with some regions experiencing their driest June on record. Hospitals are reporting rising cases of heatstroke, dehydration, and cardiovascular issues. Public officials are urging residents to stay hydrated, limit outdoor activities, and care for vulnerable neighbors. The agricultural sector is also under acute stress. In many parts o Europe, prolonged drought and extreme heat have left soils dangerously dry, threatening major crops such as corn and sunflower and reducing grain yields, including barley. Forests are also vulnerable to wildfires and pest outbreaks, exacerbated by warmer winters. HungaroMet's June 2025 agrometeorological report highlights extreme drought across large areas of Hungary. In central and southeastern regions of the country, rainfall since March has been 40-100 mm below average. Topsoil moisture is below 20 percent in most areas, with corn and sunflower leaves curling, and even early-harvested barley is suffering. Infrastructure systems are also being tested. Roads and railways are buckling under heat stress, power grids face surging electricity demand, and many regions are grappling with water shortages. The economic toll is growing. The World Bank warns that, if current trends continue, extreme heat could reduce annual GDP in European and Central Asian cities by up to 2.5 percent by 2050. URGENT MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION MEASURES NEEDED Governments and communities are intensifying efforts to protect public health and adapt to a rapidly warming climate. In the UK, amber weather alerts have been issued alongside widespread public messaging on heat safety. Local councils are proactively checking on vulnerable residents and opening cooling centers. Across Europe, similar measures are underway, Slovenia has activated emergency protocols, extended pool hours, and disseminated health guidance through multiple channels. Experts stress that while short-term responses are crucial, long-term adaptation is even more essential. \"Cities, in particular, must implement measures to mitigate the impact of heatwaves, such as increasing urban greenery and providing shaded areas,\" said Andreas Walter. Urban greening, reflective surfaces, and climate-conscious architecture are increasingly promoted as key strategies to combat the urban heat island effect. At the policy level, some countries are making progress. Slovenia, for example, is incorporating climate adaptation into national planning, with a focus on infrastructure, water resource management, and disaster risk reduction. Still, experts caution that adaptation alone is not enough. \"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains essential to limit the worsening extremes of weather for future generations, but there is also an urgent need to improve our preparedness for more severe hot, dry but also wet weather extremes as the climate continues to warm,\" said Richard Allan.

By using geographically weighted regression and spatial autocorrelation analysis, we systematically explore the spatiotemporal effects and mechanisms of multi-dimensional urban morphology characteristics on regional thermal effects. We found the following points. (1) Built-up land patch density is significantly positively correlated with LST, with the urban heat island (UHI) effect spreading from core areas to the periphery; this corroborates the thermal environment differentiation features under the 'multi-center, networked' spatial planning pattern of the GBA. (2) Outlying expansion mitigates local LST rise through an ecological isolation effect, and infill expansion significantly exacerbates the UHI effect due to high-intensity development, reflecting the differentiated impacts of various expansion patterns on the thermal environment.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"(3) LCZ spatial distribution aligns closely with regional planning, with the solar radiation shading effect of high-rise buildings significantly cooling daytime LSTs, whereas the thermal storage properties of traditional building materials and human heat sources cause nighttime LST increases; this reveals the deep influence of urban morphology mechanisms, building materials, and human activities on thermal environments.

As a leading emerging donor, China leverages its distinct differentiated institutional engagement and South-South cooperation experience to advance a development governance paradigm diverging from traditional Western approaches. It contends that South-South cooperation should not be incorporated into the Development Assistance Committee-led GPEDC accountability framework. Instead, it advocates establishing differentiated responsibility frameworks \u2014 guided by the \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" principle \u2014 that align with individual nations' developmental stages and capacities. This stance reconciles recognition of South-South cooperation's distinctive character with constructive engagement in global rule-making.</p><p>Furthermore, China has demonstrated its increasing commitment to institutional transparency through the publication of its Foreign Aid White Paper, disclosure of assistance information, and establishment of cooperative mechanisms. Concurrently within the South-South cooperation framework, China actively advances innovation in multilateral governance.

The UN Development Cooperation Forum and the GPEDC \u2014 as dual anchors for global development cooperation \u2014 require a permanent coordination mechanism for the implementation and accountability for the global sustainable development goals. Moreover, the two platforms should jointly develop a Global Dashboard on Effective Development Cooperation. By consolidating their respective evaluation data and experiential reports, the dashboard would enhance the integration, complementarity and synergy between policies and practices.</p><p>Second, a differentiated responsibility mechanism should be set up. It should respect varying development stages and encourage emerging donors to participate in the development effectiveness system. The GPEDC's monitoring system must transition from its current rigid, uniform standards to a capability-based tiered structure. This involves setting differential participation and indicator priorities based on a country's development phase. For example, China could initially participate in the monitoring indicators related to \"transparency improvement\" while maintaining flexibility in fiscal predictability. Meanwhile, emerging donor countries should be encouraged to create their own evaluation standards, and participate in global development cooperation through a \"voluntary reporting+international comparison \"approach. To ensure fairness and inclusiveness, they are also encouraged to build their local monitoring capabilities by providing assessment templates and technical assistance.</p><p>Third, revitalizing trust mechanisms in North-South development cooperation is critical to restore its geopolitical foundation. Traditional OECD donors must substantively recommit to development effectiveness and provide financial and political support under the GPEDC framework. Concurrently, strategic pilot initiatives for functional cooperation between the traditional and emerging donor countries should be launched to create joint funding facilities for humanitarian aid, climate adaptation and global health to cultivate trust via outcome-focused collaboration. Complementing these efforts, the United Nations should lead the efforts to institutionalize tripartite dialogue platforms that synchronize development agendas, thereby enhancing systemic resilience in multilateral cooperation.</p><p>Fourth, the GPEDC must undertake institutional reforms to accommodate Global South countries in global development governance for joint contributions and shared benefits. Concrete steps should include: overhauling the GPEDC's governance structure by forming a global development cooperation executive committee in which Global South countries hold the majority and can steer agenda-setting and evaluation. In addition, cultural adaptability indicators should be incorporated into the monitoring mechanism to acknowledge the diverse approaches of South-South cooperation and reflect a more equitable and pluralistic assessment criteria.</p><p>Future global development governance should not be subject to Western powers, and should instead promote establishing more equitable, diverse and adaptive international mechanisms. Only by dismantling structural constraints and building a consultative and inclusive governance system can we realize the global partnership for development pledged in the UN 2030 Agenda and achieve its sustainable development goals.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202506/18/6851f458a310ad67bd26ad09.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Huang Meibo</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202506/18/6851f458a310ad67bd26ad0b.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Ying Lingrong</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202506/18/6851f458a310ad67bd26ad0d.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Huang Meibo is director and professor at the International Development Cooperation Academy at Shanghai University of International Business and Economics.

To ensure fairness and inclusiveness, they are also encouraged to build their local monitoring capabilities by providing assessment templates and technical assistance.</p><p>Third, revitalizing trust mechanisms in North-South development cooperation is critical to restore its geopolitical foundation. Traditional OECD donors must substantively recommit to development effectiveness and provide financial and political support under the GPEDC framework. Concurrently, strategic pilot initiatives for functional cooperation between the traditional and emerging donor countries should be launched to create joint funding facilities for humanitarian aid, climate adaptation and global health to cultivate trust via outcome-focused collaboration. Complementing these efforts, the United Nations should lead the efforts to institutionalize tripartite dialogue platforms that synchronize development agendas, thereby enhancing systemic resilience in multilateral cooperation.</p><p>Fourth, the GPEDC must undertake institutional reforms to accommodate Global South countries in global development governance for joint contributions and shared benefits. Concrete steps should include: overhauling the GPEDC's governance structure by forming a global development cooperation executive committee in which Global South countries hold the majority and can steer agenda-setting and evaluation. In addition, cultural adaptability indicators should be incorporated into the monitoring mechanism to acknowledge the diverse approaches of South-South cooperation and reflect a more equitable and pluralistic assessment criteria.</p><p>Future global development governance should not be subject to Western powers, and should instead promote establishing more equitable, diverse and adaptive international mechanisms. Only by dismantling structural constraints and building a consultative and inclusive governance system can we realize the global partnership for development pledged in the UN 2030 Agenda and achieve its sustainable development goals.</p><p>Huang Meibo is director and professor at the International Development Cooperation Academy at Shanghai University of International Business and Economics.

Indonesia saw coconut prices increase by 57 per cent year on year in May, and the same has been true in the Philippines since late 2024. Prices have more than doubled in both Thailand and Vietnam. This surge was driven by an increase in coconut exports, particularly to China. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a home to several of the world's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3092482/no-monkey-abuse-here-say-thai-coconut-farmers-animal-rights\">coconut powerhouses</url>, the price surge represents both opportunity and crisis for Southeast Asia. The region's aggressive export push has succeeded beyond expectations. Unfortunately, this export-driven price surge, while representing an opportunity, has helped create domestic shortages. </p><p>At the same time, 98 per cent of all coconut production in the region is contributed by smallholders who face a dilemma of their own. Many lack the resources to capitalise on the price surge. Ageing trees require replacement, but new palms take years to reach full production. Without sufficient financing, better agricultural practices and protection from exploitative middlemen, even historically high prices will fail to lift many smallholders out of poverty. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>The disconnect between commodity prices and smallholders' welfare reveals a fundamental injustice plaguing the industry. Most of the industry is smallholders who manage less than two hectares. They earn little and, after spending on inputs, labour and transport, have even smaller profits. </p><p>This systemic undervaluation stems from decades of neglect. Unlike staple crops such as rice or lucrative exports <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3302424/malaysia-peddles-premium-palm-oil-china-overall-imports-decline\">such as palm oil</url>, the coconut has historically been treated as the unloved orphan of Southeast Asian agriculture. </p><p>The contrast with palm oil is particularly stark. Indonesia's palm oil industry receives substantial government subsidies, tax breaks and investment. These advantages, coupled with palm oil's higher yields per hectare, have driven rapid expansion which directly threatens coconut cultivation. </p><p>Even where coconut cultivation persists, declining productivity threatens its viability. An estimated 90 per cent of coconut trees across Southeast Asia are past their productive prime. Older coconut trees yield less, further reducing overall productivity. Replanting would restore productivity, but the long wait for new trees to mature presents a financial barrier few smallholders can overcome without assistance. </p><p>The problem of ageing trees is compounded by climate-related challenges. In the Philippines, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3224387/how-el-nino-threatening-chinas-food-security-drive\">El Nino-fuelled droughts</url> slashed coconut yields by an estimated 20 per cent in 2024 alone. In the past three years, more than 3 million coconut trees have been ripped out by intensifying typhoons. </p><p>Despite these challenges, protecting and revitalising Southeast Asia's coconut industry remains both possible and necessary. Governments must stop treating coconut smallholders as second-class citizens and roll out robust support on par with other major crops. That means subsidised replanting schemes as well as crucial bridge financing to tide smallholders over during the lean years of replanting. </p><p>Investment in research and extension services must increase dramatically. Technical assistance for integrated pest management, climate adaptation and intercropping systems could significantly improve productivity and resilience. </p><p>Beyond financial support, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3034641/why-coconut-boom-bad-malaysias-approved-permit-system\">market reforms</url> must address the price injustice inherent in current value chains. Smallholder co-operatives need support to bypass exploitative middlemen and directly access higher-value markets. </p><p>Additionally, governments should recognise coconut farming's environmental benefits. Traditional coconut groves sequester carbon, support biodiversity and prevent coastal erosion. Payment for ecosystem services could provide additional income streams while incentivising sustainable practices. </p><p>Coconut industry reform demands urgent action beyond goodwill. The Philippines' 75 billion peso (US$1.4 billion) Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund supports smallholders, while Indonesia is contemplating a coconut export tariff to help fund replanting. The opportunity for prosperity exists, but what is lacking is the political will to scale it up. </p><p>Beyond economics, the coconut's value is deeply <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/3017057/traditional-food-bali-spice-coconut-and-intuition-go-dishes\">rooted in cultural identity</url>. When a grove vanishes, what is lost goes far beyond trees. It takes with it centuries of cultural heritage, tightly woven community bonds and irreplaceable traditional knowledge. </p><p>In Bali, coconuts are sacred symbols central to Hindu rituals and offerings. They are ever present in local cuisines: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/2140670/why-are-so-many-steaming-mad-over-masterchef-judges-crispy\">rendang</url>, one of Indonesia's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3302825/indonesia-hungry-rendang-tempeh-get-unescos-intangible-culture-list\">most popular dishes</url>, requires coconut oil and milk. Without coconut, entire ways of life slip irretrievably away. </p><p>Today's price surge is not just a crisis, it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvest in a neglected industry. With appropriate interventions, today's high prices could finance the transition to a more sustainable, equitable coconut industry rather than simply triggering a boom-bust cycle. </p><p>Many coconut smallholders plant not just for themselves but for generations to come. Will their governments and companies finally recognise the value of what they do? The choice governments and companies make now will determine whether the next generation can continue these traditions or be forced to leave the land behind. Southeast Asia's answer to this question will shape the region for decades to come.  </p>", "publisher": "South China Morning Post.com", "instances": ["That means subsidised replanting schemes as well as crucial bridge financing to tide smallholders over during the lean years of replanting.

In Beijing last week, MFA spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China would work with other Brics members to build a \"more comprehensive\" partnership as well as promote multilateralism and support \"justice and fairness\" in the global order. <br/>\"The Brics cooperation mechanism came into being amid the collective rise of the Global South, which meets the expectation of the international community to safeguard world peace, promote common development and improve global governance,\" Guo said. <br/>At Monday's meeting, Vieira condemned violence in Gaza, calling for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, the release of hostages and unimpeded humanitarian access.

Wang Jian, co-founder and chairman of the Board of Directors of the BGI Group, emphasized that collaboration among biodiversity-rich Global South countries is crucial to developing high-yield rice varieties and enhancing food security across the continent. Speaking on the sidelines of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Science Week in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, Wang highlighted BGI's ongoing partnerships with African institutions in developing and deploying perennial rice. </p><p>Xu Xun, director of BGI-Research, said that perennial rice is particularly resilient in the face of climate change and urbanization. The crop, which can be harvested over multiple seasons without replanting, was named one of the top 10 scientific breakthroughs of 2022 by journal Science. As part of its broader efforts, BGI is working with the African Orphan Crops Consortium, supported by the African Union, to unlock the genetic secrets of 101 of these traditional African crops, according to Xu. Wang noted that Chinese institutions are ready to deepen cooperation with African partners in research, training, and technology transfer to develop new hybrid rice varieties and meet the nutritional requirements of Africa's growing population. He stressed that perennial rice holds immense potential for food-insecure African countries, given its early maturity and resistance to drought, pests, and diseases. Developed by introducing genes from wild rice species into conventional strains, perennial rice has already been introduced in Uganda, Rwanda, and Madagascar.

Thanks to this high-level engagement, the relations between Uzbekistan and China have evolved from a strategic partnership established in 2012 to a comprehensive partnership in 2016, to an all-weather strategic partnership in 2024.</p><p>The frequent high-level contacts have fostered a robust political dialogue. Regular bilateral meetings are held on the sidelines of international summits.</p><p>Trade and economic cooperation remain vital components. In 2024, bilateral trade exceeded$13 billion, with ambitions to raise it to around $20 billion in the coming years.

Notably, the declaration acknowledged the importance of the consultative meeting of the heads of state of Central Asia as a key pillar for regional security, stability and sustainable development.</p><p>A growing legal framework underpins this cooperation, with memorandums signed on trade and digital commerce. Future initiatives include platforms for emergency response, education, healthcare and energy.</p><p>Humanitarian cooperation is being facilitated through networks of administrative academies, regional forums, think tanks and news agencies.</p><p>A major milestone in institutionalization was the establishment of the Central Asia-China Secretariat in Xi'an in March 2024.

difficult operating environment, I am pleased to report that the Group's results for 2022 have demonstrated a commendable degree of resilience. A number of cities in China, including Shanghai, were affected by outbreaks of COVID-19, resulting in temporary lockdowns that depressed economic activity. This placed further downward pressure on the property market, with more developers experiencing cashflow problems. It is to the Group's credit that we have achieved profitability while maintaining a solid balance sheet, despite the headwinds.</p><p>Stable Performance Demonstrated Strong Fundamentals of the Group</p><p>Despite COVID lockdowns and the resulting Chinese economy and property market slowdown, the Group recorded a net profit of RMB1,475 million in 2022, with profit attributable to shareholders of RMB906 million. The lower profits are attributable to the support given to our commercial asset tenants during the extended lockdown in Shanghai, as well as the Renminbi depreciation during the year. Notwithstanding the challenges, the Group recorded a solid operational performance. Further, demand for the Group's properties for sale remained strong, with the year's contracted property sales amounting to RMB27.2 billion (2021: RMB30.3 billion). For the commercial portfolio, total rental and related income (including joint ventures and associates) was RMB2,802 million, representing a decline of 4% year-on-year.</p><p>The Group is committed to meeting its financial obligations. In June 2022, the Group used its internal resources to redeem the USD600,000,000 6.40% senior perpetual capital securities, resulting in a 13% increase in the net gearing ratio. During the year, the Group has repaid/refinanced a total of RMB 6,797 million of borrowings (excluding the perpetual capital securities).</p><p>November 03 2021: Shui On Land : Chairman's Statement</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>The coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic has swept the world since the end of 2019 and resulted in severe difficulties in the global economy. The PRC is one of the very few countries to bring the pandemic under control and achieve a relatively quick economic recovery. According to a publicly available market research, online sales in the PRC grew in the third quarter of 2020, offline retail sales in the PRC also rebounded following the pandemic. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (\"NBS\"), the gross domestic product (\"GDP\") of the PRC in 2020 was RMB101.6 trillion, representing an increase of 2.3% from the last year. For the national consumer price index (CPI), a 0.2% increase was recorded for 2020 as compared to 2019, representing an annual growth of 2.5%, while the total online retail sales in the PRC throughout 2020 recorded a 10.9% increase as compared to 2019.</p><p>The Group will continue to focus on the retail business and strengthen the online sales channels to maintain competitiveness in the PRC market.</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW OF THE GROUP</p><p>Our operating results for the year ended 31 December 2020 are presented in three reportable operating segments, namely (a) department store business, (b) property business and (c) others. During the year, the Group recorded revenue of RMB481.1 million (2019: RMB794.6 million). Loss attributable to owners of the Company amounted to RMB75.1 million (2019: Profit: RMB136.8 million). The decreases were mainly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, which has an adverse impact on both the Group's physical retail business and the consulting fee generated from the PRC property market.</p><p>Department stores business</p><p>Over the past two years, the business model of the Group's department store business has changed. Apart from the upgrading of its traditional department store to \"Shirble Plaza\", a one-stop shopping mall concept, the Group continues to improve and keep up with the demand for high-quality food and product consumption and services amongst the middle-class population in the PRC.</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 15, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 126 words </p><p>July 22: Shui On Land: Monthly Return of Equity Issuer on Movements in Securities</p><p>Monthly Return for Equity Issuer and Hong Kong Depositary Receipts listed under Chapter 19B of the Exchange Listing Rules on Movements in Securities</p><p>I.

The JV Company is owned as to 30% and 70% by Shanghai Ruixinli and Shanghai Xinfuli, respectively, immediately before and after the entering into the Shareholders Agreement.</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>Press Release article 5 of 15, 1812 words </p><p>April 29: Shui On Land : Chairman's Statement</p><p>Chairman</p><p>\"We will continue to focus on our Asset-Light strategy for business expansion, actively exploring innovations to our business model that will allow us to exploit our brand reputation and nnanagennent expertise further. \"</p><p>The year 2024 was very challenging forthe property market in China. After decades of rapid economic growth and urbanisation, China has entered a period of economic transition. The economy has slowed significantly, and consumer confidence has been weak due to the uncertainties faced by corporations and individuals alike. The property sector is undergoing structural correction, and many developers are experiencing severe liquidity constraints. Although the major cities have enacted measures to stimulate their property markets, they have yielded limited results so far.</p><p>Faced with such difficult and complex macro-economic conditions, the Group's long-adhered to, prudent strategy has demonstrated its resilience. In 2024, the Group recorded a profit of RMB810 million, with profit attributable to shareholders of RMBl 80 million. This marks a year-on-year profit decline due to fewer residential property completions and reduced recogised property sales. Total recognised property sales for the year (including joint ventures and associates) amounted to RMB7,962 million. For our commercial portfolio, total rental and related income (including joint ventures and associates) was RMB3,547 million, an increase of 9%. The Group's net gearing was 52% as at 31 December 2024, while cash and bank deposits totalled R1V1B7,734 million.</p><p>The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year of HKD0.036 per share (2023: HKD0.058 per share), which also represents the full-year dividend for 2024 amounted to HKD0.036 per share (2023: HKD0.09 per share). Shanghai's High-end Residential Market Continued to Outperform</p><p>China's residential marl et has been undergoing significant adjustment in recent years. First-tier cities have been more resilient, however, and high-quality and premium developments in these cities remain in strong demand. Shanghai, being China's leading financial and commercial centre, continued to outperform the rest of the country in 2024, as reflected by a surge in high-end residential transaction volumes in the metropolis during the year, which rose by 150% over 2023.</p><p>Our Group has long focused on the top-tier cities in China and on the mid-to-high-end segments. This has given us a very solid foundation upon which to face the challenges posed by the changing market dynamics.</p><p>Chief among our development projects in Shanghai is the Lakeville series, which since 2002 has been an icon for the city's upscale residential market, representing the epitome of luxury. Over the years we have strengthened our \"Best-in-Class\" leadership position in this market segment and the value of our Lakeville brand again proved itself in 2024. In late September, we launched the latest phase in the series, Lakeville VI. The launch was 3.6 times over-subscribed, and all 108 units were sold on the launch day. The total contracted sales amounted to RMBl 1,979 million, achieving an average selling price of RMB210,200 per sq.m. that was a record for Shanghai's residential market. This outstanding performance clearly demonstrates the high level of confidence consumers have in Shui On Land as a property developer, Riverville, our first project extending the Lakeville brand to a wider market, also achieved a satisfactory sales performance during the year, with 6,300 sq.m. of villas and townhouses sold.</p><p>This success bodes well for the next launch of Lakeville VI in late 2025 - 36 villas and townhouses capturing Shanghai's historical charm. All have exquisite designs and fine craftsmanship that evoke memories of the rich cultural heritage of old Shanghai. We expect them to raise the bar of luxury living, not only in Shanghai itself but for all of China. The exceptional reputation of the Lakeville brand will undoubtedly give us the opportunity to explore other similar projects and partnerships in the future.</p><p>Differentiation is the Key to Stable Occupancy and Rental Growth</p><p>The Group's commercial property portfolio has also performed well. In Shanghai, Hong Shou Fang has established an \"Ideal Neighbourhood\" with a refined atmosphere that further diversifies what we offer. Panlong Tiandi, meanwhile, has pioneered an \"Urban Retreat\" concept that creates a new lifestyle. A tribute to local culture and heritage, the Xinsheng Festival was a fresh cultural initiative that brought Panlong Tiandi's heritageto life this year. Celebrating traditional festivals with a modern twist, it offered a diverse range of cultural activities and a rich blend of experiences. The festival succeeded in attracting many of the younger generation and boosted both foot traffic and tenant sales.</p><p>Our office properties, meanwhile, provide a holistic offering for enterprises, attracting well-known names as major tenants. Despite very challenging office market conditions, we were able to conclude the new leasing of 230,000 sq.m. of space in 2024, primarily driven by our Shanghai portfolio.</p><p>The Group's Xintiandi communities that integrate live-worl -play-learn have enabled our commercial portfolio to maintain stable occupancy and increase rental income. Occupancy rates remained high across the Group's retail and mature office portfolio, averaging 94% and 91 % respectively. We continue to adhere to a customer-centric philosophy, strengthening our core competencies in community operations, supported by innovation in products and sen/ices, to increase recurrent income and profitability. We are evolving the renowned Xintiandi to a brand embodying a forward-thinking community lifestyle that celebrates local cultural and natural heritage. Two major new commercial projects, Xintiandi Galleria at CPIC Xintiandi Commercial Centre in Shanghai, and KIC Park in Wuhan, are scheduled to open in the latter part of2025. This will further enhance the vitality and attractiveness of the flagship communities in the two cities.</p><p>Embedding Sustainability Across Our Business</p><p>The Group remains steadfast in advancing its sustainability commitments and strategically balancing financial viability with environmental stewardship and social responsibility. Guided by our 5C Sustainability Strategy, we have moved decisively from pledges to tangible progress, embedding sustainability into every facet of our business.</p><p>Theyear 2024 witnessed a major step forward in our clean energy transition. In July, Shanghai Xintiandi became the first mixed-use commercial complex in Shanghai's city centre to operate entirely on renewable electricity, an achievement which helped elevate the share of renewable energy use across our operations from 20% in 2023 to 35% in 2024. Parallel to this progress, we achieved a 10% year-on-year reduction in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions intensity, and a cumulative reduction of 51.3% from our baseyearof 2019. These outcomes demonstrate the concrete progress we have made toward our 1.5C-aligned Science-based Targets.</p><p>Recognising that most of our emissions stem from beyond our own operations, we have built a network of suppliers of lower-emission construction materials, including concrete, cement and steel, and set clear emission standards for these materials in our procurement requirements. We have also helped our tenants optimise energy efficiency and increase occupant wellbeing through offering complimentary energy and Indoor Environmental Quality audits. Together, these initiatives have driven a 28.1% reduction in tenant emissions intensity since 2019.</p><p>To future-proof our portfolio, we completed a comprehensive physical climate riskon-site assessments across all our operating assets, identifying potential threats from extreme rainfall, heat and storms. Complementing this, we have also conducted a transition risk scenario analysis to quantify climate-related financial exposures and opportunities under different transition scenarios. These insights underpin our holistic climate adaptation strategy, which integrates resilience measures to safeguard asset values while positioning the Group to capitalise on green opportunities.</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>Our sustainability efforts won international acclaim throughout 2024. Most notably, we were honoured to be one of the 15 enterprises in mainland China to receive CDP's Climate Leadership Award for our exemplary climate governance and disclosure practices. Our debut on CDP's prestigious A List further solidifies our global leadership. Our systemic efforts to promote gender equality, meanwhile, earned us 1Runner Up in the UN Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) 2024 Asia Pacific Award in the Transparency and Reporting category, an important endorsement of our leadership in gender-inclusive disclosure.</p><p>Sustainability has therefore proven to be more than just a set of moral imperatives. It also sharpens our strategic advantage, driving innovation and growth across the Group's businesses.</p><p>Relentless Focus on Capital Managennent</p><p>The credit crisis in the property sector since 2021 has put immense pressure on Chinese developers. The Group has always adopted a prudent approach to manage capital, with maintaining liquidity the key goal. Despite the deep and prolonged downturn in China's property market and the offshore lending market becoming all but shut off, we have successfully fulfilled our financial obligations. Since 2021, a total of RMB45.2 billion gross of offshore debt has been repaid, including USD490 million senior notes due on 3 March 2025. Our proactive and innovative capital management strategy and high-quality assets have helped us diversify ourfunding and capitalise ourasset values. This has opened various avenues to improve liquidity, including the issuance of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, asset disposals, and other onshore financing channels. By reducing the proportion of our debt that is held offshore in this way we have been able to lower financing costs, given recent market trends.</p><p>Going forward, ensuring sufficient liquidity will remain our utmost priority. We will continue our prudent and proactive capital management approach, staying on top of the market and adopting the most appropriate measures for the Group.</p><p>Cautious Outlook</p><p>The strong fiscal stimulus launched by the central government in late 2024 and positive signals from the recent Two Sessions reflect the leadership's determination to stabilise the economy and property market. Although residential transactions in first-tier cities have increased since October 2004, showing signs of market recovery, the process of consolidation in China's property market will likely take several more years, especially as increasing geopolitical tensions bring further uncertainty to the market. Therefore we need to remain cautious and prudent.</p><p>The marked divergence in performance between top tier and lower tier cities, and between the mass market and premium segments, will continue. High-quality products will outperform even further, giving the Group more growth opportunities. Leveraging our established strengths in the mid-to-high segment of the property market, the Group will strengthen its product competitiveness and brand influence to seize new investment and development opportunities in this segment.</p><p>At the same time, we will continue to focus on our Asset-Light strategy for business expansion, actively exploring innovations to our business model that will allow us to exploit our brand reputation and management expertise further. In 2024, we entered into two new partnerships as part of this strategy. We are collaborating with Yong Ye Enterprise (Group), a state-owned company, on high-end residences under Lakeville brand in the Shanghai Xintiandi Community, as well as with the Shanghai Fengxian District Government on an urban village renovation project. In each case, the Group will provide professional management for the development, marketing, asset management, and operation of the projects.</p><p>Appreciation to our Stakeholders</p><p>Finally, I wish to thank my fellow directors for their sage advice during the year, and the management team and our employees for their hard work IVly sincere thanks also go to all our shareholders, business partners, and customers for their continued trust and support. Despite the uncertainties facing the market, together we will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 15, 32 words </p><p>April 24: Shui On Land announces AGM</p><p>Shui On Land has announced its Annual General Meeting will take place on Friday, May 16.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 15, Source: WEC, 44 words </p><p>March 31: Shui On Land announces dividend</p><p>Shui On Land today announced a final dividend of 3.60c per share.

This is meant to eliminate the impact of short-term natural variations, such as El Nino \u2014 a periodic warming of Pacific Ocean currents \u2014 on the climate system.</p><p>While global temperatures hit record highs for two consecutive years in 2023 and 2024, Chao said the spikes were due to the combined effects of long-term warming and El Nino, which lasted from May 2023 to May 2024 and amplified global warming to some extent.</p><p>Now, however, the planet is under the influence of La Nina, which began in December. Unlike El Nino, La Nina tends to mitigate global warming.</p><p>\"From this perspective, it is unlikely that global temperatures in 2025 will surpass those of 2024,\" she said.</p><p>But Chao noted that the current La Nina is weak and expected to be short-lived, meaning its cooling effect may be weaker than in previous events.

In its latest Zimbabwe economic update report launched Friday in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, the WB urged Zimbabwe to bolster resilience against climate-related shocks, focusing on agriculture as a critical pillar of the economy. </p><p>Statistics from the Zimbabwean government show agriculture contributes from 11 percent to 14 percent of GDP and provides employment for some 70 percent of the population and about 60 percent of all raw materials for the industry. The country's heavy reliance on rainfed systems and maize production, however, leaves it vulnerable to increasingly severe climate events, the WB noted. In the 2023/2024 farming season, Zimbabwe experienced a severe El Nino-induced drought, resulting in a 60 percent decline in maize yield compared to the five-year average. The significant reduction in rainfall, coupled with high temperatures, has led to widespread food insecurity and economic hardship. The WB observed that the government's ambitious target to boost agricultural output to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars by 2025 is under threat due to climate-induced challenges. \"Climate shocks disrupt GDP, trade balances, and fiscal stability.

Wildfires and earthquakes have crumbled priceless temples and monuments, and wars and armed conflicts have turned iconic landmarks into rubble.<br/><br/>Even in the absence of sudden catastrophe, heritage sites face rising threats. Rising seas engulf ancient port cities, while intensifying monsoons erode historic settlements. In China, sections of the Great Wall, built to withstand invaders, now battle desertification and extreme weather. From thawing Arctic permafrost destabilizing indigenous sites to scorching temperatures fading Australia's ancient rock art, no region remains untouched.<br/><br/>Human activities are accelerating the peril. While urbanization and unchecked development have led to encroachment of historic neighborhoods, sprawling infrastructure have fractured cultural landscapes. Even tourism, a vital source of preservation funding, is straining fragile monuments in many UNESCO World Heritage sites.<br/><br/>The loss of heritage is not merely structural; it is the erosion of humanity's legacy. As communities are being uplifted, valuable cultural practices and traditional knowledge disappear, fraying the fabric of human identity, collective memory, and the bonds that unite societies.</p><p>On this International Day for Monuments and Sites (April 18), we are reminded that cultural heritage faces unprecedented threats on a global scale. Amid climate disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and rapid urbanization, safeguarding our shared legacy has never been more urgent.</p><p>However, recent achievements by UNESCO and its member states offer a beacon of hope, demonstrating that collective action can preserve and even revitalize the irreplaceable treasure of our past.<br/><br/>The UNESCO Heritage Emergency Fund, a multi-donor initiative, enables rapid response to crises caused by armed conflicts and disasters. Through this fund, UNESCO and its partners have organized cultural workshops to support community recovery, developed a guide to prevent fires in cultural and natural heritage sites, and established inter-sectoral collaborative platforms to address Mongolia's extreme weather known as dzud. The recent completion of an eight-year initiative has revived Mosul, one of the world's oldest cities, after its destruction by Daesh (formerly known as the Islamic State).</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, UNESCO has advanced the MONDIACULT 2022 Declaration, helping countries integrate culture into sustainable development. Vietnam has expanded its legal frameworks for heritage preservation and creative industries with UNESCO's support, while Indonesia's 2024 National Cultural Strategy has reinforced culture as a pillar of development, and Nepal and Bangladesh have updated policies to prioritize cultural rights and climate resilience, and Tuvalu and the Cook Islands integrated traditional knowledge into climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>Among UNESCO's member states, China has emerged as a global leader in innovative heritage conservation, demonstrating how preservation can drive sustainable development. China's holistic approach \u2014 combining cutting-edge technology, community empowerment and policy foresight \u2014 offer replicable models for balancing progress with preservation.<br/><br/>China's use of cutting-edge tools has set a conservation benchmark. The Great Wall's AI-powered monitoring system, employing satellite imagery and 3D modeling, detects structural vulnerabilities with unprecedented precision. The Digital Dunhuang project in Gansu province has created a virtual twin of the Mogao Grottoes, reducing physical visitation pressure on the UNESCO World Heritage Site while making the treasure globally accessible \u2014 a solution echoing UNESCO's emphasis on ethical digital transformation.</p><p>After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the restoration of Dujiangyan's ancient irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, not only preserved a 2,300-year-old engineering marvel but also ensured it continued playing its due role in irrigating 11.3 million hectares of farmland. This aligns with UNESCO's call to integrate traditional knowledge into climate resilience.</p><p>China's visitor-management innovation, such as time-slot ticketing for the Palace Museum (Forbidden City), has inspired global peers such as Venice in Italy and Machu Picchu in Peru, while embedding heritage into rural vitalization programs has created millions of jobs, lifting communities out of poverty while safeguarding cultural heritage.</p><p>China has also become a key partner in global heritage conservation, sharing expertise through technical and financial assistance. Since 1989, China has been helping Cambodia to restore the Angkor Vat monuments, and since 2015, it has been assisting Nepal to rebuild monuments damaged in the devastating Kathmandu earthquake.</p><p>Through initiatives like the Silk Roads International Youth Forums, China has fostered intercultural dialogue among youths from more than 100 countries, promoting heritage stewardship. Since 2018, China has collaborated with Africa to strengthen capacity building and monitor systems for UNESCO World Heritage sites. China's multilateral cooperation aligns with UNESCO's vision of heritage as a catalyst for international understanding and peace building.</p><p>Today, we celebrate heritage as a bridge \u2014 not merely between past and future, but as a living connection between peoples and nations. In the face of division and destruction, preserving cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, movable and non-movable, becomes an act of hope and a powerful affirmation of the MONDIACULT vision that positions culture at the heart of sustainable development.</p><p>China has shown that through innovation, inclusive vision and global partnership, heritage can thrive as a testament to resilience \u2014 from AI-powered conservation to community-led rural revitalization.</p><p>UNESCO remains committed to strengthening its partnership with China as well as other countries, ensuring our cultural legacies not only endure but illuminate the path forward. Let today inspire our collective action to place culture where it belongs \u2014 as a fundamental pillar of human progress. Together, we can prove that the heritage preserved today becomes sustainable development tomorrow.</p><p>The author is director and representative, UNESCO Regional Office for East Asia.

According to news reporting out of Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"As climate change intensifies, understanding heat vulnerability - defined as the susceptibility of populations to the adverse effects of heat waves - becomes increasingly critical for effective adaptation and management strategies. This study uses an 'Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptation' framework combined with GeoDetector to assess heat vulnerability in Jinan and Guangzhou.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, \"The analysis incorporates Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), population density, Points of Interest (POI), and socioeconomic data. These factors are used to construct a comprehensive index system and a vulnerability measurement model focused on assessing the heat vulnerability of older populations. This study identifies vulnerable spatial regions and reveals the key factors driving heat vulnerability, offering valuable insights into its spatial dynamics and underlying causes in urban areas. The results show significant spatial disparities in heat vulnerability between and within the two cities. In Guangzhou, the core urban districts, such as Tianhe and Yuexiu, exhibit lower vulnerability due to robust infrastructure, higher disposable incomes, and extensive green space coverage. In contrast, peripheral districts, including Conghua and Zengcheng, face higher vulnerability due to uneven resource distribution and slower urbanisation. In Jinan, the urban core, including Shizhong and Licheng districts, demonstrates lower vulnerability supported by modern infrastructure and medical resources, while peripheral areas, such as Shanghe County and parts of Zhangqiu, show heightened vulnerability driven by ageing populations, limited healthcare, and lower economic development. At the community level, high-risk areas are clustered in economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods and regions with dense older populations. In Guangzhou, high-vulnerability communities (e.g., Beijing, Binjiang, and Datang) are in peripheral districts or underdeveloped areas with limited resources. Similarly, in Jinan, high-risk communities (e.g., Guanzhaying, Hongjialou, and Huanghe) are concentrated in peripheral counties and older urban neighbourhoods with ageing populations. To mitigate heat vulnerability, the study recommends enhancing urban green spaces, retrofitting ageing infrastructure, and implementing community-specific education campaigns.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These findings provide actionable insights into tailoring urban planning and climate adaptation strategies to improve heat resilience, particularly in rapidly urbanising cities with ageing populations and socio-economic inequalities.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing Heat Vulnerability Risk of Jinan and Guangzhou's Older Populations Based On Multisource Remote Sensing Data.

The UN agency said it remains dedicated to working alongside Somali communities, government partners, and global stakeholders to build sustainable and climate-smart food systems, rally support for climate adaptation initiatives, and unlock vital climate finance to strengthen resilience across Somalia. \"Through initiatives like anticipatory action, climate-smart agriculture, and community-led resource management, we are not only helping communities adapt but also fostering sustainable partnerships to secure financing for these efforts,\" Fausto added. At the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change underway in Baku, Azerbaijan, the WFP Somalia said it is highlighting the critical climate vulnerabilities affecting Somali communities, including frequent droughts, floods, and environmental degradation that severely threaten food security.

Our study showed that older forests had a substantial annual cooling benefit than adjacent medium-aged and young forests. Attribution analysis indicated that the cooling effect of latent heat flux counteracted the albedo-induced warming effect, leading to the net cooling effect of older evergreen needle-leaved forest or evergreen broadleaved forest.

But as developed nations commit at least $300 billion in annual funding to advance climate action, the need for a multipronged strategy to bolster effective climate responses for all remains.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>\"It has been a difficult journey, but we have delivered a deal,\" said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, following the conference's conclusion. \"This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the long-term nature of the deal, China, as the world's largest developing country, has advocated for stronger resource mobilization and improved climate governance, altogether holding considerable promise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pushing collective transition<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take the fight against climate change as an example. Beijing's focus on a just and equitable energy transition speaks to the interests of developing countries. These countries are the lifeblood of climate action, but often lack the financial resources to transition to clean energy. Bridging this financial gap is one area where the international community can play a vital role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, developed nations can glean valuable insights from China's rapid green energy expansion and consider strategies to support climate action in the developing world. For instance, China is expected to account for over half of the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030, and its continued leadership in international green energy initiatives and substantial financial contributions to developing nations are enhancing global climate action prospects. The country's multifaceted approach, leveraging different financing channels such as development finance agencies, multilateral development banks and private financing, presents a compelling case study.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the dire need for climate financing in the developing world, China's efforts offer an important proof of concept for developed nations to build on. As Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said at COP29, \"The international community should work together to accelerate energy transition in an equitable, orderly and just manner, keep the industrial and supply chains of new energy stable, facilitate the accessibility and innovation of green products and technologies, and foster new quality productive forces at a faster pace.\" (The concept of new quality productive forces refers to China's shift toward innovation-driven growth, technological advancement and high-quality development in various sectors of the economy\u2014Ed.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Recognizing the importance of climate adaptation, China is also willing to strengthen its engagement with the Global South. (Global South refers to the nations of the world that are considered to have a relatively low level of economic and industrial development, and are typically located to the south of more industrialized nations\u2014Ed.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is reflected in Beijing's push to implement a dedicated early warning South-South cooperation project and extend capacity-building training to nations. Adverse climate impacts and increasingly frequent extreme weather events have underscored the urgent need for climate adaptation in developing countries. A growing sense of marginalization led many Global South nations to advocate for a unified alliance at COP29. This was considered an important step to propel joint climate commitments while pressing developed countries to provide financial support and strengthen climate adaptation in the region.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Recognizing the specific concerns of climate-vulnerable nations, China has initiated a range of programs and development initiatives to promote sustainability. One notable example is the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC), which supports efforts in pollution control, environmental policy planning and other key areas of green development. (The Belt and Road Initiative was proposed by China in 2013 to boost connectivity along and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes\u2014Ed.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>COP29 has highlighted the critical need for robust representation of developing nations in global climate discussions. The BRIGC aligns with this imperative by fostering vital partnerships in green finance, investment, green technology innovation and South-South environmental cooperation, all of which are geared toward advancing the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Building capacity<br/><br/><br/><br/>To ensure effective climate governance, we must recognize and facilitate distinct responsibilities between developed and developing countries. Developed nations must lead by example, reducing their own emissions and increasing their climate ambitions. This will help alleviate the disproportionate burden on the Global South.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Developing countries, while facing resource and financial constraints, must also strive to enhance their climate ambition. Their resilience and adaptability are essential to a sustainable and effective global climate response.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As such, China's call for \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" with regard to climate change is significant. By delineating roles, potential conflict can be mitigated between industrialized nations and those that have historically suffered from high emissions and inadequate financial support. But what can effective long-term climate contributions look like when leading from the front? Take China's inputs at COP29 for example. The country announced that its 2035 nationally determined contributions will cover all major aspects of the economy. By prioritizing emissions reduction, China demonstrates a commitment to credible, sustainable and long-term climate action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To bolster the capacity of developing nations to address climate change, sustained support for resilient projects is vital. Such projects can provide both financial resources and technological expertise, enabling climate-vulnerable countries to implement effective adaptation strategies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>China's continued support for capacity building offers valuable lessons. The country has invested over 177 billion yuan ($24.25 billion) in project funds for developing nations since 2016 to help them address various climate challenges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To scale up global climate action, industrialized nations must increase their financial and technological support for developing countries. These measures are essential building blocks for effective climate action in the developing world. As the World Bank noted in December 2023, \"Without action, more than 130 million people living in the most vulnerable countries will be pushed into extreme poverty due to climate change by 2030.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technology sharing can be a game-changer in reducing emissions. By promoting the adoption of renewable energy technologies like wind, solar and hydropower, climate-vulnerable countries can be empowered to prepare for the future. To achieve this, leading renewable energy nations must not only expand their domestic capacity but also actively share clean energy opportunities with other countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/>China's rapid expansion of renewable energy is undeniable. The country is reportedly adding over 8 gigawatts of wind and solar power capacity every two weeks, solidifying its position as a global leader in renewable energy. Additionally, its investments in renewable energy projects across Africa highlight the value of international cooperation in addressing climate change.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given this context, China's climate contributions, particularly in areas such as emissions reduction and global climate governance, offer a promising approach for COP29, which aims to prioritize the interests of developing nations. By emphasizing joint action, China's proposals can help to foster effective climate cooperation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The author is a foreign affairs commentator, author and recipient of the Fulbright Award.

The Nile, Euphrates-Tigris and Indus river systems gave rise to some of the world's first civilisations. But their waters have also been linked to collapse.

Some studies suggest these glaciers could lose 80 per cent of their coverage by the century's end, a catastrophic blow for the countries dependent on this vast natural reservoir. </p><p>There is no danger of modern civilisations collapsing due to water scarcity, according to Michel. But water insecurity \"risks imposing a terrible toll on lives and livelihoods\", he said - pointing to a World Bank analysis that found water scarcity could shrink economies across much of Central Africa, the Sahel, East and Central Asia, and the Middle East by as much as 14 per cent by 2050, without substantial policy changes. </p><p>\"The likelihood of water becoming a driver of conflict is increasing,\" Laura Birkman, director of the climate, water and food security programme at the The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, told This Week in Asia. </p><p>Regions with rapid population growth, desertification and poor water governance face the greatest risk, she said. \"While the link is complex, a lack of water can harm health, jobs and food, especially in weak states, add to tensions and trigger violence.\" </p><p>In Pakistan, the threat is existential, analysts say. The developing country's outdated systems of food production leave it vulnerable to disruptions in water flow. Farmers, particularly in southern Sindh province, are still reeling from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3192743/why-pakistan-super-floods-are-warning-south-asia-and\">the 2022 \"superfloods</url>\" that submerged one-third of the nation, devastating crops and livestock. </p><p>An earlier catastrophic flood in 2010 slashed rice production in Sindh by almost 30 per cent, Michel said. \"Too much water can be as damaging to agriculture as too little,\" he said. </p><p>Extreme weather events had badly affected farming in Sindh, Muhammad Ali Bhutto, a large-scale agricultural land owner in the province, told This Week in Asia. </p><p>\"Most farmers here have lost money on every crop since the 2022 floods,\" said Bhutto, who is a special assistant to Murad Ali Shah, chief minister of the Sindh provincial government. </p><p>The plight of farmers in Pakistan's Indus River Basin has worsened under the weight of a persistent drought that began after last year's monsoon. The dry spell has ruined staple \"rabi\" crops like wheat and tomatoes, harvested in April, while delaying the planting of \"kharif\" crops such as rice and sugar cane, typically harvested in October. </p><p>In Sindh, Pakistan's second-largest agricultural producer, the outlook is especially grim. Even before India suspended water-sharing with its neighbour, crop yields were 20 to 40 per cent lower in the southern province than they were in upstream Punjab, Bhutto said. This disparity is caused by geography: the Punjab region, named for the five rivers flowing through it - the Indus and its tributaries - has better water levels and weather conditions. </p><p>Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan has the rights to the waters of the Indus and its westernmost tributaries, the Jhelum and Chenab, while India is entitled to flows from the eastern Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers. </p><p>For the subsistence farmers who depend on these rivers, any disruption to water flow can have \"devastating\" consequences, Birkman said, threatening crop yields, food insecurity and loss of income. </p><p>Many of these farmers, she said, \"often lack access\" to alternative water sources or financial means to invest in adaptive technologies, leaving them \"highly susceptible to the impacts of water scarcity\". </p><p>The resulting economic hardship can force families to abandon their land, uprooting communities and eroding traditional ways of life. For some, migration is the only option - whether to other rural areas or overcrowded urban centres, where competition for jobs is fierce. Others, particularly vulnerable groups like the young, may turn to illicit activities for survival. </p><p>The consequences are already unfolding along the Indus. In southern parts of Punjab and northern Sindh, the ranks of so-called Indus bandits - criminal groups operating near the river - have swollen in the wake of the 2022 superfloods. Nighttime travel near the river has become perilous, as climate-induced desperation fuels recruitment into these criminal networks. </p><p>Meanwhile, Pakistan's response to its growing vulnerabilities has been inadequate, observers say. While the government is pursuing large-scale \"corporate\" farming initiatives on military-run farms, developed with Chinese expertise under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/belt-and-road-initiative\">Belt and Road Initiative</url>, analysts warn this will not be enough. </p><p>\"Pakistan must recalibrate its entire food security doctrine away from the illusion of predictable flows,\" said Ehab Ansari, a Dubai-based business consultant with experience in Pakistan's agricultural sector, citing the prospect of Delhi building storage dams on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers. India currently draws about 20 per cent of the water from these two rivers for agriculture under the suspended treaty. </p><p>Pakistan has \"under a decade to meaningfully restructure its agri-climate ecosystem\", according to Ansari. This would require systemic reforms, including modernising canal irrigation, incentivising precision farming, building national cold chains and encouraging shifts in consumption patterns. </p><p>\"Beyond that, adaptation becomes crisis management, and survival becomes selective - not collective,\" he said. </p><p>Pakistan's agricultural economy \"is approaching a breaking point\", Ansari added. The country's ability to adapt to climate change and hydrological instability \"is not linear\" he said, predicting that Pakistan would face \"shocks, forced realignments and elite panic\" in the years to come. </p><p>Without significant policy shifts - both in climate adaptation for vulnerable regions like Pakistan and northwest India, and in global strategies to manage climate-induced migration - the ripple effects will be severe, Birkman warned. </p><p>These effects could include \"increased regional instability, humanitarian crises and heightened geopolitical tensions\", she said, adding that South Asia could see \"upwards of 40 million climate migrants\" by 2050, citing the World Bank's Groundswell reports from 2018 and 2021. </p><p>Most climate-related migration is currently internal, according to Birkman, but it is likely to \"develop a cross-border dimension as pressures within states rise\", requiring countries like India and Pakistan to develop joint frameworks for managing both internal and cross-border displacement. </p><p>The challenge is not limited to South Asia, either. Similar cooperation will be needed between Europe and Africa, and the US and Central America, to address migration driven by climate stress. </p><p>\"Ultimately, states will only succeed if they work together on these challenges,\" Birkman said. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Reuters</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "South China Morning Post.com", "instances": ["Pakistan's agricultural economy \"is approaching a breaking point\", Ansari added.

STATEMENT</p><p>In the context of an extremely difficult operating environment, I am pleased to report that the Group's results for 2022 have demonstrated a commendable degree of resilience. A number of cities in China, including Shanghai, were affected by outbreaks of COVID-19, resulting in temporary lockdowns that depressed economic activity. This placed further downward pressure on the property market, with more developers experiencing cashflow problems. It is to the Group's credit that we have achieved profitability while maintaining a solid balance sheet, despite the headwinds.</p><p>Stable Performance Demonstrated Strong Fundamentals of the Group</p><p>Despite COVID lockdowns and the resulting Chinese economy and property market slowdown, the Group recorded a net profit of RMB1,475 million in 2022, with profit attributable to shareholders of RMB906 million. The lower profits are attributable to the support given to our commercial asset tenants during the extended lockdown in Shanghai, as well as the Renminbi depreciation during the year. Notwithstanding the challenges, the Group recorded a solid operational performance. Further, demand for the Group's properties for sale remained strong, with the year's contracted property sales amounting to RMB27.2 billion (2021: RMB30.3 billion). For the commercial portfolio, total rental and related income (including joint ventures and associates) was RMB2,802 million, representing a decline of 4% year-on-year.</p><p>The Group is committed to meeting its financial obligations. In June 2022, the Group used its internal resources to redeem the USD600,000,000 6.40% senior perpetual capital securities, resulting in a 13% increase in the net gearing ratio. During the year, the Group has repaid/refinanced a total of RMB 6,797 million of borrowings (excluding the perpetual capital securities).</p><p>November 03 2021: Shui On Land : Chairman's Statement</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>The coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic has swept the world since the end of 2019 and resulted in severe difficulties in the global economy. The PRC is one of the very few countries to bring the pandemic under control and achieve a relatively quick economic recovery. According to a publicly available market research, online sales in the PRC grew in the third quarter of 2020, offline retail sales in the PRC also rebounded following the pandemic. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (\"NBS\"), the gross domestic product (\"GDP\") of the PRC in 2020 was RMB101.6 trillion, representing an increase of 2.3% from the last year. For the national consumer price index (CPI), a 0.2% increase was recorded for 2020 as compared to 2019, representing an annual growth of 2.5%, while the total online retail sales in the PRC throughout 2020 recorded a 10.9% increase as compared to 2019.</p><p>The Group will continue to focus on the retail business and strengthen the online sales channels to maintain competitiveness in the PRC market.</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW OF THE GROUP</p><p>Our operating results for the year ended 31 December 2020 are presented in three reportable operating segments, namely (a) department store business, (b) property business and (c) others. During the year, the Group recorded revenue of RMB481.1 million (2019: RMB794.6 million). Loss attributable to owners of the Company amounted to RMB75.1 million (2019: Profit: RMB136.8 million). The decreases were mainly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, which has an adverse impact on both the Group's physical retail business and the consulting fee generated from the PRC property market.</p><p>Department stores business</p><p>Over the past two years, the business model of the Group's department store business has changed. Apart from the upgrading of its traditional department store to \"Shirble Plaza\", a one-stop shopping mall concept, the Group continues to improve and keep up with the demand for high-quality food and product consumption and services amongst the middle-class population in the PRC.</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 14, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 174 words </p><p>June 27: SHUI ON LAND: MAJOR TRANSACTION IN RELATION TO CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION INCREASE TO THE FUND AND EQUITY TRANSFER OF PROJECT COMPANIES</p><p>TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT</p><p>On 25 June 2025, SODH (a subsidiary of the Company), the Existing Shareholders (each a subsidiary of the Company), the Fund, Fund GP1, Fund GP2, Fo Shan Shui On (a subsidiary of the Company) and Fo Shan An Ying (a subsidiary of the Company) have entered into the Cooperation Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the total capital contribution commitment of the Fund will be increased to RMB3,540,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$3,875,120,000) for the purpose of carrying out the Equity Transfer and holding the Project Assets through the Project Companies, and (ii) the 100% equity interests in each of Fo Shan Shui On and Fo Shan An Ying will be transferred from the Existing Shareholders to the Fund at the total consideration (subject to adjustments) of approximately RMB3,490,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$3,820,387,000).</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 14, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 104 words </p><p>June 19: SHUI ON LAND: DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTION FORMATION OF JOINT VENTURE</p><p>FORMATION OF JOINT VENTURE</p><p>The Board is pleased to announce that on 19 June 2025, Shanghai Ruixinli (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) entered into the Shareholders Agreement with Shanghai Xinfuli and the JV Company in respect of the joint venture arrangement of the JV Company, for participation in the Proposed Acquisition. The JV Company is owned as to 30% and 70% by Shanghai Ruixinli and Shanghai Xinfuli, respectively, immediately before and after the entering into the Shareholders Agreement.</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 14, 1812 words </p><p>April 29: Shui On Land : Chairman's Statement</p><p>Chairman</p><p>\"We will continue to focus on our Asset-Light strategy for business expansion, actively exploring innovations to our business model that will allow us to exploit our brand reputation and nnanagennent expertise further. \"</p><p>The year 2024 was very challenging forthe property market in China. After decades of rapid economic growth and urbanisation, China has entered a period of economic transition. The economy has slowed significantly, and consumer confidence has been weak due to the uncertainties faced by corporations and individuals alike. The property sector is undergoing structural correction, and many developers are experiencing severe liquidity constraints. Although the major cities have enacted measures to stimulate their property markets, they have yielded limited results so far.</p><p>Faced with such difficult and complex macro-economic conditions, the Group's long-adhered to, prudent strategy has demonstrated its resilience. In 2024, the Group recorded a profit of RMB810 million, with profit attributable to shareholders of RMBl 80 million. This marks a year-on-year profit decline due to fewer residential property completions and reduced recogised property sales. Total recognised property sales for the year (including joint ventures and associates) amounted to RMB7,962 million. For our commercial portfolio, total rental and related income (including joint ventures and associates) was RMB3,547 million, an increase of 9%. The Group's net gearing was 52% as at 31 December 2024, while cash and bank deposits totalled R1V1B7,734 million.</p><p>The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year of HKD0.036 per share (2023: HKD0.058 per share), which also represents the full-year dividend for 2024 amounted to HKD0.036 per share (2023: HKD0.09 per share). Shanghai's High-end Residential Market Continued to Outperform</p><p>China's residential marl et has been undergoing significant adjustment in recent years. First-tier cities have been more resilient, however, and high-quality and premium developments in these cities remain in strong demand. Shanghai, being China's leading financial and commercial centre, continued to outperform the rest of the country in 2024, as reflected by a surge in high-end residential transaction volumes in the metropolis during the year, which rose by 150% over 2023.</p><p>Our Group has long focused on the top-tier cities in China and on the mid-to-high-end segments. This has given us a very solid foundation upon which to face the challenges posed by the changing market dynamics.</p><p>Chief among our development projects in Shanghai is the Lakeville series, which since 2002 has been an icon for the city's upscale residential market, representing the epitome of luxury. Over the years we have strengthened our \"Best-in-Class\" leadership position in this market segment and the value of our Lakeville brand again proved itself in 2024. In late September, we launched the latest phase in the series, Lakeville VI. The launch was 3.6 times over-subscribed, and all 108 units were sold on the launch day. The total contracted sales amounted to RMBl 1,979 million, achieving an average selling price of RMB210,200 per sq.m. that was a record for Shanghai's residential market. This outstanding performance clearly demonstrates the high level of confidence consumers have in Shui On Land as a property developer, Riverville, our first project extending the Lakeville brand to a wider market, also achieved a satisfactory sales performance during the year, with 6,300 sq.m. of villas and townhouses sold.</p><p>This success bodes well for the next launch of Lakeville VI in late 2025 - 36 villas and townhouses capturing Shanghai's historical charm. All have exquisite designs and fine craftsmanship that evoke memories of the rich cultural heritage of old Shanghai. We expect them to raise the bar of luxury living, not only in Shanghai itself but for all of China. The exceptional reputation of the Lakeville brand will undoubtedly give us the opportunity to explore other similar projects and partnerships in the future.</p><p>Differentiation is the Key to Stable Occupancy and Rental Growth</p><p>The Group's commercial property portfolio has also performed well. In Shanghai, Hong Shou Fang has established an \"Ideal Neighbourhood\" with a refined atmosphere that further diversifies what we offer. Panlong Tiandi, meanwhile, has pioneered an \"Urban Retreat\" concept that creates a new lifestyle. A tribute to local culture and heritage, the Xinsheng Festival was a fresh cultural initiative that brought Panlong Tiandi's heritageto life this year. Celebrating traditional festivals with a modern twist, it offered a diverse range of cultural activities and a rich blend of experiences. The festival succeeded in attracting many of the younger generation and boosted both foot traffic and tenant sales.</p><p>Our office properties, meanwhile, provide a holistic offering for enterprises, attracting well-known names as major tenants. Despite very challenging office market conditions, we were able to conclude the new leasing of 230,000 sq.m. of space in 2024, primarily driven by our Shanghai portfolio.</p><p>The Group's Xintiandi communities that integrate live-worl -play-learn have enabled our commercial portfolio to maintain stable occupancy and increase rental income. Occupancy rates remained high across the Group's retail and mature office portfolio, averaging 94% and 91 % respectively. We continue to adhere to a customer-centric philosophy, strengthening our core competencies in community operations, supported by innovation in products and sen/ices, to increase recurrent income and profitability. We are evolving the renowned Xintiandi to a brand embodying a forward-thinking community lifestyle that celebrates local cultural and natural heritage. Two major new commercial projects, Xintiandi Galleria at CPIC Xintiandi Commercial Centre in Shanghai, and KIC Park in Wuhan, are scheduled to open in the latter part of2025. This will further enhance the vitality and attractiveness of the flagship communities in the two cities.</p><p>Embedding Sustainability Across Our Business</p><p>The Group remains steadfast in advancing its sustainability commitments and strategically balancing financial viability with environmental stewardship and social responsibility. Guided by our 5C Sustainability Strategy, we have moved decisively from pledges to tangible progress, embedding sustainability into every facet of our business.</p><p>Theyear 2024 witnessed a major step forward in our clean energy transition. In July, Shanghai Xintiandi became the first mixed-use commercial complex in Shanghai's city centre to operate entirely on renewable electricity, an achievement which helped elevate the share of renewable energy use across our operations from 20% in 2023 to 35% in 2024. Parallel to this progress, we achieved a 10% year-on-year reduction in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions intensity, and a cumulative reduction of 51.3% from our baseyearof 2019. These outcomes demonstrate the concrete progress we have made toward our 1.5C-aligned Science-based Targets.</p><p>Recognising that most of our emissions stem from beyond our own operations, we have built a network of suppliers of lower-emission construction materials, including concrete, cement and steel, and set clear emission standards for these materials in our procurement requirements. We have also helped our tenants optimise energy efficiency and increase occupant wellbeing through offering complimentary energy and Indoor Environmental Quality audits. Together, these initiatives have driven a 28.1% reduction in tenant emissions intensity since 2019.</p><p>To future-proof our portfolio, we completed a comprehensive physical climate riskon-site assessments across all our operating assets, identifying potential threats from extreme rainfall, heat and storms. Complementing this, we have also conducted a transition risk scenario analysis to quantify climate-related financial exposures and opportunities under different transition scenarios. These insights underpin our holistic climate adaptation strategy, which integrates resilience measures to safeguard asset values while positioning the Group to capitalise on green opportunities.</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>Our sustainability efforts won international acclaim throughout 2024. Most notably, we were honoured to be one of the 15 enterprises in mainland China to receive CDP's Climate Leadership Award for our exemplary climate governance and disclosure practices. Our debut on CDP's prestigious A List further solidifies our global leadership. Our systemic efforts to promote gender equality, meanwhile, earned us 1Runner Up in the UN Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) 2024 Asia Pacific Award in the Transparency and Reporting category, an important endorsement of our leadership in gender-inclusive disclosure.</p><p>Sustainability has therefore proven to be more than just a set of moral imperatives. It also sharpens our strategic advantage, driving innovation and growth across the Group's businesses.</p><p>Relentless Focus on Capital Managennent</p><p>The credit crisis in the property sector since 2021 has put immense pressure on Chinese developers. The Group has always adopted a prudent approach to manage capital, with maintaining liquidity the key goal. Despite the deep and prolonged downturn in China's property market and the offshore lending market becoming all but shut off, we have successfully fulfilled our financial obligations. Since 2021, a total of RMB45.2 billion gross of offshore debt has been repaid, including USD490 million senior notes due on 3 March 2025. Our proactive and innovative capital management strategy and high-quality assets have helped us diversify ourfunding and capitalise ourasset values. This has opened various avenues to improve liquidity, including the issuance of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, asset disposals, and other onshore financing channels. By reducing the proportion of our debt that is held offshore in this way we have been able to lower financing costs, given recent market trends.</p><p>Going forward, ensuring sufficient liquidity will remain our utmost priority. We will continue our prudent and proactive capital management approach, staying on top of the market and adopting the most appropriate measures for the Group.</p><p>Cautious Outlook</p><p>The strong fiscal stimulus launched by the central government in late 2024 and positive signals from the recent Two Sessions reflect the leadership's determination to stabilise the economy and property market. Although residential transactions in first-tier cities have increased since October 2004, showing signs of market recovery, the process of consolidation in China's property market will likely take several more years, especially as increasing geopolitical tensions bring further uncertainty to the market. Therefore we need to remain cautious and prudent.</p><p>The marked divergence in performance between top tier and lower tier cities, and between the mass market and premium segments, will continue. High-quality products will outperform even further, giving the Group more growth opportunities. Leveraging our established strengths in the mid-to-high segment of the property market, the Group will strengthen its product competitiveness and brand influence to seize new investment and development opportunities in this segment.</p><p>At the same time, we will continue to focus on our Asset-Light strategy for business expansion, actively exploring innovations to our business model that will allow us to exploit our brand reputation and management expertise further. In 2024, we entered into two new partnerships as part of this strategy. We are collaborating with Yong Ye Enterprise (Group), a state-owned company, on high-end residences under Lakeville brand in the Shanghai Xintiandi Community, as well as with the Shanghai Fengxian District Government on an urban village renovation project. In each case, the Group will provide professional management for the development, marketing, asset management, and operation of the projects.</p><p>Appreciation to our Stakeholders</p><p>Finally, I wish to thank my fellow directors for their sage advice during the year, and the management team and our employees for their hard work IVly sincere thanks also go to all our shareholders, business partners, and customers for their continued trust and support. Despite the uncertainties facing the market, together we will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 14, 32 words </p><p>April 24: Shui On Land announces AGM</p><p>Shui On Land has announced its Annual General Meeting will take place on Friday, May 16.</p><p>Press Release article 5 of 14, Source: WEC, 44 words </p><p>March 31: Shui On Land announces dividend</p><p>Shui On Land today announced a final dividend of 3.60c per share.

The region, once defined by competing territorial claims, has evolved into a hub of economic synergy, technological advancement, and environmental resilience. Once fraught with military posturing, the maritime domain now thrives under an integrated governance framework that fosters security, scientific collaboration, and sustainable development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASEAN and China, which witnessed maritime disputes in the past, now lead a global model of multilateralism, proving that diplomatic foresight, strategic patience, and innovative governance can transform a contested region into a shared prosperity zone. This envisioned future is not a mere projection but the result of a backcasting exercise, where I place myself in 2050 and look back at the critical transformations that made this reality possible.</p><p>The journey to this new reality was shaped by key milestones that redefined the trajectory of the South China Sea. This transformation did not occur in isolation, it was the result of decisive policy shifts, technological breakthroughs, and an unwavering commitment to regional integration.</p><p>As I reflect from 2050, I recall how, in 2028, the historic Code of Conduct (COC) became the catalyst for lasting peace. Unlike past agreements that were mired in ambiguity, this treaty leveraged digital governance tools to ensure transparency and compliance. The ASEAN-China Joint Maritime Council utilized blockchain-based agreements to manage resource-sharing and ecological protection. A Quantum-Enhanced Arbitration System ensured that dispute resolutions were instantaneous and immune to political manipulation.</p><p>AI-driven transparency measures incorporated real-time satellite imaging, maritime tracking, and autonomous monitoring drones. A Unified Regional Maritime Defense Network neutralized piracy, illegal fishing and other maritime threats through AI-coordinated patrol fleets. This strategic shift was instrumental in setting the stage for an era of trust and cooperative security.</p><p>By 2035, the South China Sea had transformed into the world's most advanced Blue Economy Zone, prioritizing ecological restoration and renewable maritime industries. Reflecting on this period, I see how hyper-efficient floating solar farms generated vast amounts of clean energy, reducing regional dependence on fossil fuels. Self-sustaining ocean cities were engineered with AI-driven climate adaptation technologies, allowing for human settlements that coexisted with marine ecosystems.</p><p>Marine biodiversity corridors were enforced through automated conservation fleets, ensuring responsible fisheries management and ecosystem regeneration. Hydrogen-based shipping fleets reduced carbon emissions and reinforced the region's status as a leader in sustainable maritime logistics. These changes were not inevitable but were consciously envisioned through careful planning and strategic investment in sustainable technology.</p><p>By 2045, the South China Sea had secured its position as the most interconnected maritime trade hub on the planet, surpassing the Strait of Malacca in economic throughput. Global powers, including the United States and the European Union, fully embraced ASEAN-China leadership in managing regional commerce and security. The region now exemplified a fully digitalized trade network, with AI-driven customs clearances, smart ports, and automated supply chains ensuring seamless global trade.</p><p>Maritime AI and robotics hubs facilitated self-repairing ships, AI-managed logistics, and deep-sea mining robots, driving the next frontier of industrial innovation. A new diplomatic paradigm emerged, where geopolitical conflicts were resolved through predictive AI models that forecast economic and environmental consequences of potential disputes, encouraging peaceful resolutions. A Unified ASEAN Central Bank for Maritime Trade utilized blockchain-backed digital currency to facilitate cross-border transactions, eliminating trade friction and reducing reliance on external financial systems.</p><p>Crucially, the rise of BRICS as a global economic powerhouse played a pivotal role in shaping this maritime transformation. By the mid-2030s, BRICS had significantly expanded its influence, incorporating new members and strengthening financial cooperation through the New Development Bank. The establishment of a BRICS Maritime Investment Fund catalyzed sustainable infrastructure projects across the South China Sea, providing funding for AI-driven port modernization, green shipping corridors, and undersea data cable networks.</p><p>The synergy between ASEAN, China, and BRICS facilitated new trade routes, reducing Western financial dependencies and fostering a multipolar economic order. By 2040, BRICS had integrated its digital currency into the regional trade ecosystem, further accelerating economic connectivity. The South China Sea evolved into a vital corridor linking the Indo-Pacific to Eurasia, serving as a bridge between the rising economic powers of the Global South.</p><p>This shift reinforced a new economic architecture where trade and investment decisions were no longer dictated solely by Western financial institutions but balanced among multiple centers of influence. The BRICS bloc's enhanced coordination on maritime governance and trade facilitation also led to the development of a Digital Maritime Silk Road, enabling faster, safer and more efficient commerce across the region.</p><p>Beyond economic integration, BRICS nations played an essential role in fostering multilateral security arrangements that enhanced regional stability. A BRICS-ASEAN Maritime Security Alliance emerged, incorporating joint naval exercises, real-time intelligence sharing, and a unified approach to counter piracy and maritime crime.</p><p>This structure, grounded in cooperative security rather than unilateral power projection, demonstrated that regional peace could be maintained through shared responsibilities rather than strategic competition. The diplomatic synergy between ASEAN and BRICS also helped resolve lingering territorial disputes by framing them within broader economic and environmental cooperation frameworks, where mutual benefit superseded historical grievances.</p><p>The journey from territorial tensions to regional integration offers profound insights for global governance. Diplomatic patience and strategic innovation allowed for a gradual approach to resolving disputes, supported by advanced technologies that made agreements credible and enforceable. Deeply intertwined economies make wars illogical and costly endeavors. Technology acted as the arbiter of trust, with AI-driven verification systems, quantum encryption, and blockchain-backed agreements ensuring long-term commitment to peace. The ASEAN-China blueprint for future maritime governance now serves as a replicable model for managing other maritime disputes, from the Arctic to the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>What was once a speculative vision in 2025 is now a lived reality in 2050. The South China Sea, once symbolic of geopolitical friction, now stands as a testament to the power of multilateralism, innovation, and strategic foresight. However, this future was not an inevitability, it was the result of deliberate actions, bold leadership, and a willingness to embrace the unknown.</p><p>As someone deeply invested in futures thinking, I can affirm that backcasting provided a vital tool in constructing this vision. By situating myself in 2050 and reflecting on the steps that led to this outcome, I have demonstrated how proactive governance, technological integration, and economic cooperation could collectively shape a peaceful and prosperous maritime future. The question remains: Will today's leaders recognize the seeds of this future and act accordingly, or will they allow history to dictate a different course?</p><p>The author, a PhD in political science, is with the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia.

For centuries, the continent was consigned to a position of dependency, serving as a source of raw materials for industrialized nations while importing finished goods at inflated prices. This economic structure reinforced cycles of poverty, underdevelopment and reliance on foreign aid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, in recent decades, Africa's relationship with the global system has begun to shift, and China has been a key catalyst in this transformation. Through a unique approach to partnership, China is enabling Africa to break free from traditional economic hierarchies, moving the continent closer to the core of the global economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China's economic rise and its focus on global engagement have created a blueprint for Africa's development aspirations. Over the last two decades, China has emerged as Africa's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $282 billion in 2023.Investments from China span critical sectors, including infrastructure, manufacturing and technology. These investments are not merely transactional; they represent a deliberate strategy to address structural impediments to Africa's development.</p><p>One of the most transformative aspects of China's involvement in Africa is its focus on infrastructure development. According to the African Development Bank, the continent's infrastructure financing gap is estimated at $68 billion to $108 billion annually. By stepping into this space, China is addressing one of the most significant barriers to Africa's economic progress. The construction of industrial parks, special economic zones and energy plants demonstrates China's commitment to fostering long-term industrialization.</p><p>Ethiopia's Hawassa Industrial Park, developed with Chinese support, has become a hub for textile and apparel manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs and boosting the country's export capacity. Similar projects across Africa signal a shift from dependency on raw material exports to the development of value-added industries.</p><p>Historically, Africa's reliance on Western aid and markets has stifled its ability to pursue self-determined growth. Structural adjustment programs imposed by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank often prioritized fiscal austerity over developmental needs, leaving African economies vulnerable to external shocks. In contrast, China's engagement is characterized by a policy of noninterference and mutual benefit. Loans and investments from China are often free of the political conditions that have traditionally accompanied Western assistance, allowing African governments to chart their own development agendas.</p><p>Trade between Africa and China has also evolved significantly. While Africa's exports to the West have historically been dominated by raw materials such as oil, minerals and agricultural products, China has expanded its imports to include a broader range of goods. This diversification incentivizes local value addition and industrialization, enabling African countries to climb the global value chain.</p><p>For example, China's increasing demand for processed agricultural products from Africa has spurred the development of agro-processing industries in countries such as Ghana and Kenya. By fostering these industries, China is helping Africa reduce its dependency on volatile commodity markets and to build more resilient economies.</p><p>China's role in Africa is not limited to trade and infrastructure. It has also become a key partner in technology transfer and capacity building. Through scholarships, training programs and technical assistance, China is equipping African professionals with the skills needed to manage and sustain development projects.</p><p>The establishment of technology hubs and digital infrastructure by Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, is bridging Africa's digital divide and positioning the continent as a player in the global technology ecosystem. According to the International Telecommunication Union, Africa's internet penetration is projected to reach 50 percent by 2030, up from 22 percent in 2020, with much of this growth attributed to Chinese investment in digital infrastructure.</p><p>Critics of China's involvement in Africa often raise concerns about debt sustainability and potential neocolonialism. However, the broader picture reveals a more nuanced reality. Chinese loans are typically used to finance revenue-generating projects, such as toll roads and power plants, that can repay themselves over time.</p><p>Moreover, China has demonstrated flexibility in renegotiating loan terms with African countries facing repayment challenges, contrasting with the often rigid approach of Western creditors. For instance, in 2020, China suspended debt repayments for several African countries under the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative, providing much-needed fiscal relief during the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The strategic alignment between Africa and China extends to geopolitical cooperation. China's support for Africa's representation in global institutions, such as the United Nations Security Council, reflects a commitment to amplifying Africa's voice on the international stage. Initiatives like the BRICS, and China's backing of the African Continental Free Trade Area underscore a shared vision for a multipolar world where Africa plays a central role. The AfCFTA, the largest free trade area in the world by number of countries, has the potential to boost intra-African trade by 52 percent by 2025, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. China's investment in the infrastructure needed to support this trade is a testament to its long-term commitment to Africa's integration into the global economy.</p><p>Future projections suggest that the China-Africa partnership will continue to deepen. The World Bank estimates that Africa's population will double to 2.5 billion by 2050, making it a critical market for global economic growth. China's engagement with Africa is likely to evolve to meet the continent's changing needs, with a growing focus on green energy, climate adaptation and sustainable development. Investments in renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, are already underway, reflecting a shift toward environmentally conscious development. These initiatives align with Africa's own aspirations to transition to a low-carbon economy and to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The transformative potential of the China-Africa partnership is perhaps best illustrated by its impact on perceptions about Africa's future. For decades, the continent was seen as a land of perpetual crisis, characterized by poverty, conflict and dependency. Today, Africa is increasingly viewed as a continent of opportunity, with China playing a pivotal role in reshaping this narrative.</p><p>As Africa continues to engage with China, the prospect of moving from the periphery to the core of the global economic system becomes increasingly tangible. This transformation is not merely a theoretical possibility but a present reality, evidenced by the infrastructure, industries, and institutions that are emerging across the continent. China's approach, which emphasizes mutual respect and shared prosperity, offers a compelling alternative to the exploitative relationships that have historically defined Africa's interactions with the world.</p><p>The story of China and Africa is ultimately one of hope and transformation. It is a testament to what can be achieved when nations prioritize collaboration over exploitation, and when development is driven by a shared vision of mutual benefit. Africa's ascent, anchored by its collaboration with China, is no longer a distant dream but a dynamic reality that promises to reshape the world for generations to come.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The author is the executive director of South-South Dialogues, a Nairobi-based communications development think tank.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily European Edition", "instances": ["The World Bank estimates that Africa's population will double to 2. 5 billion by 2050, making it a critical market for global economic growth.

In addition to undermining this goal, Trump's withdrawal indicates that the US is abandoning its commitments to a sustainable future.</p><p>Being the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the US accounts for almost 13 percent of worldwide emissions.

Already, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act have catalyzed substantial investment in renewable energy, and the private sector drive will probably carry on.</p><p>Regardless of federal policy, Tesla and other big US companies are advancing electric vehicle manufacture and alternative energy solutions. At the same time, a bipartisan coalition of 24 states \u2014 covering more than half of the US economy and population \u2014 has promised to meet net-zero goals by 2050. Yet, even with these efforts, the absence of federal leadership will slow progress and increase costs for US taxpayers.</p><p>The Los Angeles wildfires of 2024, which killed 27 people and destroyed over 12,000 structures, offer a grim reminder of what is at stake. Preliminary estimates suggest the disaster could cost the economy as much as $150 billion, and that figure does not account for the long-term health and warm-climate effects of degraded air quality. Studies indicate that every $1 invested in disaster preparedness and climate adaptation saves $12 in future recovery costs.</p><p>The US administration is basically compelling its citizens to shoulder an increasingly heavy financial cost by refusing to give first priority to climate change activity. Equally serious are the global consequences of the US withdrawal.</p><p>One of the first casualties is climate finance \u2014 that funding supporting resilience building, adaptation, and mitigation in underdeveloped countries. Although the US has traditionally been the biggest funder of climate change, Trump is projected to end all of these engagements. Particularly, low-income nations and small island states, already grappling with increasing sea levels and extreme weather events, will be most severely impacted by this.</p><p>With the US abdicating its role, the burden of leadership will inevitably shift to other major powers \u2014 China and the EU. Already limited by decreasing assistance budgets, European nations will find it difficult to cover for the deficit.</p><p>On the other hand, since 2016, Beijing has strategically increased its climate diplomacy, having offered over $24.5 billion in climate-related support to developing countries.</p><p>Recently, at COP29, Chinese Vice-President Ding Xuexiang reiterated that the country will enable renewable energy, adjustments, and technology transfers via its South-South Climate Cooperation Fund.</p><p>Yet Western countries have already begun imposing tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and restricting the use of Chinese-processed metals in manufacturing. With the US effectively sidelined at the upcoming COP30 negotiations, expect heightened noise in the Western media over China's role in global climate governance.</p><p>The worldwide climate crisis is currently happening, not a distant menace. Though the Paris Accord was never an ideal answer, it still stands as the most effective tool at hand for organizing global initiatives. Trump's second withdrawal undermines those attempts at a crucial moment. The costs of inaction can only grow. Ever more powerful storms, more harmful wildfires, and more frequent droughts will exact a continuously increasing price \u2014 not just on developing countries but also on the US itself.</p><p>The longer the US postpones effective action, the harder and more costly it will be to solve the environmental catastrophe in the years ahead. Though Trump might think he is rescuing the US economy by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, future generations will view this choice rightly as truly a hasty abandonment of duty with terrible effects for years to come.

That's why local governments have long teamed up with businesses in so-called public-private partnerships. Historically, these arrangements have helped cities fund big infrastructure projects such as bridges and hospitals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, our analysis and research show an emerging trend with local governments engaged in private-sector collaborations - what we have come to describe as \"community-centered, public-private partnerships,\" or CP3s. Unlike traditional public-private partnerships, CP3s aren't just about financial investments; they leverage relationships and trust. And they're about more than just building infrastructure; they're about building resilient and inclusive communities.</p><p>[We] analyzed community-centered, public-private partnerships across the world and put together eight case studies. Together, they offer valuable insights into how cities can harness the power of CP3s.</p><p>1. Clear mission and vision: It's essential to have a mission that resonates with everyone involved. Ruta N in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, for example, transformed the city into a hub of innovation, attracting 471 technology companies and creating 22,500 jobs.</p><p>This vision wasn't static. It evolved in response to changing local dynamics, including leadership priorities and broader global trends. However, the core mission of entrepreneurship, investment and innovation remained clear and was embraced by all key stakeholders, driving the partnership forward.</p><p>2. Diverse and engaged partners: Successful CP3s rely on the active involvement of a wide range of partners, each bringing their unique expertise and resources to the table. In the U.K., for example, the Hull net-zero climate initiative featured a partnership that included more than 150 companies, many small and medium-size. This diversity of partners was crucial to the initiative's success because they could leverage resources and share risks, enabling it to address complex challenges from multiple angles.</p><p>Similarly, Malaysia's Think City engaged community-based organizations and vulnerable populations in its Penang climate adaptation program. </p><p>3. Robust governance structure: Effective governance is key to ensuring that CP3s operate smoothly and achieve their objectives. For example, in Melbourne, Australia, the City Professorial Chair in Urban Resilience and Innovation includes representatives from the city and a university. It has a formal communication structure where research informs policy and vice versa. It aims to harness the research to better inform and guide policymaking and in turn advance research by putting it into city practice.</p><p>4. Commitment to innovation and growth: While we found that securing funding and in-kind support is important, demonstrating economic impact is crucial for the sustainability of CP3s.</p><p>Dublin's Smart Docklands initiative is a prime example of this. By leveraging technology to address community needs, the partnership attracted over 3 million euros (US$3.1 million) in investments and quadrupled the project's funding.</p><p>The initiative not only boosted Dublin's connectivity and tech infrastructure but also addressed public safety through solutions such as smart ring buoys. The buoys are life preservers with sensors to alert the city when its buoys are tampered with or stolen.</p><p>The case studies show that CP3s can be a globally applicable model for urban development, not merely a passing trend. By fostering collective action, sharing risks and leveraging multiple sources of funding, CP3s can be a powerful tool for cities navigating the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.

China could look to Australia, which has made major developments in this area, and which has recently signed a climate change cooperation memorandum of understanding with Beijing. </p><p>For example, the Flood and Storm Intelligence Sensing project in the Australian state of New South Wales is trying out the use of AI and mobile networks to predict flooding impacts by integrating localised real-time weather data and historical Bureau of Meteorology data to predict the expected impact of flooding on communities. These advancements could greatly support China's climate resilience efforts. </p><p>Challenges lie ahead. Beyond the costs of upgrading infrastructure and managing land use, other key issues like fragmented policies and poor coordination between municipalities and regional governments must be addressed. In the case of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3093062/yangtze-flood-passes-peak-eastern-china-no-time-relax\">Yangtze</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3259880/rescuers-chinas-guangdong-race-save-residents-flooding-after-heavy-rain-pummels-province\">Pearl River deltas</url>, according to a recent study in the journal Nature, a lack of delta-wide plans that \"systematically zone land and prioritise investments within one unified hydrological system\" has resulted in a fragmented approach to disaster management. </p><p>In the aftermath of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3229881/what-can-beijing-learn-worst-flooding-140-years\">severe summer flooding</url> in Beijing in 2023, for instance, experts pointed out that government bodies often look after their own jurisdiction. By aiming to move the problem and divert the floods quickly, even more pressure was placed on the downstream areas, worsening the situation. </p><p>To avoid similar incidents, cooperation across jurisdictions between central and local governments and across different departments is necessary. Doing so can enhance the effectiveness of climate adaptation measures while also acknowledging that climate impacts and infrastructure needs may vary across different areas. </p><p>Funding initiatives to address extreme weather events in China is another challenge due to potentially high costs. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3184471/what-are-chinas-sponge-cities-urban-flooding\">sponge city</url> concept, rolled out in 2015 to manage stormwater, exemplifies these challenges. Although the central government allocated 400-600 million yuan (US$56.4-86.6 million) per city for initial sponge city projects, total spending has reportedly exceeded US$12 billion. Beijing covers only 15-20 per cent of these costs. Local governments and the private sector are responsible for the rest. </p><p>However, local governments burdened by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3257981/chinas-local-government-debt-woes-hurting-private-firms-creating-grass-roots-distrust-academic\">substantial debt</url> may struggle to prioritise such expensive projects. Concerns are compounded by the ongoing efforts of local governments to address revenue shortfalls by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3276424/local-governments-china-smash-iron-pots-sell-steel-stave-debt-risk\">liquidating state-owned assets</url> in a process described as \"smashing iron pots and selling the steel\". </p><p>Amid a national economic slowdown, local governments facing soaring debt may understandably prioritise immediate needs over long-term climate resilience programmes. To this end, local governments may seek loans from the central government, private sector investment or even enter public-private partnerships. </p><p>The rising frequency, duration and intensity of extreme weather events in China has already led to substantial economic losses and widespread impact. While some significant steps have been made to address these concerns, major hurdles lie ahead. To better support the country's resilience to future extreme weather events, China must strengthen both cooperation across jurisdictions and invest more in advanced technologies. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2024.

In a joint briefing with African Union (AU) Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat on the outcome of the AU-UN annual conference Monday at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, Guterres said Africa faces challenges that are deeply rooted in history and aggravated by climate change, conflict and debt burden. </p><p>The secretary-general said the current global institutions were built at a time when most of Africa was under colonial rule and many of those institutions need to be reformed to help Africa meet UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \"The international financial architecture must be corrected to give more voice and power to developing countries in general, of course African countries in particular,\" said Guterres, noting that more financial support should be made to help developing countries mobilize resources and meet SDGs. He said the current international financial architecture often cannot give African countries the safety net they need, whether it is protection from strangling debt or from climate catastrophe they did not cause.

Released ahead of the upcoming 26th UN Conference of Parties on Climate Change, the second part of the UNCTAD's Trade and Development Report 2021 also called for a transformative approach to climate adaptation with advanced economies ensuring that multilateral institutions can support developing countries to manage the pressures from a changing climate without compromising their development goals. </p><p>An approach that is \"proactive and strategic rather than simply retroactive\" is needed, said Rebeca Grynspan, UNCTAD's secretary-general.
