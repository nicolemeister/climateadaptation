For 40 years, McDonald's and its supplier partners have jointly built China's \"McChain\" to take root in China and deepen local development. This year's Big Potato Day McDonald's China will continue to focus on the classic product Big Potato, show the process of potatoes \"from farm to table\", and convey the quality and interesting stories behind McDonald's French fries to more consumers.</p><p>Gu Lei, Chief Impact Officer of McDonald's China, said: \"Over the past 40 years, we have worked with our farmers and suppliers to pass on the belief of 'intensive cultivation and good potatoes, crispy outside and soft inside French fries' from generation to generation, and continue to bring McDonald's global classic flavors to consumers with fresh, safe and high-quality ingredients. Although a potato is small, it is the proof of McDonald's 'three-legged stool' business philosophy in China - the brand, employees and suppliers form a solid and reliable support, based on trust and common values, adhering to long-termism and win-win cooperation. After 40 years of persistence, from experimental planting to the improvement of both quality and yield, we want to grow good potatoes, and make the agricultural natural ecology more sustainable, so as to produce more delicious McDonald's food.\"</p><p>At this Chain Expo, McDonald's China and 11 supplier partners made their debut in the form of China's \"McChain\" and jointly released the \"McChain\" initiative, working with suppliers to jointly shape China's \"McChain\" new ecology, promote higher quality development collaboration, and jointly move towards a smarter and greener future. McDonald's China's booth area is 360 square meters, inviting 11 supplier partners including Beijing Baimai, Bimbo, Jiulian, Kerry, McCann, Sanyuan Foods, Shengnong, Shounong Group, Shunxinhui, Tyson Foods and Sun Valley, with the theme of \"Rooted in China, McChain Global\", jointly demonstrated the results of China's \"McChain\" upstream and downstream win-win cooperation, promoting local development, and actively exploring \"going overseas\" opportunities.</p><p>40 years of local development, a win-win industrial chain behind a potato</p><p>McDonald's China's potato planting history can be traced back to 1985. At that time, McDonald's and its French fry supplier Simplot started research and experiments. In 1993, French fries produced by Simplot's Beijing factory were officially supplied to McDonald's restaurants. After 40 years, the potato industry has achieved leapfrog development: Simplot China's annual potato harvest has increased from several thousand tons in the early days to more than 20,000 tons in 2002, and is expected to reach 92,000 tons in 2025; the harvest of McCann China and Lamb Weston China has also doubled.</p><p>Behind the increase in yield is the comprehensive upgrade of the planting model. In the early days, farmers used manpower and livestock to plant crops, and each household only planted about ten acres; now it has formed a large-scale modern farm, with mechanized sowing, fertilization, and harvesting processes, and GPS navigation makes sowing operations more accurate. As members of McDonald's China's regenerative agriculture program, the three French fry suppliers and farmer partners jointly promote regenerative agricultural technologies such as crop rotation, drip irrigation, and soil health testing. Currently, crop rotation has been implemented in more than 40,000 acres of farmland, and soil erosion has been avoided by planting cover crops in winter, and detection technology has been promoted to perform regular \"physical examinations\" on the soil. McDonald's China Supply Chain Academy has provided regenerative agriculture training to more than 5,000 potato farmers.</p><p>China's \"McChain\" focuses on \"taking root in China and connecting the world\" and continues to promote the optimization of the industrial chain. In 1992, Simplot built its first French fry processing plant in Beijing, and in 2016 it strategically moved to Ningxia to be closer to the production area; currently Simplot, McCann and Lamb Weston, three suppliers, have built four factories in China. McCann and Lamb Weston's new factories in China will be completed in 2023, with a total investment of more than US$450 million. With the upgrade of production capacity, French fries, hash browns, potato grids and twisted fries have all been localized. The crispy French fries developed for takeout scenarios have maintained golden quality under delivery conditions through process innovation.</p><p>The 11th Big Potato Day launches to unite the love of French fries</p><p>The story of potatoes is not only in the fields, but also in McDonald's restaurants. Since 2015, McDonald's China has used the homophony of \"Dashu\" and \"Dashu\" to hold the \"Dashu Day\" theme event every year, allowing more consumers to experience McDonald's good potatoes and good fries, and through a series of discounts, peripherals and interactions, it brings full emotional value. Over the past 10 years, \"Eating Dashu on Dashu Day\" has become a special summer agreement between McDonald's and consumers. At the booth of the Chain Expo, McDonald's also specially built a giant French fry as a pop-up store for Dashu Day at the Chain Expo for visitors to visit, experience and check in. In Beijing, 5 Dashu Day theme restaurants were also launched at the same time as the Chain Expo.</p><p>Today, the 11th Big Potato Day was officially launched at the Chain Expo, with the theme of \"Having potatoes is enough\", continuing the fun tradition of \"eating big potatoes during the Great Heat\". This year's Big Potato Day focuses on the love between consumers and French fries. McDonald's found that many people have had this experience when eating French fries: they always want to steal one of the fries in their friends' hands. So McDonald's turned this interesting moment into a creative peripheral-\"Big Potato Status Light\", which reproduces the road sign in the shape and integrates McDonald's classic big fries logo, providing \"Please do not steal potatoes\" and \"Take potatoes yourself\" double-sided prompts. After lighting up, you can show any side of the fries to enjoy or share, enhance the ritual of eating potatoes and the interactive fun of dining, and convey the happy atmosphere of sharing fries with friends. During the event from July 21 to 27, consumers can also enjoy a preferential price of 7 yuan to buy large fries or crispy fries.</p><p>Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated</p><p>[Category: Packaged Foods &amp; Meats, Hotels, Restaurants, and Leisure, Agricultural Products, Agriculture, Events]</p><p>Source: McDonald's</p>", "publisher": "China Business News", "instances": ["Behind the increase in yield is the comprehensive upgrade of the planting model.

This is our second time participating in the Chain Expo. We hope to have in-depth interactions with the supply chain 'circle of friends' through this excellent communication platform. In the future, we will continue to use innovation and cooperation as engines to further improve the quality, efficiency and sustainability of the supply chain and better serve restaurants and consumers.\"</p><p>China's \"McChain\": Rooted in China, McChain is global</p><p>McDonald's entered mainland China in 1990 and opened its first store in Shenzhen. In 2017, McDonald's China entered the \"Golden Arches Era\" controlled by Chinese capital. Empowered by local ownership, McDonald's China has taken root in the local market and achieved leapfrog development. The number of restaurants has jumped from more than 2,000 eight years ago to more than 7,100, and 1,000 new restaurants are expected to be opened this year. In 2024, McDonald's China will serve 1.3 billion customers. Behind this is the unique Chinese \"McChain\" jointly built by McDonald's China and its upstream and downstream suppliers.</p><p>China's \"McChain\" is not only a local chain deeply rooted in China, but also an open chain connecting the world. The development of China's \"McChain\" can be traced back to 1985. Before McDonald's opened its first restaurant in mainland China in 1990 , it began to explore local potato planting in China with suppliers. For 40 years, McDonald's has always adhered to strict selection standards and built a diversified supplier ecosystem consisting of McDonald's global system suppliers and local industry leaders. Through various reviews of McDonald's supply chain system, it provides McDonald's with key ingredients, packaging materials and logistics services. Among them, more than 10% of the cooperation lasted for more than 30 years , and more than 50% of the cooperation lasted for more than 10 years .</p><p>China's \"McChain\" insists on taking root in China, accelerating the localization of the supply chain, and vigorously supporting the growth of the potato, chicken, vegetable and other industrial chains. In 2024 , McDonald's China's supply chain procurement volume will be nearly 800,000 tons, covering more than 400 kinds of food ingredients and raw materials. Calculated by the purchase amount, the local procurement rate exceeds 90% . McDonald's China joins hands with \"McChain\" partners to promote strategic investment. From 2018 to date, more than 12 billion yuan has been jointly invested to create new production capacity. In 2024 , McDonald's China and suppliers jointly invested 1.5 billion in the McDonald's China Supply Chain Hubei Smart Industrial Park, which was officially put into use, and the McDonald's China Supply Chain Zhejiang Smart Industrial Park also started construction this year.</p><p>China's \"McChain\" insists on connecting the world, cooperating with supplier partners for win-win results, continuously sharing McDonald's global management experience and standards, helping supplier partners improve their capacity building, and creating development possibilities and opportunities for \"going global\" for supplier partners. For example, pies and McMuffins produced by Chinese suppliers have been exported to McDonald's restaurants in Asian markets such as Japan and Singapore. In the past two years, McDonald's Chinese suppliers have exported about 8,000 tons of French fries to McDonald's restaurants in Japan, South Korea and other markets each year.</p><p>\"Since 2008 , Jiulian Group has ranked first in China in terms of chicken exports to Japan for 17 consecutive years. In 2025 , we expect to export 60,000 tons of chicken to Japan and Europe , setting a new record, accounting for about one-fifth of the country's exports.\" Wang Xiuzun, chairman of Qingdao Jiulian Group, introduced, \"Europe has extremely strict requirements on animal welfare, and broiler chickens must be 100% cage-free. Jiulian Group has cooperated with McDonald's for 23 years. McDonald's high requirements for chicken quality and animal welfare have prompted us to insist on using a 100% cage-free farming model to supply chicken to the McDonald's system. This strict standard has tempered Jiulian's excellent management level. The cooperation with McDonald's also provides a strong endorsement for our overseas exports.

Not only is this an occasion to congratulate a local restaurant for attaining a global achievement but the fact that these goals are being sought is recognition by food service providers and by some clientele market segments of the harms that arise from conventional industrial food systems and the important role that Food and Beverage businesses can play.</p><p>Certification with The Food Made Good Standard allows restaurants to provide their customers a level surety that every aspect of their business is rooted in sustainable practices along three pillars: Sourcing, Social connections and Environment. Knowing the source - even better, being connected sufficiently to the source to even know the name of the farmer or the fisherman - and ensuring that land, sea, families and communities are not exploited but cared for and that their livelihoods are guaranteed for the long term is the first pillar. Treating people well is the second: staff are to feel safe, supported and valued, customers well fed according to international health guidelines and are also educated to make better consumption decisions, and the final social responsibility is to the community at large. The environmental pillar exhorts that food businesses tread lightly on the planet mainly by sourcing as locally as possible to reduce food miles and wastage: emissions are to be low, water use is scrutinized and pollution avoided; food is not wasted; and other waste is avoided or at least diverted from landfill: Waste, after all, is an operational design failure. </p><p>Meeting such exacting standards is not easy as we are embedded into an industrialised food procurement web that offers convenient access to goods delivered via providor consolidators at one end, and being locked into government-provided waste-management services at the other. This however has not deterred a number of restaurants - notably mainly well-resourced hotel-restaurants - in China, Hong Kong and Macau from achieving this certification by going the extra lengths required to find alternative procurement pathways directly from the producers and by shifting to a mindset of frugal hedonism in the use of resources. </p><p>Although Aji is the first in Macau, in Hong Kong are Austin Ferrando Balbi's Ando who is \"[i]ndebted to the generosity of Mother Earth\"; Swire Properties' The Upper House in Pacific Place, Admiralty; Hugo's at the Hyatt Regency, achieving a 2-star rating in 2024 (they have a herb garden on the ninth floor and partner with local food donation agencies); restaurants FEAST &amp; Sugar at East Hotels that have recycled over 6,400kg of oyster shells for reef restoration!; and the Grand Hyatt's Cantonese MICHELIN recommended, One Harbour Road where 1% of revenue goes to support farmers' regenerative agriculture practices to sequester carbon via the NGO, Zero Foodprint Asia. Although restaurants with The Food Made Good Certification can also be found in Beijing and Chengdu, mainland China is yet to be included as a key partner for The Sustainable Restaurant Association. The Standard was launched in Hong Kong in 2019 and in Traditional Chinese in 2024, with a view to extending the networks further throughout APAC. </p><p>These kinds of standards are important for food safety and environmental reasons. A study published in the Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems late last month by a research team from Xiamen warn of the accumulation of nutrients (namely phosphorus) used in agricultural production in the waterways and soils of the GBA.\u00a0 Inefficient applications in crop management, animal husbandry and aquaculture and very minimal recycling (7.89%) have led to most of the nutrient losses accumulating in soil (74%) and water (24%) creating environmental degradation. </p><p>Fake foods and ingredients have been a concern throughout China for many a year, but beyond intentional adulteration, factors affecting food safety in 11 cities across the GBA were found to be complex and varied in study data from 2022. In a paper from South China Agricultural University published earlier this year, of the factors causing food samples failing to meet the quality requirements, pesticide and veterinary drug residues ranked topmost, pointing again to harmful farming practices. </p><p>Growing awareness among consumers and suppliers about which agricultural practices cause environmental damage and food safety risks will hopefully prompt demand for efficiency in inputs and better management of natural systems via their food purchasing and consumption choices.</p><p>As individuals, to guarantee that our food is safe and soils and water (\"the commons\") are preserved, stewarded and restored, we would be growing our own - not possible for most people without access to some land. We can buy appropriately labelled produce (organic, from regenerative farms, no-cage, Fair Trade, \"responsibly sourced\") and trust the veracity of the labelling and integrity of the supply chains, but many claims are hard to verify and difficult to understand even for professionals. When we outsource our food safety and security as we lose direct links between the consumer and producer, and the parties along that chain hold differing agenda (not necessarily in the interests of the end used), certification bodies such as The Sustainable Restaurant Association offer a valuable guide to both providers and consumers.</p><p>Some restaurants such as Brae in Victoria, Australia, which like Aji have also been certified, take localisation and the ability of the consumer to verify the source of produce so seriously they are almost entirely integrated into their local supply stream: they practice regenerative farming themselves, eliminating chemical fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides and avoiding all logistics and transport emissions; they focus on soil health, building organic matter and engaging in land regeneration; they capture rain water for cooking, washing and drinking; they generate their own electricity, and compost and utilise their organic waste onsite, but only after any excess produce is preserved through pickling, drying, fermenting and other forms of preservation. Brae exemplifies the idea that \"sustainability in foodservice is deeply shaped by context - especially when it comes to access to infrastructure, support networks, legislation and local supply chains\". Restaurants close to the land, or even on the land, have a better chance to connect with it and become integrated into the local ecology. The production of food and the subsequent waste-streams are directly managed and even tangible to the consumers so that the potential harms are recognised and avoided there and then. Humans, like animals, naturally tend not to sully their own living environment, that we do so now screams of how disconnected we have become from our own life-cycle ecology.</p><p>In the metropolises of the GBA, similar literally ground-level integration cannot be readily achieved without either the vision of extraordinary leadership, or access to pathways and guidance offered by organisations that produce recognisable standards. The Sustainable Restaurant Association delivering the Food Made Good Standard is one such organisation creating awareness at the restaurant industry (through restaurants like MGM's Aji) and consumer levels that health of our soils and water are deeply connected to and determine the health of our communities. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By Leanda Lee, MDT</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/04-GBA.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Macau Daily Times", "instances": ["This however has not deterred a number of restaurants - notably mainly well-resourced hotel-restaurants - in China, Hong Kong and Macau from achieving this certification by going the extra lengths required to find alternative procurement pathways directly from the producers and by shifting to a mindset of frugal hedonism in the use of resources.

Petrus Muteyauli, deputy director for multilateral environmental agreements at the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, made the remarks at a stakeholder consultation workshop that kicked off in Windhoek, the country's capital, on Monday. The two-day event centers on strengthening the accreditation of Namibian institutions as Direct Access Entities for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). \"With an updated NDC, Namibia aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent from the business-as-usual scenario and further increase sink capacity by about 5,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. </p><p>To achieve this, we need enhanced access to finance, technology, and capacity-building,\" Muteyauli said.

To encourage the production of high-quality coffee beans, the center offered prices 20 to 30 percent higher than the market average.</p><p>Over the past 13 years, Starbucks has purchased more than 65,000 metric tons of quality coffee from the province. The percentage of coffee beans meeting quality standards has improved dramatically, rising from 20 percent in 2012 to 80 percent today, with about 3,411 farms in Yunnan now passing the C.A.F.E.

There is a need to address chaiienges such as weak demand, slowing investment, and subdued expectations. Enterprises were under significant operatlonai pressure and have become more sensitive to energy prices, driving increased demand for energy conservation and carbon reduction. The global situation remains volatile and complex, with the world economy expected to continue experiencing Instability and iow growth.</p><p>The Company has been developing integrated utilisation of organic waste (bio-energy/blogas) projects, which can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions, tackie local environmental pollution, and generate clean energy, through the process of converting organic waste, such as livestock manure, into biogas. During the process, the by-products can be used as organic fertiliser for the land to grow food crops and Improve soil quality, thereby encouraging regenerative agriculture. The projects are also In line with the development concepts of Innovation, coordination, green, openness, and sharing stipulated in China's 14th Five-Year Plan, and have responded to a series of central government policies, including the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Industrialised Development of Blo-natural Gas, implementation Opinions on Accelerating the Transformation and Development of Rural Energy to Facilitate the Revitalisation of Villages, and Opinions of the State Council on the Key Work of Comprehensively Promoting the Revitalisation of Villages by 2022.</p><p>REVIEW</p><p>During the year, the Group's total revenue decreased by HK$188.8 million or 38.5% from approximately HK$489.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2024 to approximately HK$301.0 million for the year ended 31 IVIarch 2025. A substantial amount of the Group's Internal funds was utilised as the Investment In the construction of the Integrated utilisation of organic waste project In this financial year, resulting in a reduction In the funds available for Investment In the petroleum business, which led to a significant decline In revenue from the business. The construction and engineering business faced significant chaiienges from the downturn In the construction industry cycle, and revenue also fell significantly in the recent years. The blo-energy business commenced operations from around the fourth quarter following completion of development and construction of wastage treatment facilities, which contributed little to revenue. The Group's loss to the shareholders Increased by HK$30.8 million or 153% from a loss of approximately HK$20.1 million for the year ended 31 l\\/larch 2024 to a loss of approximately HK$50.9 million for the year ended 31 March 2025, and the loss was mainly attributable to the significant decrease in revenue from the petroleum business and construction and engineering related business.</p><p>During this difficult time, the Board made prudent decisions with rational judgment and a long-term view of the Company's business and Investment of resources. In order to reduce Its over-reliance on the construction and engineering business and to enhance Its corporate resilience, the Group has Invested in the integrated development and utilisation of organic waste project with both economic and social benefits. We believe this will bring stable and sustainable returns to our shareholders In the long run.</p><p>PROSPECTS</p><p>Looking ahead, with the objective of protecting and creating value for the shareholders of the Company, the Board has been assessing the current situation and optimising the Group's resource allocation. The Group has been diversifying and developing new businesses, by expanding its business in a wider geographical area, and prudently entering more industry sectors to increase business diversification, so as to reduce the risk of business concentration in the past and lower investment in high-risk business. In view of the challenging market conditions and the gloomy property market, the Group will be prudent in further investment or resource allocation in respect of its construction and engineering business. The Group will concentrate its resources on its core prospective businesses in accordance with the Group's business plan and strategy.</p><p>In the long run, with its dimension, we believe that the dynamic Mainland China market will remain to be the driver of the development of the global economy. Based on the analysis of the Group's competitive advantages and resource strengths, the Board will develop more businesses following the national strategic development direction, pay close attention to the changes In the market, formulate business plans and strategies for long-term business development, and actively explore business opportunities In other sectors to expand revenue streams in an effort to offset the adverse Impact of the economic hard times. The Group endeavours to streamline Its businesses, which may involve a gradual transformation of the business model of the Group Into one which the Group will enjoy a competitive edge and has good prospects, with a view to improving Its performance and achieving sustainability.</p><p>APPRECIATION</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all our colleagues for their unremitting efforts and hard work in the current challenging business environment. I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to shareholders, customers and business partners for their continuing confidence in and support to the Group.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 19, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 124 words </p><p>July 24: LKS: Monthly Return of Equity Issuer on Movements in Securities</p><p>Monthly Return for Equity Issuer and Hong Kong Depositary Receipts listed under Chapter 19B of the Exchange Listing Rules on Movements in Securities</p><p>I.

The post-pandemic recovery of the domestic economy has also been slower than expected. The uncertainties brought about a challenging business environment, and the Group's business in Hong Kong and Mainland China was hampered to varying degrees, adversely affecting its results.</p><p>In view of the grim and complex business environment, the Group has adjusted its strategic objectives in flexibility to cater to the strategic direction of the Mainland China government in developing the country, thereby reducing business risks and enhancing corporate resilience. For example, an investment in the integrated development and utilisation of organic waste project was approved at the extraordinary general meeting held by the Group on 13 February 2023. The project can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions, tackle local environmental pollution, and generate clean energy, through the process of converting organic waste, such as livestock manure, into green natural gas. During the process, the by-products can be used as organic fertiliser for the land to grow food crops and improve soil quality, thereby encouraging regenerative agriculture. The project is also in line with the development concepts of innovation, coordination, green, openness, and sharing stipulated in China's 14th Five-Year Plan, and has responded to a series of central government policies, including the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Industrialised Development of Bio-natural Gas, Implementation Opinions on Accelerating the Transformation and Development of Rural Energy to Facilitate the Revitalisation of Villages, and Opinions of the State Council on the Key Work of Comprehensively Promoting the Revitalisation of Villages by 2022.</p><p>Press Release article 19 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 197 words </p><p>July 30 2024: LKS: VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT LOAN OF A SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY</p><p>This announcement is made by Standard Development Group Limited (the \"Company\", together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\") on a voluntary basis.</p><p>The Company is pleased to announce that on 26 July 2024, Standard Bio (Juye) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, as borrower, and Industrial Bank Co., Ltd., Heze Branch (\"Industrial Bank\",), as lender, entered into a loan agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") in respect of a loan in the principal amount of RMB50 million (the \"Loan\").

At the same time, cage-free breeding allows white-feathered chickens to have greater activity and produce higher-quality chicken. On June 26, we will also bring Chinese consumers the new blockbuster thin-skinned, charred V-wings made with 'cage-free chicken'.\"</p><p>Cage-free chickens: high-quality, green white-feathered chicken farming</p><p>Chicken is the most commonly used meat type at McDonald's China. McDonald's China works closely with its supplier partners to provide customers with high-quality, delicious chicken products. In accordance with McDonald's quality management, animal health and welfare, and regenerative agriculture guidelines and requirements, supplier partners raise white-feathered chickens in a high-quality, green way. One of the special requirements is that 100% of the white-feathered chickens used by McDonald's are raised in a \"cage-free\" way, that is, the white-feathered chickens are not restrained by cages in the breeding space and can move freely, eat, move and rest fully. By paying attention to animal welfare, the health level and chicken quality are improved. According to observations and statistics, the average number of steps taken by white-feathered chickens raised in a cage-free way is more than 1,000 per day[1]. The \"cage-free\" requirement has been implemented for more than 30 years since McDonald's entered mainland China in 1990.</p><p>In addition to the characteristics of \"cage-free farming\", McDonald's \"cage-free chicken\" also has strict requirements on the site selection, floor environment and grain feeding of chicken houses to promote high-quality white-feathered chicken farming. The chicken house needs to be located in a quiet area away from the downtown area, and the surrounding water and soil are not polluted; the breeding space needs to be flat and open to ensure ventilation, cleanliness and activity space for each white-feathered chicken. Professional breeders are closed together with the white-feathered chickens to manage them, pay attention to the growth and health of the white-feathered chickens, strictly abide by relevant national requirements, and do not use any growth hormones in the white-feathered chicken farming process; the feed eaten by white-feathered chickens is scientifically nutritionally matched to meet the growth needs of different stages.</p><p>At the same time, McDonald's is also working with suppliers to explore greener white-feathered chicken farming models. For example, it is piloting the use of renewable energy such as solar energy to provide electricity for lighting and equipment needed for farming, and exploring more effective ways to collect and process chicken manure to ensure that the chicken coops are clean, reduce the impact on the surrounding environment, and turn waste into treasure. Starting in 2021, McDonald's has been certified by the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS), ensuring the global sustainable cultivation of soybeans used in farming and the social responsibility of the soybean industry.</p><p>Cage-free chickens: Let more consumers know about the white-feathered chickens used by McDonald's</p><p>In order to allow more consumers to understand white-feather chickens correctly and scientifically and experience the quality of McDonald's chicken, McDonald's China launched the \"Cage-Free Chicken\" logo. Starting from the consumer demand side, it supports supplier partners' high-quality, green white-feather chicken breeding practices.</p><p>Starting from June 19, the \"Cage-Free Chicken\" logo will appear on the packaging of McDonald's chicken products, including spicy chicken thighs, spicy chicken wings, teriyaki chicken thighs, and crispy chicken. McDonald's China's online ordering channels will also launch the \"Cage-Free Chicken\" logo. McDonald's China has also designed a cute cartoon image for \"Cage-Free Chicken\" and used four \"Cage-Free Chicken Boxing\" techniques - \"Cage-Free Stretch Boxing\", \"Quiet Mind Cultivation Method\", \"Qi Refreshing Heart Communication Technique\" and \"Feng Can Spread Wings Technique\" to vividly describe the cage-free breeding, chicken house site selection, flat environment and grain feeding in the process of white-feathered chicken breeding. The limited-edition plate paper of this theme has been launched in more than 6,000 McDonald's restaurants across the country. Consumers can also download and use the same WeChat emoticon package of \"Cage-Free Chicken\".</p><p>Starting in 2023, McDonald's will launch the \"Maimai Farm\" food exploration and traceability project. \"Cage-free chicken\" will also be featured in the Maimai Farm live broadcast in June. Through McDonald's WeChat video account and Douyin Doujin store live broadcast room, McDonald's will take viewers to a base for raising \"cage-free chickens\" at the foot of the Wuyi Mountains in Nanping, Fujian, to observe and understand the supplier's white-feathered chicken breeding process, and talk face-to-face with breeders and base experts about the high quality and green stories behind \"cage-free chickens\". This time, McDonald's also specially invited the anchor of CCTV Agriculture to visit \"cage-free chickens\" together.</p><p>Mai Mai Farm: Working with suppliers to promote regenerative agriculture and present good food together</p><p>McDonald's continues to work closely with suppliers based on the \"three-legged stool\" concept, jointly implementing the requirements and concepts of food safety, quality management and sustainable development, and presenting fresh, safe and natural high-quality ingredients to consumers. In 2023, McDonald's China launched a regenerative agriculture plan, announcing that it will work with nine major suppliers to focus on five major areas: nature, soil, water, livestock and farmers, to achieve the systematic and large-scale promotion and implementation of regenerative agriculture concepts and practices, so that good ingredients and nature can continue to thrive.</p><p>Take chicken as an example. After McDonald's entered mainland China, it actively introduced and developed relevant suppliers to ensure high-quality, stable and sustainable supply in China. At the same time, it also introduced and implemented the world's advanced white-feathered chicken farming concepts and requirements, persisting for more than 30 years and continuously leading the development of the industry. Now, chicken suppliers such as Tyson, Sunnong, Sun Valley, Fengxiang, and Charoen Pokphand, as well as the broiler farmers behind them, all implement common standards to form a \"McMcFarm\" community, bringing \"cage-free good chickens\" to McDonald's consumers and promoting the high-quality and green development of white-feathered chicken farming and processing.</p><p>Fu Fenfang, Chairman of Sunner Group, said: \"We are very pleased to present 'cage-free chicken' with McDonald's China.

Agriculture must not only feed a growing global population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight climate change and safeguard natural resources.\" <br/><br/>Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China and the US<br/><br/>Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with the company. <br/><br/>The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when expanding their production, instead of clearing native vegetation. The REVERTE\u00ae program, originally designed by Syngenta and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential, includes Ita\u00fa BBA bank as the organization offering a line of credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria. <br/><br/>Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater Systems, TNC: \"REVERTE\u00ae aims to demonstrate, through an integrated solution involving good agricultural practices, financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic viability of restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits, increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits today and in the future.\" <br/><br/>As of March 2024, REVERTE\u00ae has garnered commitments from over 263 farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome. <br/><br/>China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17 thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m3 per hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group's fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta Group's recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to 1000 by 2028. <br/><br/>United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing cropland's climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative agriculture in seed production.

Extension of multi-year agreement that started in 2018, focusing on five strategic projects across the globe.   By 2026, ambitious target to recover over 300 thousand hectares of degraded land in Cerrado Brazil and regenerate agricultural soils in China with a focus to impact the agricultural sector for the adaption of sustainable farming practices. In the US the focus lies in enhancing climate resilience of crop land  Collaboration and innovation drive the transformation of agriculture into a climate solution that regenerates soil and nature.  23 May 2024, Basel, Switzerland / Arlington, Virginia, USASyngenta Group, the leading global agriculture technology company, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a world-wide conservation organization with the mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends, today renewed their successful collaboration that links conservation goals with economic potential and addresses societal issues like deforestation and land degradation. The two partners have been collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration in 2018. The new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects and focuses on further advancing business practices with the goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China, and the United States. The collaboration embodies Syngenta?s commitment to regenerate soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide  announced in April 2024.Petra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: ?We are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight climate change and safeguard natural resources.?Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China and the USSyngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with the company. The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when expanding their production, instead of clearing native vegetation. The REVERTE\u00ae program, originally designed by Syngenta and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential, includes Ita\u00fa BBA bank as the organization offering a line of credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria.Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater Systems, TNC: ?REVERTE\u00ae aims to demonstrate, through an integrated solution involving good agricultural practices, financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic viability of\u00a0restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits, increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits today and in the future.? As of March 2024, REVERTE\u00ae has garnered commitments from over 263 farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome.China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17 thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m3 per hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group?s fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta Group?s recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to 1000 by 2028.United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing cropland?s climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers.

In addition, it offers a step-change in performance against a wide spectrum of other important diseases, such as septoria in wheat and net blotch in barley. ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology is registered in more than 100 crops including corn, soybean, peanuts, vegetables, potatoes, grapes, tomatoes and fruit crops. <br/><br/>ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology embodies Syngenta's commitment to sustainable innovation, core to its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.syngentagroup.com/sustainability\">new Group-wide sustainability priorities</url> announced in April. The effectiveness and long-lasting activity of the technology enable low use rates and potentially fewer sprays especially in leaf spot diseases, while safeguarding beneficial organisms. It is also an important tool for resistance management. The technology works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is essential for fungal respiration, starving the fungi from the energy they need to survive. It is designed to adhere to the plant surface and to penetrate rapidly through the leaf surface \u2013 creating a reservoir of active ingredient in the waxy layer of the plant tissue that enables even distribution and long-lasting protection as the plant grows. <br/><br/>The technology further highlights Syngenta's success with the SDHI (Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) mode of action and the company's ability to effectively design active ingredients that address various farmer challenges. Following its first SDHI seed treatment sedaxane, Syngenta launched its SDHI fungicide isopyrazam which transformed farmers' ability to control sheath blight in rice, and later SOLATENOL\u00ae technology to protect crops against septoria and rusts. In Brazil, SOLATENOL\u00ae technology is today regarded as crucial in farmers' fight against soybean pod anomaly \u2013 a new fungal disease which spread within just three years to 12 states across the country since it was first identified. <br/><br/>Beyond innovation in research and development, Syngenta's success is <br/>underpinned by its commitment to invest in cutting-edge manufacturing operations. Strong global demand has fueled investments aimed at increasing the efficiency of manufacturing of ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology.

However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Among China's many provinces, Yunnan, which covers an area of approximately 394,100 square kilometers, stands out as a beacon of diversity. France spans 551,700 sq km, and in many ways, I consider France and Yunnan to bear similar significance to their respective regions; as both are champions of diversity.</p><p>Traveling through Yunnan, one experiences a dramatic shift in landscapes and climates. The south boasts elephants, tropical weather, and the Lancang River. Venture north, and you find yourself amid the Tibetan highlands. The province's terrain varies wildly in between, from lush valleys to towering mountains, placing Yunnan at the pinnacle of global biodiversity. This natural diversity is mirrored by the human mosaic that inhabits the region. Yunnan is home to 25 ethnic groups, most of which speak their own languages. The Yunnan language differs from standard Mandarin to a point that Beijing visitors barely understand what is said. This Yunnan language is reflected in a mosaic of local languages across the province. Minority ethnic groups make up 33.12 percent of Yunnan's population, and they all have their distinct languages. Yunnan is a vibrant tapestry of cultures, languages and traditions. The Yi people, constituting 11 percent of the population, are among the largest of these well-protected minority groups.</p><p>I am a BelgianFrench speaker, and we are very close to France and its unique culture. Yunnan and France share not only a similarity in terms of their diverse landscapes but also in population dynamics. With Yunnan hosting slightly more than 47 million inhabitants and France around 68.5 million, both regions have a relatively low density of approximately 120 residents per sq km. Both have a lot of empty spaces too. These parallels draw me closer to Yunnan. Yunnan also reminds me of Africa, where I was born.

From cultural tourism resources and ecological conservation efforts to its rich historical heritage and its myriad ethnic customs, Yunnan is a magnet for those seeking a deeper understanding of China's multifaceted identity. But the importance of Yunnan extends beyond tourism; it plays a crucial role in ecological conservation. This was evident when Kunming, Yunnan's capital, hosted the first part of the two-stage 15th installment of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in October 2021.The whole conference underscored China's leadership, and particularly Yunnan's exemplary role, in wildlife protection and biodiversity regeneration.</p><p>However, the task of balancing economic development with ecological preservation remains daunting.

for the entire Group, also including ADAMA and Syngenta Group China, that replace the previous sustainability targets. In 2013, Syngenta was one of the first companies in the industry to launch a comprehensive sustainability plan. The \"Good Growth Plan\" successfully served as the organization?s sustainability compass. The new priorities place sustainability at the core of the company's strategy and demonstrate continued commitment to sustainable innovation. This approach and clear targets help integrate sustainability on a strategic and operational level whilst creating long-term value: \u00a0  Priority 1: ?Higher yields, lower impact? through the acceleration of crop productivity in the agricultural sector, while reducing the impact on the planet through more sustainable technologies.      Priority 2: ?Regenerate soil and nature? by enabling the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices to help farmers improve productivity, soil health, biodiversity and climate.      Priority 3: ?Improve rural prosperity? by focusing on the prosperity of low-income and under-served farmers and their access to inputs, knowledge, finance and markets.      Priority 4: ?Sustainable operations? by the means of reducing the environmental impact of Syngenta Group?s own operations and the supply chain; strengthening a diverse and inclusive culture and ensuring the health and safety of its employees.   The new priorities leverage the power of innovation, guide investments and collaboration as well as add a new level of transparency through a Portfolio Sustainability Framework (PSF). To find out more about Syngenta Group?s new sustainability priorities, the specific targets and the PSF, please visit the website Sustainability Priorities.Today Syngenta Group also published the Syngenta Group and Syngenta AG ESG reports for the year ended 31 December 2023.\u00a0EndnotesFor further information, see the reporting of financial results for ADAMA Ltd. (SHE: 000553), Sinofert Holdings (SEHK: 0297), Winall Hi-tech Seed (SHE: 300087), Yangnong Chemical (SHA: 600486) and Syngenta AG.Unless otherwise mentioned, comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Certain amounts, including components of change (%), may not add up due to rounding. The results presented in this release are unaudited and a consolidation of the business units in the Syngenta Group which includes Syngenta AG, Syngenta Group China, ADAMA Ltd., Sinofert Holdings, Winall Hi-tech Seed and Yangnong Chemical. As a change to previous reporting, Yangnong Chemical sales have been fully included within the Syngenta Group China results, including exports, rather than partially appended in the Group?s Crop Protection units as previously presented. In addition, the regional split of Syngenta Crop Protection, Syngenta Seeds, and the sub business unit split of Syngenta Group China have been amended to reflect a revised management structure and operating model within these units. Comparative figures for 2023 have been amended to reflect these changes on a consistent basis; total sales are unchanged.Results in this report from one period to another period are, where appropriate, compared using constant exchange rates (CER). To present that information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into US dollars at the prior period's exchange rates, rather than at the exchange rates for the current year. The CER presentation indicates the business performance before taking into account currency exchange fluctuations.EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and EBITDA as defined by Syngenta Group may not be comparable to similarly described measures at other companies. Syngenta Group has defined EBITDA as earnings before interest, tax, non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and impairment. Information concerning EBITDA has been included as it is used by management and by investors as a supplementary measure of operating performance.

The fenced vegetable field was surrounded by a row of farmers' houses, an open-air fitness gym and a variety of trees, including a bamboo grove.<br/><br/>I walked close to the young woman, now holding a bunch of garlic scapes in her right hand, and struck a conversation with her: \"Lovely garlic scapes! Much better than the ones I grew on my balcony a few months ago.\"<br/><br/>I told her I had experimented with growing garlic scapes and bean sprouts for fun.

He likes our stuff!\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Our stuff?\" I thought to myself. \"They must be a couple, and the little girl is their daughter.\"<br/><br/>It turned out I guessed right.

Shall I pay you?\" I asked shyly.<br/><br/>\"Just take it, it's fun, and it's free!\" he said, with a smile.<br/><br/>He said he was born and bred in the village, and now works and lives in a downtown area of Songjiang District.<br/><br/>\"This vegetable field is my aunt's, which is bigger and better than mine,\" he said. \"These local vegetables are fresh and clean. We rarely use chemical fertilizer.

She was overjoyed. My wife and I are both big fans of fresh local food.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Small and neat vegetable fields are everywhere to be seen in Zhuqiao Village, and most are by or among various trees, creating a unique scene of rural biodiversity. <br/><br/>This biodiverse environment once again reminded me of the late American biologist and writer Rachel Carson (1907-1964), who proved a mixed growth of plants would help reduce insect harm and reliance on chemical pesticides.<br/><br/>After bidding farewell to the generous couple, I went to the adjacent Xingwang Village, which was also listed as one of the city's latest batch of beautiful villages.

As nearly 2,500 global leaders from business, politics, civil society and the media are meeting in the Swiss mountain town this week, WWF called on them to accelerate their action to tackle climate and nature crises.

From international giants like Nestle and LEGO to a Tanzanian seaweed farmer's single shop, participants worldwide are gearing up to welcome hundreds of thousands of visitors. \"The expo will definitely open doors for seaweed products to the huge Chinese market,\" said 58-year-old Saphia Hashim Makame, a seaweed farmer since 1998. \"With the exhibition of seaweed products at the expo, my journey to finding global markets has just begun,\" she said when she learned her seaweed products will, for the first time, be exhibited at the expo. Scheduled for Nov. </p><p>5-10 in Shanghai, the expo showcases China's new development paradigm, a platform for high-standard opening up, and a public good for the whole world. MARKET OPPORTUNITIES The CIIE this year is expected to attract guests from 154 countries, regions and international organizations. Over 3,400 exhibitors and 394,000 professional visitors have registered to attend the event, representing a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels. Among the 3,000 global companies participating this year, roughly 200 companies have been to every expo since 2018, and around 400 companies are returning to the expo after a gap of more than two years. China is offering opportunities to foreign enterprises by allowing them to access its large market through exhibitions like the CIIE, said Frandan Tumukunde, a coffee practitioner from Uganda. According to his company's research, the Chinese market has been expanding, and that will stimulate the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises in Uganda and across Africa. As China is one of New Zealand's dairy giant Fonterra's most important strategic markets, the company has increased both its booth area and the number of contracts it has signed at CIIE over the years, said Teh-han Chow, Fonterra's Greater China CEO. \"I think the Chinese market will grow very fast compared to other countries, and there is a big potential for exporters to find the customers,\" said Marek Vyskocil, founder of BlueTouch Export, a Czech drinks exporter attending the expo for the sixth time. \"I expect we will again meet more people, and maybe more people like to buy our wine from the warehouse we have in China.\" Nestle will also participate in the CIIE for the sixth consecutive time, looking forward to continuing industry exchanges and communicating with consumers online and offline through various forms, said Zhang Xiqiang, executive vice president of the Swiss food giant. This year, Nestle will bring imported products from 10 core business units to the expo, including dairy products, infant nutrition, espresso coffee and pet food, Zhang said. Expecting to unlock the potential of China's growing toy market, global toy giant LEGO plans to highlight the role of playing in shaping a child's confidence, cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing as it attends the event for the sixth time. \"We have been active in seizing the market opportunities provided by the CIIE by offering the latest quality products and play experience to Chinese consumers,\" said Paul Huang, senior vice president of the LEGO Group and general manager of LEGO China. \"It's a manifestation of our long-term commitment to the Chinese market, which we will continue exploring,\" Huang added. The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) will lead a delegation of over 500 senior business representatives from 56 Singaporean companies in search of fresh market opportunities. \"The CIIE remains an essential platform for Singapore businesses to grow in the Chinese market, particularly in high-growth areas such as digital innovation and sustainability,\" said Kok Ping Soon, CEO of the SBF. TRADE PROSPERITY Official data showed that China's imports have maintained sound momentum, with import volume expanding quarter by quarter this year. China has been the world's second-largest import market for 14 consecutive years. \"The expo shows that China is open for business with the rest of the world. It's a great opportunity for multinationals such as Henkel to showcase our technologies,\" said Rajat Agarwal, president of Henkel Greater China, adding that China is a huge market with strong growth potential for trade, filled with various exciting opportunities. Roula Ali Adeeb, founder of BioCham company for natural oil extracts, has participated at the CIIE since its inception in 2018. The Syrian businesswoman said the expo has offered a significant opportunity to catapult her brand into the bustling Chinese market. She said that with support from the Chinese government, the company has set a foothold in the vast Chinese market thanks to the reduced costs. The CIIE is a great platform to connect exporters with potential buyers and investors, said Thiru Naidoo, senior trade manager for the Middle East and Asia of the Western Cape Tourism, Trade, and Investment Promotion Agency (Wesgro) in South Africa, highlighting the substantial benefits it offers to her country's exporters. Elly Twineyo, executive director of Uganda Export Promotion Board, said China provides opportunities for all nations beyond their bilateral relations with the Asian country. Besides offering opportunities for emerging and developing economies, the CIIE is also a networking platform where Chinese enterprises can partner with foreign companies to provide products or services for the Chinese or global markets, Twineyo said. COMMON DEVELOPMENT Sixty-nine countries and three international organizations have confirmed their participation in the Country Exhibitions, among which 11 countries for the first time. The previous five expos have seen about 350 billion U.S. dollars worth of tentative deals. Phumtham Wechayachai, deputy prime minister of Thailand, said that the CIIE reflects the strengthened cooperation among China, Thailand and other participating countries. \"The CIIE serves the goal of importing various products and expanding relationships,\" he said. CIIE also allows smaller and less influential countries to grow together, said Phumtham, noting that China treats other countries equally and \"emphasizes the importance of fostering cooperation.\" The expo is \"an important measure for China to open its market to the world and promote economic and trade exchanges and cooperation with other countries,\" said Nestle's Zhang. As an efficient and innovative platform, \"the CIIE marks China's continued opening up of its domestic market and its efforts to further integrate with the world. It also demonstrates China's determination to promote new consumption trends,\" Zhang told Xinhua. Being an \"important measure for China to support trade liberalization and economic globalization,\" the CIIE practices genuine multilateralism and builds more open consensus, thus being particularly valuable for the economic development of today's world, he said. \"The CIIE also witnessed important moments when we signed contracts and cooperated with many industry partners. At the fifth CIIE, Nestle and (German pharmaceutical giant) Bayer signed a cooperation deal on a rice regenerative agriculture project, the first global cooperation project landed in China between the two parties,\" Zhang said. Abu Bakr al-Deeb, an advisor to the Cairo-based Arab Center for Research and Studies, called the CIIE \"a bright spot for activating world trade and economic globalization\" and seeks to break \"unipolarity.\" Al-Deeb believes that the CIIE opens wider doors for international companies, emerging businesses and medium-sized firms to find a place in the massive consuming market in China, the world's second-largest economy and second-largest importer. He pointed out that China's opening-up policy benefits the global economy, emphasizing China's significance as a global player, adding that China's opening-up and developmental track record has won the confidence of many countries.

Conrad Koh Samui's is said to be one of the largest hotel-managed organic farms in Southeast Asia. </p><p>It began in 2019, when the resort's general manager Ruben Dario Gabino noticed there was a plot of unused forested land on the estate. Not knowing a thing about gardening, Gabino read <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Regenerative Agriculture</emphasis> (2019), by Richard Perkins, to learn about various farming techniques, and decided to put theory into practice. </p><p>Gabino wanted to create a circular economy: using food waste to restore soil and reduce the need for trash collection; and grow produce to use in the restaurants, saving money and ensuring quality. </p><p>When the pandemic struck a year later, with global travel restrictions in place, disruptions in logistics chains and fewer guests travelling to the resort, Gabino and his team found themselves with the opportunity to further experiment and develop the concept of operating a more self-sustaining model. </p><p>Today, Iris Farm is thriving, with produce including pandan, corn, aubergines, chilli, ginger and leafy greens, as well as lemon, cacao and coffee plants. Some 2,500kg of food waste is composted monthly and used throughout the property as fertiliser. </p><p>Justin Galea, Conrad Koh Samui's director of culinary operations, says the hotel's various outlets consider which ingredients are available when planning their menus. </p><p>For example, the banana and papaya trees have been bearing so much fruit, the team has had to find creative ways to use the harvest sustainably. It is one of the reasons an abundance of crispy (and healthy) banana chips is made available to guests in-room and as snacks on island-hopping boat rides. </p><p>Even smaller crop yields are carefully parcelled out - pepper from the farm is used specifically at upscale steakhouse Jahn. </p><p>\"The products from Iris Farm are harvested only when they are fully mature. There is a vast difference between a month-old product bought from the super\u00admarket or supplier, and one harvested at the right time and used the same day,\" says Gabino. </p><p>Despite the farm's lush appearance, it has been a laborious process of trial and error, says Gabino. Despite their best efforts, some plants such as strawberries and grapes have not taken to the soil. They are currently working on avocado trees but it is likely to be about three years before they will bear fruit. </p><p>On the resort grounds, there is also Botanikka Eco Cafe, which was converted from an unused villa. It houses a hydroponics system to grow vegetables including lettuce, coriander and spring onion in water-based mineral solutions, and a mushroom farm that produces impressive amounts of fungi for use in Asian and Western dishes. </p><p>Botanikka serves house-roasted coffee made with beans sourced from northern Thailand and, in line with the resort's ethos of conscious consumption, is a venue for coffee roasting and kombucha making workshops. One drink well worth trying is the coffee kombucha, which is upcycled from excess brewed coffee to produce a refreshingly fizzy chilled drink. </p><p>Iris Farm, which is open to guests at fixed times of the day, is also home to some 250 free-roaming chickens, ducks and geese, a herd of goats and some rabbits. The rabbits were initially brought in to be reared for food, but nobody had the heart to slaughter them so they have become farm pets, much to the delight of guests, particularly children, says Gabino. </p><p>In March, newborn kid Johan became the farm's mascot after he was rejected by the herd. These days, the good-natured goat can sometimes be spotted tottering around after its adopted \"father\", Khun Phong, a gardener at the farm, and will happily accept head pats from visitors. </p><p>Meat products are carefully considered, too, and more than 70 per cent of ingredients are sourced locally. Seafood is bought from local fishermen and the resort's in-house butcher works with a satellite farm to rear and slaughter pigs. The pork is then cut and portioned by the resort's butcher and, Galea says with pride, the entire animal save for the kidneys is used for food. </p><p>The Conrad Koh Samui also holds by-appointment-only butchery sessions for guests - complete with alcohol shots for Dutch courage - to offer a sobering behind-the-scenes insight into how meat is processed for the dining table. </p><p>There are, of course, choice cuts of pork chops served at Azure or in curries at southern Thai restaurant Zest, and the team also makes sausages and bacon for breakfast. Pig bones are boiled for stock and the heads turned into terrines for Jahn. </p><p>Galea is experimenting with making cured meats such as guanciale, speck and chorizo - the samples I tasted were as good as those made by artisans - in a repurposed wine fridge, and hopes to ramp up production. Meanwhile, fresh salmon is being smoked in-house for the breakfast buffet because Galea could not find commercial smoked salmon that met his exacting standards at the right price. </p><p>Ultimately, says Gabino, the goal is to achieve better quality products for guests. </p><p>\"Being self-sufficient and compounding our current assets has been vital for us,\" he says. \"We know exactly where and how our fruits and vegetables are produced, and we can promise high-quality throughout ... </p><p>\"There is a special joy in taking care of your own food supply.

Due to the specific ingredients required for the cuisine he cooks, he also has to source from trusted partners in Latin America and across Asia - but he tries to lessen his environmental impact as much as possible. </p><p>\"For me, cooking sustainably starts with knowing where your produce comes from and working with products that are ethically sourced,\" he said. For Chaneton, this means ensuring his partners share his values: \"That's the basic standard I set for our cuisine at Mono.\" </p><p>The restaurant has partnered with Zero Foodprint Asia to provide grants that support farmers for healthy soil projects, and with Future Green, a food sustainability programme that provides sustainability assessments for the food and beverage sector. </p><p>Mono is just one of the leading lights of sustainability in Hong Kong. Penicillin, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/leisure/article/3106081/hong-kongs-first-sustainable-bar-penicillin-second-hand\">Hong Kong's first bar that champions a closed-loop model of production</url>, charts a path for more sustainable bartending through a philosophy that includes upcycling ingredients and minimising its carbon footprint. </p><p>The award-winning bar is launching a new menu starring 10 cocktails all made with a zero-waste approach. \"We use every cocktail ingredient to its full potential to reduce waste and close that loop,\" explained co-founder Agung Prabowo. \"Squeezing juice from a citrus fruit is a popular way to add acidity to a serving, but peel the rind and you can use it to make zesty syrups, garnishes, Oleo Saccharum or home-made limoncello and add it back into other cocktail ingredients.\" </p><p>Further proof that Hong Kong's fine dining restaurants have been making real strides has come from Michelin inspectors. Amber and Roganic are trailblazing icons of sustainability in the city - both have received Michelin Green Stars, awarded for maintaining ethical and environmental standards. </p><p>\"We prioritise sourcing from predominantly organic local and regional farms to reduce the carbon footprint. This fully traceable, sustainable, regenerative, organic, local or regional sourcing of ingredients is one of the key initiatives that sets us apart from most restaurants in Hong Kong,\" Richard Ekkebus, culinary director at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, where Amber is based, told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/well-being/article/3195951/how-hong-kong-fine-dining-finally-got-green-conscious\">Style by SCMP last year</url>. </p><p>Ekkebus has set up a three-pillared approach to sustainability: society, sourcing and environment. Under the pillar of society, the focus is on the well-being of staff at Amber and the hotel, and giving back to society, for example through supporting charities. He's expanding the restaurant's ethical sourcing by, for example, only obtaining sugar through Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and Bonsucro, and continuing to ensure all animal proteins are free roaming or organic and free of growth hormones and antibiotics. </p><p>Under the pillar of environment, Ekkebus is adamant about minimising waste and is now looking to find circular solutions for polystyrene: \"One of the limitations here is facilitating waste segregation and circular waste solutions. There are a limited number of suppliers focusing on ecolabel and organic products, but it's still a niche demand at the moment. The positive side is that interest is growing.\" </p><p>Roganic chef Ashley Salmon shares Ekkebus's frustrations with waste. \"Recycling and composting can be difficult as there are only a few providers,\" he explained. </p><p>Those 3,000 tonnes of food waste that go to landfill every day decompose, giving off methane, which is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The team at Roganic is now exploring different ways to do their own composting, reduce waste and trying to work with more new farmers in the New Territories. </p><p>The restaurant grows herbs in hydroponic cabinets inside the dining room and has a zero waste philosophy, transforming offcuts into new dishes and drinks. It reduces plastics by requiring suppliers to adhere to eco-friendly practices and, like Mono and Amber, has a filtration system to avoid using bottled water. </p><p>In April this year, another Green Star was awarded to Mora, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/3211107/what-good-restaurant-design-experts-hong-kong-reveal-how-they-approach-projects-and-effect-it-can\">soy-focused hotspot</url> tucked among the antique stalls of Upper Lascar Row in Sheung Wan. This brings the city's total to three Green Stars, putting it in decent company - the same number as Seoul and London, and two more than Bangkok. There is work to be done, though, if the city is to match Tokyo, which has 12, and Paris, which has seven Green Stars. </p><p>Mora, by chef-proprietor Vicky Lau - who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3135592/how-hong-kongs-two-michelin-star-chef-vicky-lau-became\">also helms the two-Michelin-starred Tate Dining Room</url> - pushes a range of sustainability initiatives, including reducing waste, energy consumption and the use of plastic, and is known for its promotion of local ingredients and culture. </p><p>While she uses non-genetically modified soybeans from Canada, many of the other ingredients she sources locally or regionally. Fruits and vegetables come from local organic farms, of which there are more than 300 in Hong Kong. For chicken, she works closely with local farms to ensure the meat is of the highest quality, while seafood is from a mix of local and regional sources. </p><p>\"We use threadfin and salted fish from around Asia, as well as seasonal cuttlefish. We also use a wide variety of spices and condiments, such as bean paste, to add flavour and depth to our dishes,\" Lau said. </p><p>Lau believes that the underappreciated ingredient of soy has the potential to encourage people to eat less meat. The production of meat has an outsize negative impact on the environment - a major study published in 2021 in online journal Nature Food found that meat accounts for nearly 60 per cent of all the greenhouse gases produced during food production. </p><p>This was a fact Ekkebus was well aware of when he introduced a sharp reduction in animal products to Amber back in 2019. The restaurant has since been entirely dairy-free and works to a ratio of 35/65 per cent of animal protein to plant-based ingredients in the menus. </p><p>It's one thing for individual restaurants to try and go green, it's another to shift a massive global organisation towards greater sustainable practices. Marriott International, with over 8,000 properties worldwide, is leading the charge among global players in the city. </p><p>\"Sustainability is a top priority for the company,\" according to Richard Taffs, Marriott's market vice-president for luxury, Greater China. \"The larger the company, the more difficult it is. But our drive for sustainability comes from the very top.\" </p><p>Marriott restaurants take their F&amp;B seriously. Not for nothing did restaurants like Tin Lung Heen (The Ritz-Carlton), Man Ho (JW Marriott) and L'Envol and R\u00f9n (St. Regis) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/100-top-tables/article/3215499/100-best-restaurants-hong-kong-2023-revealed-complete-100-top-tables-winners-list-celebrates-citys\">earn a spot in this year's 100 Top Tables guide</url>. </p><p>Taffs explains that through programmes such as Serve 360 and Mesh (Marriott Environmental Sustainability Hub), sustainability is at the forefront of the company's operations. \"It's the first question we ask of any menu we're putting together or of any project. 'What are our sustainable options?',\" he explained, before documenting how responsible sourcing, using cage-free eggs, certified seafood and improving food waste management are just some of the policies Marriott have introduced to improve their environmental impact. </p><p>Marriott's Greater China team also runs a sustainability committee that meets monthly and organises conference calls on new topics or programmes, which run out of the Hong Kong office. \"Sustainability is challenging,\" admitted Taffs. \"In Hong Kong, we have to import nearly everything. So we are doing a fantastic job on food miles? No. But in regards to food waste, we are. In other areas like soap recycling we lead the way in Hong Kong. So there are pluses and minuses in each location. And it's the right thing to do. As a company, it would be high risk if we weren't morally responsible.\" </p><p>While moves toward greater sustainability should always be applauded, and some of Hong Kong's finest restaurants these are leading the way, there is still a long way to go. </p><p>For Ekkebus, including the younger generations is key to speeding up the process of change and building a more sustainable future. \"Many more restaurants and hotels are taking the lead to employ various sustainable practices. However, Hong Kong is aiming to be carbon neutral before 2050 and the clock is ticking,\" he said. </p><p>\"Unfortunately, the changes are coming slow. We need education on sustainability to be a mandatory part of the school curriculum. We have to plant the seed with the young generation, and they will drive the change and educate the parents.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Want more stories like this?

Temperatures rarely hit extreme highs or lows, meaning yields tend to be excellent. </p><p>I have come to McLaren Vale to visit some of its green wineries, meet the owners and find out how they are preparing for climate breakdown, while acting as the designated driver for my wine-loving husband. </p><p>We begin at d'Arenberg, a name familiar to many wine aficionados. The largest biodynamic certified grower of wine grapes in Australia, d'Arenberg is in the centre of McLaren Vale. </p><p>It is also home to the d'Arenberg Cube, a five-storey multi-use building that rises above the mourv\u00e8dre vines and includes the Singapore Circus restaurant, a wine tasting room and the Alternate Realities Museum. </p><p>\"McLaren Vale is one of the most sustainable wine regions in Australia,\" says d'Arenberg owner Chester Osborn. \"At least 80 per cent sustainable - maybe not certified or registered, but certainly practising sustainability.\" </p><p>And what does biodynamic farming entail, exactly? I've read that lunar cycles and cow horns are somehow important. </p><p>\"Biodynamic doesn't have to be moon-related, but there are cow horns with poo involved,\" answers Osborn. \"It's all about microflora - it becomes a living breathing soil and breaks down carbon.\" </p><p>Osborn also relies on sheep grazing on the property, solar power and natural disease control to achieve a balance between environmental sustainability and cutting-edge production techniques. </p><p>Ten kilometres (six miles) east of d'Arenberg is Gemtree Wines, which runs a \"Being Biodynamic\" tour that starts in its tasting room, where visitors swirl, smell, sip and spit award-winning wines from the small-batch range. </p><p>We are guided through the farming, grape-growing and winemaking processes, which have earned Gemtree medals for sustainable practice at the Best of Wine Tourism Awards. </p><p>At the Biodynamic Hut, guests discover how the philosophy is applied in the fields: how sheep replace pesticides to keep weeds under control; how ground quartz prevents fungal infections, negating the need for chemical fungicides; and how those cow horns, stuffed with manure, restore carbon to the soil. </p><p>At tour's end, our bellies full of cheese and with hope for a better world, we leave with a case of first-release albari\u00f1o and head for Paxton Wines, which is just off the main Victor Harbor Road. </p><p>Paxton has been pioneering organic grape growing and wine production since 2011. At a tasting in its solar-powered cellar door - a renovated sheepshearing shed with a vaulted ceiling and seating around a cosy fireplace - we learn that the winery uses only grapes grown on its McLaren Vale estate, which is irrigated with recycled water. </p><p>Paxton is another producer that manages its grapes biodynamically, with a focus on promoting healthy, living soils through the use of natural compost preparation and the removal of synthetic fertilisers. </p><p>Its bottles are now made of lightweight glass, reducing its carbon footprint in glass production and freight by up to 30 per cent. Labels are made from paper produced from sugar-cane waste, and recycled cardboard is used for wine cartons. </p><p>A 10-minute drive south of Paxton Wines, Hither &amp; Yon, housed in the whitewashed old butcher's shop on Willunga High Street, is where I meet Malcolm Leask. </p><p>He and his brother, Richard, are producers of highly regarded, small-batch wines (Hither &amp; Yon's 2021 Aglianico won the McLaren Vale's best wine of show 2022 award), often releasing innovative varieties. </p><p>Hither &amp; Yon was the first wine brand to be certified carbon neutral in South Australia. </p><p>\"We care about our soil - so much so that we didn't want [the cellar door] at our winery, [to avoid] cars driving around our vines and producing emissions,\" says Leask. </p><p>\"We focus on improving our wine through the soil by using a regenerative agriculture model of farming, neither organic nor biodynamic, but following nature's rhythm.\" </p><p>The brothers have partnered with nearby Gemtree, which produces their wine, entrusting their grapes to like-minded artisans who operate with the lightest of touches. </p><p>\"Everything we do is within a small radius, which keeps us super-efficient,\" says Leask. \"Most of the region is [sustainability-minded]. It's what we all get out of bed for every day. </p><p>\"We understand, more than anyone, that this region is a beautiful, rare part of the planet [...] and we must look after it.\" </p><p>\"It's our identity, and what we want for the future generations.\" </p><p>I remember Leask's words as we finish the day with a swim in the crisp waters off Aldinga beach. </p><p>The following day we visit the small and nimble Battle of Bosworth, producer of organically grown and certified wines from family-owned vineyards since 1999 and the first to be certified organic in the area. </p><p>According to the website, Joch Bosworth, who owns the winery with partner Louise Hemsley-Smith, experiments but remains true to traditional vinification: minimal, natural processing combined with organic, sustainable viticulture. </p><p>\"Times have certainly changed,\" says Bosworth. \"I remember when it was seen as a negative to have 'organic' written on your label, largely due to them being poorly made. </p><p>\"It's different now; farmers are now viticulturalists and winemakers - they know how to make great-tasting organic wine and people are interested in natural products. </p><p>\"As the organic wine and biodynamic producers become more serious, more people collaborate with real passion and skills.

Based on ABAC work program in 2022 and major trends in the Asia-Pacific region, the Sustainability Working Group will continue to work on the three priorities in 2022, namely climate change, renewable energy and food security, with focuses on three areas: \"Building Net-Zero Economy and Promoting Green Recovery in APEC, Advancing Realistic Energy Transition towards Low Carbon in APEC, and Fostering a Sustainable Food System that Ensures Food Security and Safety in APEC.\"</p><p>At the meeting, Frank Ning submitted a proposal on \"Accelerating Chemical Technology Innovation and the Global Low-carbon Transition.\" He stated that the chemical industry is an important part of the modern industrial system, accounting for about 17% of the value of global industrial output. Additionally, as a typical high energy-consuming industry, the chemical industry is also an important source of carbon emissions and faces greater difficulty in cutting emissions. As an important low-carbon solution provider, the chemical industry has launched a series of technological innovation initiatives that not only help the chemical industry save energy and reduce carbon emissions, but also facilitate the low-carbon transformation of other industrial chains through chemical solutions.</p><p>Presently, leading chemical companies such as BASF and Sinochem Holdings are continuously innovating and contributing to low-carbon solutions. Sinochem Holdings in particular is actively exploring and applying energy-saving and carbon-reducing technological measures that are focused on carbon capture, utilization and storage technology (CCUS), carbon dioxide-based chemicals and hydrogen energy. These measures have achieved certain results but require additional industrial and policy support to accelerate the application of advanced technologies.</p><p>Frank Ning raised five recommendations for the low-carbon transformation of the chemical industry.

Agriculture is the most water-intensive industrial sector in China, consuming around 60 per cent of national water withdrawal. </p><p>The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that China may face more groundwater depletion due to climate change. Less rain and hotter weather will increase the need for crop irrigation while the country might face more water scarcity, the panel noted. </p><p>The warming temperatures are also affecting other cash crops globally.

When <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1294590/franken-meat-fails-taste-test-worlds-first-stem-cell-grown-burger\">Professor Mark Post of Maastricht University, in the Netherlands, made the first cultivated meat burger</url> back in 2013, it cost US$330,000. </p><p>At Huber's Butchery, every dish of cultivated chicken, which is priced the same as a dish of regular chicken (about S$18/US$13.60), is subsidised by Good Meat. </p><p>The high cost is the main reason that, two-and-a-half years after the Singaporean government gave the all-clear to Good Meat, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3212497/lab-grown-meat-slow-start-singapore-fish-maw-races-chicken-profitability\">the cultivated chicken is not more widely available</url>. </p><p>\"The biggest challenges are the technical and scientific challenges of scaling up production and bringing down costs to make cultivated meat,\" says Andrew Noyes, vice-president at Eat Just. </p><p>The new factory parent company Good Meat has built in Singapore, with its 6,000-litre bioreactor that is the largest known vessel for avian and mammalian cell culture, should increase scalability and lower manufacturing costs, however. </p><p>Unlike Good Meat, whose Singapore strategy is to introduce the public to cultivated meats in an affordable way, some companies are targeting the high end. </p><p>Hong Kong gourmet products, such as Avant Meats' fish maw, could turn a profit sooner than everyday meats such as chicken. </p><p>Upside Foods has partnered with chef <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2175767/netflix-chefs-table-star-dominique-crenn-earns-three-michelin\">Dominique Crenn</url>, who is set to become the first in the US to serve their cultivated chicken at her restaurant Bar Crenn. </p><p>The French-born chef took meat off the menu at all three of her restaurants in 2018, including three-Michelin-star Atelier Crenn in San Francisco. </p><p>\"I thought, 'Woah!', when I first heard about cultivated meat, but if lab-grown chicken helps to make a better world, then that's good. And it tastes great,\" she says. </p><p>Partnerships with leading chefs will also help to assuage the public's fears over cultivated meats being \"unnatural\", worries that proponents counter with examples of factory farms, where animals are raised in cramped, unsanitary conditions and loaded with antibiotics and hormones. </p><p>\"There's nothing unnatural about cells growing this way - it's actually purer and cleaner than conventional, factory-farmed chicken,\" says Yeo. </p><p>Crenn is not the only chef backing cultivated meats; Good Meats has partnered with Spanish-American chef and restaurateur Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s in the US. Andr\u00e9s is known for his work on sustainability and global food security. </p><p>By 2050, when the United Nations predicts the global population will reach 9.8 billion, global demand for meat is set to nearly double. Animal farming already accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>Finding more environmentally friendly ways to feed the planet is therefore crucial. </p><p>A study published in the The Inter\u00ad\u00adnational Journal of Life Cycle Assessment concludes that cultivated meat has the potential to have less environmental impact than conventional meat. </p><p>It is almost three times more efficient in turning crops into meat than chicken, the most efficient animal. Agricultural land use is low, which also helps to preserve biodiversity, and it emits less nitrogen and other polluting gases. </p><p>Cultivated meat production is energy-intensive, however. Bioreactors require a constant temperature and the biotechnological production of culture medium ingredients is energy-hungry. </p><p>Were a plant to be powered by renewable energy sources, the carbon footprint would be lower than for beef and pork, and comparable to the ambitious benchmark of chicken, the study found. </p><p>Another cutting-edge food technology that has the potential to minimise the need for animal farming is precision fermentation, a process that has been used for the past 50 years to produce antibiotics, vitamins and insulin. </p><p>In this technique, micro-organisms are programmed to make complex organic molecules, such as proteins. </p><p>A growing array of food is now being made using this process, in particular cow-free dairy products such as milk and ice cream. US-based Helaina is even using precision fermentation to \"brew\" human breast milk in microbes. </p><p>Perfect Day, a California-based company that makes dairy products using precision fermentation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3119324/li-ka-shing-backed-start-perfect-day-launches-asias-first-animal\">first launched animal-free ice creams in Hong Kong in 2021</url>. Its brand, Ice Age!, was backed by Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures, and was Asia's first animal-free dairy ice cream. </p><p>It launched Asia's first cow-free milk, Very Dairy, in Singapore in November 2022, and in Hong Kong this summer. It is antibiotic-, hormone-, cholesterol- and lactose-free. </p><p>\"As there are no animals used to make our whey protein, we don't have the same level of risk of animal-derived pathogens,\" says Alex Brittain, senior vice-president at Perfect Day. </p><p>It had previously launched in the US before coming East. While Asia, largely through Singapore, has been at the forefront of the development of the cultivated meat market, and many Asia-based companies are innovating with their own cultivated meat products, there are fewer companies in the region making products through precision fermentation. </p><p>Michal Klar, founding partner of Better Bite Ventures, a fund investing in early-stage alternative protein start-ups in Asia-Pacific, says Asia's low-dairy diets may be the reason. </p><p>\"In Asia, cultivated meat start-ups are more common and more developed compared with the ones working on precision fermentation. </p><p>\"One of the reasons might be that precision fermentation technology is currently mostly used to develop dairy proteins, that is whey and casein. Dairy is generally a smaller category compared with meat in most Asian markets,\" he says. \"India is a notable exception.\" </p><p>Two prominent precision fermentation start-ups in India are Zero Cow Factory and Phyx44. Perfect Day has also set up local manufacturing in India. </p><p>While Asia lags behind in home-grown precision fermentation products, it is proving a leader when it comes to regulations. Finnish food-tech start-up Solar Foods received regulatory approval in Singapore to sell a powder called Solein in September 2022. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3210041/singapore-trial-protein-made-thin-air-could-solve-worlds-food-problem\">Solein is billed as the world's most sustainable protein, as it effectively makes protein from air</url> rather than soil, bypassing the need for photosynthesis. </p><p>To produce Solein, water is split using renewable electricity into hydrogen and oxygen. </p><p>Single-celled organisms (a type of soil bacteria) are fed carbon dioxide, hydrogen and mineral nutrients, to create a biomass. This biomass is dried to a powder, making Solein mainly the desiccated bodies of bacteria. </p><p>The first-ever public tasting of Solein took place at Fico restaurant in Singapore in late May. Chef and sustainability advocate Oliver Truesdale-Jutras and chef Mirko Febbrile created a five-course tasting menu, including a Kansai-style <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ozoni</emphasis> (a miso-based soup enjoyed in the morning on New Year's Day in Japan), smoked pumpkin with Solein salted egg sauce, and Solein ice cream with figs and fig <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vincotto</emphasis> (a cooked fig liquid). </p><p>Febbrile, previously with Michelin-starred Braci, has also launched a Solein chocolate gelato, available at Fico. </p><p>Solar Foods chief executive officer and partner Pasi Vainikka likened the tasting event to when the Spanish first encountered the potato in the 16th century in South America. </p><p>\"This is the first time in history humankind can be provided with edible calories that at no point require photosynthesis. So far photosynthetic plants have been the only feasible way to receive energy from the sun to feed humankind,\" said Vainikka in a press statement. \"Now, this process can be bypassed in its entirety. </p><p>\"That's an absolutely historic moment. A new era begins in the primary production of food and restoring biodiversity.\" </p><p>Some environmentalists see technology as the key to protecting nature and improving human well-being. The more radical call for the end of animal farming entirely. </p><p>Other environmentalists support a return to more traditional, regenerative forms of farming and are wary of technology, particularly when it comes to who controls it. </p><p>Others take a middle path. </p><p>\"We're not trying to replace milk from cows grazing regeneratively,\" says Brittain. \"Our part of the solution - precision fermentation for dairy - needs to come to the fore alongside other solutions, whether that's regenerative agriculture, plant-based options, which have been doing a good job of converting some consumers, or precision fermentation, which feels like it's next in terms of readiness to scale. </p><p>\"Cellular [cultivated meat], depending on which study you read, will likely get to scale and impact in the next eight to 10 years. </p><p>\"But at the heart of all these initiatives is the same driving force: sustainably produced protein.

RE:FARM will run from September 2022 to June 2023 and consumers can personally see, touch, and taste the results of the Nespresso's sustainability efforts. The program is the result of a partnership between Nespresso, K11 and Common Farms, a local indoor agri-tech farm, and is aligned with the sustainability initiatives of parent group Nestl\u00e9 SA and its commitment to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come. </p><p><br/><br/>Nespresso has always done things a certain way. Not the easiest way, not the quickest. But the right way. Since its inception over 30 years ago, Nespresso has remained steadfastly committed to making a difference in the world, and sustainability has become a crucial component of its business today. By embedding transformative actions throughout its value chain, such as regenerative agriculture, eco-design, recycling, and circularity, Nespresso strives to bring positive impact to all its stakeholders, from farmers and business partners to consumers. In 2022, Nespresso was certified as a B Corp and joined a global movement of companies doing business responsibly and transparently while maintaining high sustainability standards. <br/><br/>From Capsule to Cup to Table (and back!) \u2013 A Circular Journey <br/><br/>At RE:FARM, visitors have a unique opportunity to witness Nespresso's sustainable circular system in action. An on-site recycler separates coffee capsules from the coffee grounds and recycles the aluminum to make second life products. Meanwhile, Nespresso's composter turns spent coffee grounds into rich nutrients that will be used to bring life to new produce. Composted coffee grounds serve as an excellent fertilizer and offer numerous benefits in farming, such as improved soil drainage, water retention, and aeration. They also acidify the soil, acting as a natural repellent that deters pests from damaging crops. RE:FARM uses this compost to grow a variety of herbs, microgreens, and edible flowers within self-contained farming units, which are later harvested and sent to selected Nespresso partner restaurants in K11 MUSEA and Rosewood Hong Kong, including Asaya Kitchen, Chaat, Deng G, Yung's Bistro, and other dining establishments that will be joining the project over its nine-month run. As part of the RE:FARM experience, customers are invited to savor the products of Nespresso's circular journey through delicious microgreens and herbs harvested from RE:FARM in specially designed menus available at participating restaurants. <br/><br/>Through a journey that sees resources travel from farm to capsule to cup, and back to the farm, Nespresso's own circular economy aims to transform the \"take-make-waste\" model into a sustainable system that maintains value and minimizes waste.  <br/><br/>Nespresso hopes to leave visitors with a new understanding and appreciation for circularity through RE:FARM, where end-of-life materials are reimagined and reused as resources rather than waste. In promoting restoration and regeneration, Nespresso continues to hold fast to its commitment to create long-term, positive impact in the world. <br/><br/>Coffee as a Force for Good <br/><br/>Nespresso's sustainability journey continues to evolve in new and innovative ways. Through inspiring initiatives such as RE:FARM and an unwavering determination to continuously maximize its positive impact, the company remains committed to caring for communities, the climate, and circularity with the same dedication and passion that goes into every cup of Nespresso coffee. Because it is the right thing to do. <br/><br/>Located adjacent to Nespresso's existing K11 MUSEA store, RE:FARM will be open from September 2022 to June 2023.

Launched in 2003 in collaboration with the NGO Rainforest Alliance and later joined by Fairtrade International, the program helps to improve the yield and quality of harvests, ensuring a sustainable supply of high-quality coffee and improving livelihoods of farmers and their communities. Headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, Nespresso operates in 84 countries and has over 14,250 employees. In 2019, it operated a global retail network of 810 boutiques. For more information, visit the Nespresso corporate website:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nestle-nespresso.com\">www.nestle-nespresso.com</url> . <br/><br/>About the Nespresso Recycling Programme <br/><br/>Nespresso capsules are made of aluminium which is the best material to protect the freshness and quality of our coffee. Importantly, aluminum is an infinitely recyclable material. We encourage our Members to participate in recycling their used capsules either by bringing them back to our Boutiques in Hong Kong, or through the Recycling@Home  initiative, give those used Nespresso capsules to your deliveryman. <br/><br/>Once collected, used Nespresso capsules are taken to a local plant where the aluminium is separated from the coffee residue. The shredded aluminium is sent to a scrap metal collector for further re-melting into recycled aluminium, while the Nespresso coffee grounds separated from the aluminium capsules are sent to a local farm in the New Territories for further processing into farm compost. <br/><br/>About B Corp<br/><br/>B Corp is a community of companies that commit to have a positive impact on the world \u2013 for the environment, the people who work for their businesses and in their supply chains, and for the communities where they operate.

I was surprised when I found out that you are also farming here. We probably have different reasons for doing it. Can you tell me yours?\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I often associate it with age and consciousness. In the farm, we have three partners, I am the youngest, not that I am going to tell you my age [laughs]. </p><p>\"My oldest friend in Hong Kong [Christophe Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my], who I have known for 27 years, has always been into these things. He is an architect and an entomologist. </p><p>\"Two years ago, I was teaching a course on biodiversity and design and I contacted him about it. He said, 'I have no time for your project. Biodiversity doesn't need design anyway. And on top of that, I'm planning to do a regenerative farming project.' </p><p>\"I went to see him and chatted to him about how we can contribute to the idea of regenerative agriculture - farming in a holistic way that returns nutrients to the soil. For him, as an architect, building didn't make sense any more. </p><p>\"A third partner, John Tang, also an architect, joined the project. John, a bit older than us, was doing amazing buildings in Hong Kong and mainland China, but maybe he didn't feel it was meaningful enough in addressing the crises we are facing. </p><p>\"So that's why I say it comes with age, because maybe you need to reach a certain maturity to want to reinvent yourself as something else and to act upon essential commitments for the planet.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"For us, the social movement was the entry point. We were in the anti-high-speed-rail protest movement and we were hoping to reform society. Then after the movement was over, the longer journey turned out to be the reformation of ourselves. </p><p>\"It sounds old-fashioned, but that's what it has been. We are in a collective and we have seen how each one has grown. And we have learned to work with each other. </p><p>\"For example, if we're doing a task, we know we'll have different opinions, especially on how we engage with nature. We have a lot of fire ants in Hong Kong. In the beginning, some of us would say they were harmful to our practice and we had to get rid of them. Others would say they had lives, too, and we should keep them, and so on. </p><p>\"Sometimes the conflicts would explode but it's not common because we are quite peaceful. And to me, maybe because of my background as a journalist, I feel I am also an observer. </p><p>\"Two years ago, on the 10th anniversary of the farm, I made an hour-long video called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Days Before the Silent Spring</emphasis> and recorded how members of the team felt about farming and how it had changed them. </p><p>\"Making a record is one way I see my artistic practice. But Mr Yuen, our <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sifu</emphasis>, who taught us how to farm, asked me this question at the time: 'Why do you think you are so important that this all needs recording?' </p><p>\"Maybe it's not very significant to other people.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"One importance is to record all this knowledge. Traditional knowledge of farming is disappearing globally. It is important to preserve it, to record it and to make sure that this is transmitted [partly because the old ways of farming were more ecological]. So that's why you and I both have educational activities on our farms. </p><p>\"The goal of farming is obviously to grow vegetables, but also to grow better human beings.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"We try to speak to the public about food ethics and sufficiency. But when we look at reality, I feel conflicted. The way we farm is privileged. </p><p>\"For example, last year we had some bad harvests and didn't have enough produce for customers. In the past, we might have had 40 to 50 packages [of mixed vegetables] a week to sell to customers. It wasn't a lot but it covered our rent. But sometimes we would have only 20 packages a week even though we tried very hard. </p><p>\"I'm not on the farm full time. I am doing exhibitions. I am starting a full-time, paid PhD partly to get some financial stability. </p><p>\"It's embarrassing when farmers in places like India commit suicide due to being overwhelmed by debt. We know what farming could mean for us: to be independent, to say how you can live on your own terms. But as an individual I know I won't solve any problems. </p><p>\"That's why in my artwork I am always debating with my own self. In Hong Kong, we try hard, but in reality bad things still happen. I feel hopeless sometimes.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I haven't found a way to translate the sensibility of farming into an artistic format yet, but it is a similar type of process. Farming is a form of engagement and the sharing of values. It is also an attempt to reorganise society. </p><p>\"Among the most important needs for an individual is obviously how you sustain yourself, feed yourself and your family. Historically, the invention of the state matched the invention of agriculture. And when food supply is delocalised - like in Hong Kong - food sovereignty becomes important. </p><p>\"If people start to have food sovereignty, society and relationships become less hierarchical. In Hong Kong, it is almost an impossible dream because the gap between imports and what we produce is so big, but nevertheless, you can start to engage and bring in the conversation. </p><p>\"In fact, if politics is a way to engage and view society, I will say farming is a political act.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"How we see it is getting back to basics: a less capitalistic way of how society operated in the old days, [one] based more on equal exchanges. </p><p>\"We also consider how we cooperate with others - institutions, companies and our customers. Who are they and are they actually against our beliefs? Are we just greenwashing together?\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I remember during the Occupy movement of 2014, there was a garden that Occupiers set up below a Lennon Wall. The new generation don't want to go back to a village type of life, but a big issue for young people in Hong Kong, Japan and elsewhere is whether they will live more miserably than their parents and their grandparents. Do I get myself a bulls**t job, live in the city and not be able to afford a decent life? </p><p>\"So, 2014 was the tip of the iceberg. The garden, the Lennon Wall represented the same logic: a space for claiming something that you feel is right.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"It's hard in Hong Kong for people to grow their own food, and farming is tough. When I first got into farming I was pretty fit because I had always exercised and always liked hiking. But I was exhausted. </p><p>\"You may think of the perfect model of a farmer - like getting up early, having healthy food, having routine. Well, that's the projection. We try to achieve that.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Post Mag</emphasis>: What are you growing? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"We are planting cabbage, broccoli, carrots, lettuce, beetroots, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">gai lan</emphasis> and snow peas. </p><p>\"We have tried two kinds of local [heirloom] rice varieties, including one called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">lo su ngar</emphasis> [rat's teeth], but it is very hard to harvest because the stalks are very tall. It's like a messy hair day, especially after a storm. </p><p>\"We will keep growing the Taiwanese and Indonesian strains though.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"All sorts of local and non-local vegetables. Soon we will move to cucumbers and green beans. </p><p>\"There are so many possibilities to make things wrong. The goal in farming is not to make things right; it is to remove what makes things wrong. </p><p>\"Hong Kong is OK when it comes into season. We can almost do three seasons [of farming], though when you are in the field in the summer and it's 35 degrees [95 degrees Fahrenheit] you feel it!\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"Attitudes have changed. Friends who weren't interested in farming are now keen to understand more. To them, the [anti-high-speed-rail] movement had nothing to do with them. But after the last three years, how they see the institutional system, how cynical and ridiculous it is, they want to find their own path.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I have many mainland students whose parents were in lengthy lockdowns in Chinese cities and they had no food. So there was a lot of interest in subsistence farming among those students. </p><p>\"We always have the possibility of a food crisis here.

The food price index of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 2021 averaged 125.7 points, as much as 27.6 points above the previous year with all five sub-indices (i.e., cereal, vegetable, dairy, meat, and sugar) averaging sharply higher than in 2020. Among these sub-indices, cereal prices have experienced an even more considerable rise. The FAO cereal price index in 2021 was the highest annual average registered since 2012, which averaged 131.2 points, up 28.0 points from 2020.</p><p>Since the 20th century, there have been several global food price crises. During the 1970s oil price crisis, the prices of staple foods, especially rice, rose by more than 100 percent, causing a severe global food crisis. An oil embargo from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries caused a spike in oil prices by nearly 300 percent over several months. Although the food price spike closely followed oil prices, the drivers of the crisis can be considered a perfect storm of events, including conflict, trade restrictions, macroeconomic shocks and extreme weather events. During the 2007-08 food price crisis, the prices of staple foods surged, with the rice price doubling in the span of a few months. This food crisis was led by several factors such as demand for biofuels and grain export restrictions, combined with weather shocks and possible financial speculation.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the compounding effects from a coincidence of significant risks and threats, including emerging diseases, trade chokepoints and disruptions, macroeconomic shocks, conflicts, climate change, extreme weather events, and degradation and depletion of natural resources and the loss of biodiversity, are seriously disrupting the food system. It is estimated that 30 percent of the global population lacked access to adequate food in 2020\uff0da rise of 320 million in just one year. Sharply rising food prices offer few means of substitution, especially for net food buyers and the urban poor, increasing hunger, poverty and malnutrition. Food price spikes, reduced incomes and compounded risks (the perfect storm discussed above) will lead to severe and widespread increases in global food insecurity, affecting vulnerable households in almost every country.</p><p>The recent food price spikes come from both the supply side and the demand side. On the supply side, the continuous COVID-19 pandemic, frequent extreme weather events, and high input costs have tightened global food supply. Outbreaks of diseases lower crop production, disrupt food processing, distribution, transportation and trade substantially. In addition, weather shocks due to climate change and natural disasters are affecting crops worldwide. Driven by surging energy costs, supply curtailments and trade policies, fertilizer prices increased sharply since the third quarter of 2021, reaching their highest levels since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, which could exert inflationary pressures on food prices.</p><p>On the demand side, the energy price surge, and consequently strong demand for biofuels, has been a major factor in the recent price spikes. The global pattern of lagging production and limited investment helped push oil prices to nearly $85 per barrel in January 2022, a 50 percent increase compared with the previous year. As a result, a strong demand-side surge for biofuels exerted strong pressure on food prices, especially that of maize. Global demand for biofuels is set to grow by 41 billion liters, or 28 percent, over 2021-26. In addition, macroeconomic factors such as decreasing interest rates, relaxation of monetary policy, increasing investment in commodity funds (speculation) and the depreciation of the US dollar exacerbated the food price spike.</p><p>There is widespread concern that the recent food price spikes will cause a global hunger and nutrition crisis. Measures from a short-term perspective and a long-term perspective must be taken.</p><p>In the short term, green channels need to be established and maintained to ensure food supply. City lockdowns, road blocks and social distancing should not prevent foods from being transported and marketed while food chain workers must be protected against the pandemic. The government should also monitor and stabilize wholesale and retail food prices at the national and regional levels. Efficient and timely public communication and guidance is also essential to stabilize market expectations.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that the global food trade plays a crucial role during food supply shocks; food export bans and restrictions should be eliminated or subjected to stricter disciplines in their use to stabilize global food prices and ensure food security. Thus, global governance mechanisms and institutional coordination capacity must be further strengthened. Other instruments include formulating policies to prevent food price rises caused by biofuels, offering temporary special support to smallholders, farmers and small traders, and providing social protection for vulnerable people, such as women, children and the elderly.</p><p>In the long term, investment in rural infrastructure and irrigation and drainage needs to be promoted. Measures include scaling up productive and regenerative agriculture, redirecting subsidy policies to climate-smart, eco-friendly, impactful public investments, and promoting multiple-win technologies such as yield-enhancing, nutrition improving and conservation technologies.</p><p>To cope with food price spikes and to mitigate their negative influence on global food security, it is crucial to transform toward more sustainable and resilient global food system. This requires promoting the sustainable intensification of agriculture to halt the expansion of food production to natural habitats of wild animals and plants; incorporating a One Health approach to encourage a collaborative effort across disciplines for the optimal health of people, animals and the environment; moving to other forms of green energy to address the risk of oil price shocks; stabilizing macroeconomic policies and building buffers between macroeconomic policy instability and food systems.</p><p>To match the increased scope of global action required to address and respond to risks and threats, a scientific platform for food systems comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is needed to provide the basis for food systems transformation at a global level and provide independent, evidence-based advice for decision-making and actions.</p><p>Fan Shenggen is dean of the Academy of Global Food Economics and Policy and chair professor at China Agricultural University.

It was followed by market reforms in the 1980s and agricultural trade reforms in the 1990s which furthered productivity and economic development.</p><p>Recently China has integrated human and environmental health into its development agenda. Collectively, the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development, and the Long-range Objectives Through the Year 2035, Healthy China 2030 Plan and Anti-Food Waste Law target awareness of public consumption, low-carbon rural development, healthy and balanced diets, food safety and environmental degradation related to livestock wastes, agricultural plastics and fertilizer use.</p><p>But policy is not enough on its own.

Slowing productivity growth, persistent micro-nutrient deficiencies, rapidly increasing obese and overweight populations, high health costs from diet-related non-communicable diseases, natural resource degradation, continued rural-urban and regional inequality, increased food imports and a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging China's ability to provide access to safe, healthy and sustainable foods.</p><p>Climate change is also a very real threat, as the extreme weather events of this year illustrate.

There are four ways China can contribute. First, prioritize research and development of innovations that reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture, boost productivity, ensure soil health and enhance nutrition.

Taxes can be imposed on unhealthy and unsustainable foods; and these funds can be used to support a sustainable transformation of the food system.</p><p>Third, overcome siloes and further integration. Sustainability, health, nutrition, equality and livelihoods cannot be separated. Institutional actors and government departments need to create coordination mechanisms to approach and act on these issues.</p><p>Last, influence behavior change.

China's economy has shown great resilience during and after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is expected to continue growing. For now and in the future, with China transitioning to a more innovative and sustainable development model, we expect to see many opportunities arise from the upgrading of the economy. That provides foreign investors and companies such as Hays with opportunities to develop together with China's economy. From our perspective as a global expert in recruitment, China is a massive market and there are a great number of jobs out there for us to locate and consult on.</p><p>DEPOUX: The Chinese production system has shown quite extraordinary resilience in the second half of 2020 and 2021. This has continued to 2022, even though it was disturbed by COVID-19 resurgences. The Chinese supply chain has modernized in 2021 thanks to accelerated investment in automation and digitalization, financed by the surge in demand. Yet, the situation going forward in 2023 is going to be different because the global economy is slowing down due to inflation, tightening monetary policies and the impact of high energy prices. International demand may weaken Chinese exports, but there is also a scenario by which energy shortages cause disruptions in industrial chains such as chemicals and commodities in Europe. China's production system may, again, be able to stabilize the global supply chain by picking up the demand that cannot be met in Europe.</p><p>BOZEC: We remain confident in China's economy, as China continues to be an important driving force for global development and prosperity. We have forged strong ties with our Chinese partners over our two decades in the market. We look forward to meeting and working with new partners as well as our existing network, and creating more value while contributing to China's economic growth.</p><p>Q2 China has been deepening its reform and opening-up policy, particularly at the institutional level, so as to ensure equal treatment and an optimized business environment for foreign companies operating in China, and to persuade more of them to invest in China and benefit from the country's thrust on tech and innovation. How do you view China's efforts? How can China intensify such efforts, particularly in the context of any potential external or internal barriers?</p><p>MUKUND: The achievements of China's 40 years of reform and opening-up have attracted worldwide attention. And Benchmark ESG is honored to be a part of this legendary development. As a leading provider of cloud-based ESG software solutions, we have been firmly optimistic about the market prospects since entering China in 2009. Benchmark ESG's investment in China has been growing alongside the country's growing emphasis on safety in production and ongoing digital transformation. At the beginning of a new stage, we hope China will continue to pursue greater opening-up at a higher level, to give MNCs more opportunities for development and achieve win-win results.</p><p>WU: We have greatly benefited from the continuously improving business environment in China. As an international logistics provider, the efficiency of Customs clearance is critically important for us. In recent years, Chinese Customs has introduced a series of measures and digitalized approaches to streamline and accelerate the Customs clearance process, which significantly improves efficiency. Going forward, China's continuous opening-up will ultimately lead to an improved business environment, and we are confident that the focus on sustainable development of the Chinese economy will greatly benefit international trade. DHL Express will continue the solid partnership with Sinotrans and invest to keep our business in China growing.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays has benefited from China's opening-up from the perspective of equal market entrance. In the past decades, we have established offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Suzhou, providing our services to both multinational and domestic companies. The most recent China International Fair for Trade in Services, along with many other major trade events, such as the China International Import Expo, are very good examples of China's efforts to create opportunities. Its ongoing efforts to optimize the business environment and its drive for fair competition have been providing more convenience for the operations of foreign investors and companies. As China continues to provide more stability and certainty for businesses, it will attract more foreign investors with its huge market potential.</p><p>DEPOUX: China has been emphasizing fostering a new development paradigm through high-level opening-up, and foreign business will continue to play an important role in China's future economy. Senior decision-makers from headquarters overseas need to understand and engage more with the Chinese market, and entrust further investment into it. This will not go without human exchanges, with short business travel as well as expatriates, experts and decision-makers in the country.</p><p>BOZEC: The expansion of China's high-level opening-up and reform of the business environment further enhances the attractiveness and resilience of the Chinese economy, making the Chinese market one of the most dynamic and influential in the world. The optimized business environment has spurred the vitality of companies and brands like ours, while the increasingly open market has created an excellent business environment for investment and growth of foreign enterprises.</p><p>We strongly believe that the promotion of a series of favorable policies for enterprises has fueled great momentum in the market. This has provided us with more opportunities to participate in the market's development and enhance communication with partners.</p><p>Q3 Innovation has been the bedrock of China's modernization. What new opportunities can you foresee for the world in China's pursuit of innovation-powered high-quality development?</p><p>MUKUND: In the past, China was often dubbed a big manufacturing power, but in recent years, we have seen more and more innovative icons in China: aerospace, artificial intelligence, new energy vehicles and more, and in many subsectors it has achieved curve overtaking and become a leader. It is not hard to imagine that China's existing huge manufacturing base, with policies and guidelines for innovation-driven high-quality development, will stimulate more vigorous modern market demands and foster broad employment opportunities while promoting the connectivity of a globalized economy, culture and technology, and create more possibilities for the sustainable development of human society.</p><p>WU: Technological innovation is a major driving force for cross-border e-commerce to achieve high-level development in the future. Currently, the emerging sector as a new form of foreign trade has huge development potential that not only stabilizes foreign trade amid global economic uncertainties, but also drives consumption growth and provides marketing opportunities, which further brings an increased demand for international logistics. With its worldwide network and breadth of industries served, DHL Express is able to accommodate fast-changing trade flows and facilitate the surge in cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>BURRAGE: China is now leading in many high-tech innovations, from information technology, the internet and artificial intelligence to smart manufacturing and biotech. With the innovation-driven development strategy, China is striving to become more independent in scientific research and R&amp;D of cutting-edge technology. The core of innovation is talent. At Hays, we have seen a substantial increase in talent in China's high-tech sectors. From the perspective of talent, sectors such as IT, AI, biotech, sustainability and smart manufacturing will continue to maintain enormous growth potential. Both employers and candidates will benefit from these opportunities.</p><p>DEPOUX: Looking forward, many opportunities are revolving around modernization and decarbonization in the Chinese economy. Since 2021, an increasing emphasis has been put on China's industrial modernization. The effort to peak and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 2060 is the key to maintaining competitiveness, and it will drive further acceleration of modernization. China has demonstrated its innovation capability and is leapfrogging and gaining leadership globally in areas such as the electric vehicle chain from batteries to charging infrastructure, solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines and nuclear and telecommunications equipment. We anticipate that in the near future, global competitiveness will be more and more driven by Chinese technological innovation.</p><p>BOZEC: China has bred many cutting-edge innovations, and its innovation capability in the digital economy is world-leading. Especially in the new retail environment, digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented speed across the industry, and online and offline integrated development has been dedicated to satisfying the public need for an enhanced experience and a better lifestyle.</p><p>For Tapestry, China is not only a vital market but also a source of inspiration for brands to seek innovation. We have built a strong local team for digital innovation, which we will continue to strengthen while working closely with local digital partners here.</p><p>Q4 What's your take on China's dual carbon goals, which have received a thumbs-up globally? Do you see big business opportunities arising from the country's carbon goals?</p><p>MUKUND: China's carbon peaking and neutrality goals demonstrate the courage of a responsible country, and have brought about a series of gratifying changes in the past few years. Take Benchmark ESG's field as an example: potential investors and regulators have higher requirements for corporate ESG performance, corporate leadership and asset managers are moving faster toward ESG, while both upstream and downstream supply chains are actively seeking industry upgrades. Benchmark ESG is both a beneficiary of the dual carbon goals and a supporter of China to achieve it.</p><p>WU: In the logistics industry, DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group have been pioneering green transition with a total of 7 billion euros ($6.88 billion) investment by 2030, dedicated to using clean energy, deploying technologies and building climate-neutral facilities to reduce carbon emissions. In China, we have followed the same path and have achieved some noticeable results. We're committed to achieving 60 percent electrification of pickup and delivery vehicles by 2030. The current rate has been over 20 percent. We've also been striving to greet 30 percent green fuel-using long-haul trucks. The test of the first pilot hydrogen fuel cell truck was launched this month in Shanghai.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays recognizes and supports China's emissions goals. It is a difficult yet responsible action taken by the largest developing country to protect the planet and our future generations. The push to rapidly reduce carbon emissions is creating more business opportunities. On the one hand, peaking and net-zero goals are generating new sectors, for example, electric vehicles and the carbon trade mechanism. On the other hand, we see that the carbon emissions goals are creating more job opportunities in the market, and creating new types of jobs. At Hays, we are seeing companies across sectors either being proactive or required to establish sustainability departments.</p><p>DEPOUX: We believe that China's dual carbon goals are critical to the world, and innovation is key to meeting the objectives. It will push State-owned, private companies and multinationals to set more audacious objectives - not only abide by the zero-emissions target, but also claim leadership in emissions reduction technologies and services through innovation. Achieving this goal will take systematic efforts, such as accelerating the evolution of China's energy mix toward greener energy, electrification of industrial facilities, and massive energy savings through changes in behaviors and new technologies.</p><p>BOZEC: China has pledged low-carbon development to establish a sound economic and technological mechanism for green development. This is significant for all of the humanity and a sustainable future.</p><p>Chinese consumers are raising expectations and demand for green consumption, as well as sustainable development. In line with the expectations, we aspire to balance true fashion authority with meaningful, positive changes. Our efforts include reducing emissions, water usage and waste; increasing traceability; boosting efforts on regenerative agriculture and environmentally preferred materials; and preserving and restoring biodiversity in the ecosystem.</p><p>Q5 What's your view on modernization in China that has spawned common prosperity? What does this pursuit mean for foreign businesses?</p><p>MUKUND: The continuous improvement of the lives of ordinary people in China means higher spiritual and material pursuits, which is an incremental source of market space for foreign companies with advanced technologies and services, while a harmonious social order further helps ensure a stable business environment.</p><p>WU: DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group share the same vision and commitment. Everything we do serves our corporate purpose: connecting people, improving lives. In recent decades, we have seen how increased trade and interaction have raised prosperity and choices, reduced poverty and cultivated diversity around the world. As a logistics provider, we are committed to bringing our purpose to life through global trade. Building those ties is our business and our mission. When more people have access to goods, services and information, the quality of their life improves.</p><p>BURRAGE: China has made remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, with the nation announcing the elimination of absolute poverty in 2021, which is an amazing feat. With the pursuit of common prosperity as the current goal, it will mean further positive changes in the lives of one-fifth of the global population living in China. It is based on China following a practical path that will see a great increase in the size of its middle-income population. This will naturally trigger greater demand in the market. That increased demand will undoubtedly lead to more opportunities for foreign businesses.</p><p>DEPOUX: Foreign businesses are and will remain important to the Chinese economy. According to the Hurun report, in 2021, the top 100 foreign companies in China generated $900 billion, accounting for 6 percent of China's GDP, and creating 2.5 million jobs domestically. The concept of common prosperity has become one of the most important guidelines and long-term goals leading China's development till 2050.Foreign businesses have to be more careful to seize opportunities in industries that are synergizing with the goal of common prosperity.</p><p>BOZEC: China is now heading into a new journey toward the realization of its second centenary goal, from high-quality economic and social development to people's wellbeing and the enhancement of people's sense of prosperity, happiness and security. Every step forward is encouraging foreign companies like Tapestry to strengthen our confidence and determination to deepen our roots in the Chinese market.</p><p>China's high-quality development in modernization is highly inclusive, bringing tangible benefits and providing incremental certainty and confidence to the market.

This has continued to 2022, even though it was disturbed by COVID-19 resurgences. The Chinese supply chain has modernized in 2021 thanks to accelerated investment in automation and digitalization, financed by the surge in demand. Yet, the situation going forward in 2023 is going to be different because the global economy is slowing down due to inflation, tightening monetary policies and the impact of high energy prices. International demand may weaken Chinese exports, but there is also a scenario by which energy shortages cause disruptions in industrial chains such as chemicals and commodities in Europe. China's production system may, again, be able to stabilize the global supply chain by picking up the demand that cannot be met in Europe.</p><p>BOZEC: We remain confident in China's economy, as China continues to be an important driving force for global development and prosperity. We have forged strong ties with our Chinese partners over our two decades in the market. We look forward to meeting and working with new partners as well as our existing network, and creating more value while contributing to China's economic growth.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q2 China has been deepening its reform and opening-up policy, particularly at the institutional level, so as to ensure equal treatment and an optimized business environment for foreign companies operating in China, and to persuade more of them to invest in China and benefit from the country's thrust on tech and innovation. How do you view China's efforts? How can China intensify such efforts, particularly in the context of any potential external or internal barriers?</p><p>MUKUND: The achievements of China's 40 years of reform and opening-up have attracted worldwide attention. And Benchmark ESG is honored to be a part of this legendary development. As a leading provider of cloud-based ESG software solutions, we have been firmly optimistic about the market prospects since entering China in 2009. Benchmark ESG's investment in China has been growing alongside the country's growing emphasis on safety in production and ongoing digital transformation. At the beginning of a new stage, we hope China will continue to pursue greater opening-up at a higher level, to give MNCs more opportunities for development and achieve win-win results.</p><p>WU: We have greatly benefited from the continuously improving business environment in China. As an international logistics provider, the efficiency of Customs clearance is critically important for us. In recent years, Chinese Customs has introduced a series of measures and digitalized approaches to streamline and accelerate the Customs clearance process, which significantly improves efficiency. Going forward, China's continuous opening-up will ultimately lead to an improved business environment, and we are confident that the focus on sustainable development of the Chinese economy will greatly benefit international trade. DHL Express will continue the solid partnership with Sinotrans and invest to keep our business in China growing.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays has benefited from China's opening-up from the perspective of equal market entrance. In the past decades, we have established offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Suzhou, providing our services to both multinational and domestic companies. The most recent China International Fair for Trade in Services, along with many other major trade events, such as the China International Import Expo, are very good examples of China's efforts to create opportunities. Its ongoing efforts to optimize the business environment and its drive for fair competition have been providing more convenience for the operations of foreign investors and companies. As China continues to provide more stability and certainty for businesses, it will attract more foreign investors with its huge market potential.</p><p>DEPOUX: China has been emphasizing fostering a new development paradigm through high-level opening-up, and foreign business will continue to play an important role in China's future economy. Senior decision-makers from headquarters overseas need to understand and engage more with the Chinese market, and entrust further investment into it. This will not go without human exchanges, with short business travel as well as expatriates, experts and decision-makers in the country.</p><p>BOZEC: The expansion of China's high-level opening-up and reform of the business environment further enhances the attractiveness and resilience of the Chinese economy, making the Chinese market one of the most dynamic and influential in the world. The optimized business environment has spurred the vitality of companies and brands like ours, while the increasingly open market has created an excellent business environment for investment and growth of foreign enterprises.</p><p>We strongly believe that the promotion of a series of favorable policies for enterprises has fueled great momentum in the market. This has provided us with more opportunities to participate in the market's development and enhance communication with partners.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q3 Innovation has been the bedrock of China's modernization. What new opportunities can you foresee for the world in China's pursuit of innovation-powered high-quality development?</p><p>MUKUND: In the past, China was often dubbed a big manufacturing power, but in recent years, we have seen more and more innovative icons in China: aerospace, artificial intelligence, new energy vehicles and more, and in many subsectors it has achieved curve overtaking and become a leader. It is not hard to imagine that China's existing huge manufacturing base, with policies and guidelines for innovation-driven high-quality development, will stimulate more vigorous modern market demands and foster broad employment opportunities while promoting the connectivity of a globalized economy, culture and technology, and create more possibilities for the sustainable development of human society.</p><p>WU: Technological innovation is a major driving force for cross-border e-commerce to achieve high-level development in the future. Currently, the emerging sector as a new form of foreign trade has huge development potential that not only stabilizes foreign trade amid global economic uncertainties, but also drives consumption growth and provides marketing opportunities, which further brings an increased demand for international logistics. With its worldwide network and breadth of industries served, DHL Express is able to accommodate fast-changing trade flows and facilitate the surge in cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>BURRAGE: China is now leading in many high-tech innovations, from information technology, the internet and artificial intelligence to smart manufacturing and biotech. With the innovation-driven development strategy, China is striving to become more independent in scientific research and R&amp;D of cutting-edge technology. The core of innovation is talent. At Hays, we have seen a substantial increase in talent in China's high-tech sectors. From the perspective of talent, sectors such as IT, AI, biotech, sustainability and smart manufacturing will continue to maintain enormous growth potential. Both employers and candidates will benefit from these opportunities.</p><p>DEPOUX: Looking forward, many opportunities are revolving around modernization and decarbonization in the Chinese economy. Since 2021, an increasing emphasis has been put on China's industrial modernization. The effort to peak and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 2060 is the key to maintaining competitiveness, and it will drive further acceleration of modernization. China has demonstrated its innovation capability and is leapfrogging and gaining leadership globally in areas such as the electric vehicle chain from batteries to charging infrastructure, solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines and nuclear and telecommunications equipment. We anticipate that in the near future, global competitiveness will be more and more driven by Chinese technological innovation.</p><p>BOZEC: China has bred many cutting-edge innovations, and its innovation capability in the digital economy is world-leading. Especially in the new retail environment, digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented speed across the industry, and online and offline integrated development has been dedicated to satisfying the public need for an enhanced experience and a better lifestyle.</p><p>For Tapestry, China is not only a vital market but also a source of inspiration for brands to seek innovation. We have built a strong local team for digital innovation, which we will continue to strengthen while working closely with local digital partners here.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q4 What's your take on China's dual carbon goals, which have received a thumbs-up globally? Do you see big business opportunities arising from the country's carbon goals?</p><p>MUKUND: China's carbon peaking and neutrality goals demonstrate the courage of a responsible country, and have brought about a series of gratifying changes in the past few years. Take Benchmark ESG's field as an example: potential investors and regulators have higher requirements for corporate ESG performance, corporate leadership and asset managers are moving faster toward ESG, while both upstream and downstream supply chains are actively seeking industry upgrades. Benchmark ESG is both a beneficiary of the dual carbon goals and a supporter of China to achieve it.</p><p>WU: In the logistics industry, DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group have been pioneering green transition with a total of 7 billion euros ($6.88 billion) investment by 2030, dedicated to using clean energy, deploying technologies and building climate-neutral facilities to reduce carbon emissions. In China, we have followed the same path and have achieved some noticeable results. We're committed to achieving 60 percent electrification of pickup and delivery vehicles by 2030. The current rate has been over 20 percent. We've also been striving to greet 30 percent green fuel-using long-haul trucks. The test of the first pilot hydrogen fuel cell truck was launched this month in Shanghai.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays recognizes and supports China's emissions goals. It is a difficult yet responsible action taken by the largest developing country to protect the planet and our future generations. The push to rapidly reduce carbon emissions is creating more business opportunities. On the one hand, peaking and net-zero goals are generating new sectors, for example, electric vehicles and the carbon trade mechanism. On the other hand, we see that the carbon emissions goals are creating more job opportunities in the market, and creating new types of jobs. At Hays, we are seeing companies across sectors either being proactive or required to establish sustainability departments.</p><p>DEPOUX: We believe that China's dual carbon goals are critical to the world, and innovation is key to meeting the objectives. It will push State-owned, private companies and multinationals to set more audacious objectives \u2014 not only abide by the zero-emissions target, but also claim leadership in emissions reduction technologies and services through innovation. Achieving this goal will take systematic efforts, such as accelerating the evolution of China's energy mix toward greener energy, electrification of industrial facilities, and massive energy savings through changes in behaviors and new technologies.</p><p>BOZEC: China has pledged low-carbon development to establish a sound economic and technological mechanism for green development. This is significant for all of the humanity and a sustainable future.</p><p>Chinese consumers are raising expectations and demand for green consumption, as well as sustainable development. In line with the expectations, we aspire to balance true fashion authority with meaningful, positive changes. Our efforts include reducing emissions, water usage and waste; increasing traceability; boosting efforts on regenerative agriculture and environmentally preferred materials; and preserving and restoring biodiversity in the ecosystem.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q5 What's your view on modernization in China that has spawned common prosperity? What does this pursuit mean for foreign businesses?</p><p>MUKUND: The continuous improvement of the lives of ordinary people in China means higher spiritual and material pursuits, which is an incremental source of market space for foreign companies with advanced technologies and services, while a harmonious social order further helps ensure a stable business environment.</p><p>WU: DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group share the same vision and commitment. Everything we do serves our corporate purpose: connecting people, improving lives. In recent decades, we have seen how increased trade and interaction have raised prosperity and choices, reduced poverty and cultivated diversity around the world. As a logistics provider, we are committed to bringing our purpose to life through global trade. Building those ties is our business and our mission. When more people have access to goods, services and information, the quality of their life improves.</p><p>BURRAGE: China has made remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, with the nation announcing the elimination of absolute poverty in 2021, which is an amazing feat. With the pursuit of common prosperity as the current goal, it will mean further positive changes in the lives of one-fifth of the global population living in China. It is based on China following a practical path that will see a great increase in the size of its middle-income population. This will naturally trigger greater demand in the market. That increased demand will undoubtedly lead to more opportunities for foreign businesses.</p><p>DEPOUX: Foreign businesses are and will remain important to the Chinese economy. According to the Hurun report, in 2021, the top 100 foreign companies in China generated $900 billion, accounting for 6 percent of China's GDP, and creating 2.5 million jobs domestically. The concept of common prosperity has become one of the most important guidelines and long-term goals leading China's development till 2050.Foreign businesses have to be more careful to seize opportunities in industries that are synergizing with the goal of common prosperity.</p><p>BOZEC: China is now heading into a new journey toward the realization of its second centenary goal, from high-quality economic and social development to people's wellbeing and the enhancement of people's sense of prosperity, happiness and security. Every step forward is encouraging foreign companies like Tapestry to strengthen our confidence and determination to deepen our roots in the Chinese market.</p><p>China's high-quality development in modernization is highly inclusive, bringing tangible benefits and providing incremental certainty and confidence to the market. The new development pattern encourages us to keep upholding the concept of innovation, enhance the localization potential of our brands, and create more value for Chinese consumers.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e64.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R Mukund</emphasis></p><p>founder and CEO of Benchmark Digital</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e66.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wu Dongming</emphasis></p><p>CEO of DHL Express China</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e68.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Burrage</emphasis></p><p>managing director of Hays Asia</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e6a.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Depoux</emphasis></p><p>managing director of Roland Berger</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e6c.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yann Bozec</emphasis></p><p>president of Tapestry Asia-Pacific, president and CEO of Coach China</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "China Daily European Edition", "instances": ["Chinese consumers are raising expectations and demand for green consumption, as well as sustainable development.

Fashion today thrives on speed, but Bode's \"slow fashion\" approach is the antithesis of this, and features nostalgic yet modern garments created using antique textiles and historical crafting techniques. </p><p>Her Woolmark collection, for example, comprises six looks made using dead stock fabric sourced from mills and sustainable merino wool, which she pieced together using handwork techniques including quilting, mending and appliqu\u00e9. Overcoats and suits are crafted from reclaimed and remade equestrian show blankets, while merino felt jumpers are pieced together like patchwork. </p><p>\"Bode's practice goes back to regenerative agriculture, linking textile production with a complicated but lively ecosystem ... Her excellent skill of story telling meticulously and vividly documents all materials and processes, down to the details of each weaver and dyer's name,\" said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3040013/sustainable-fashion-how-chinese-brands-are-going-green\">Shaway Yeh</url>, one of the prize's judges and founder of fashion sustainability consultancy YehYehYeh. </p><p>Bode grew up in America's Deep South, but it was on her trips to New England, where her parents are from, that she fell in love with antiques and vintage fashion. She did a dual degree in philosophy and fashion at Parsons School of Design in New York. </p><p>\"So much of it had to do with history. I am really inspired by personal histories, narratives and everything that goes along with collecting,\" Bode says. </p><p>Her choice of menswear, she says, was serendipitous. At the time there was investment in men's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/luxury/article/3065010/paris-fashion-week-coronavirus-kept-fashion-editors-away\">Fashion Week in New York</url> and she always had an interest in men's clothing. </p><p>\u00a0 </p><p>The real story for Bode, however, is in the materials she sources, which include repurposed antique textiles - such as domestic textiles and family heirlooms she finds at estate sales - and dead stock from defunct mills. Everything is manufactured in her atelier in New York, by a team of two who do everything, from cutting to sewing. This has meant that her business has been sustainable from day one, even though she rarely promotes or markets it as such. </p><p>\"Our pieces have something intangible within them that creates an emotive response with the wearer. For example, we work with a historical mill in Pennsylvania, reproducing American patterns from the 1800s, so when people wear them, they can connect back to their own history and understand their culture. </p><p>\"At the same time, the shapes are recognisable and classic. It's important that they don't look like they've been taken from a specific era so they can stand the test of time,\" she says. </p><p>Although she uses American and French textiles, Bode has recently started to explore India, where she sources textiles and embroideries. It was there that she discovered handwoven fabrics like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/2159659/indian-fashion-labels-use-homespun-cloth-mahatma-gandhi\">khadi</url>, which was popularised and worn by Mahatma Gandhi during his fight for Indian independence. </p><p>\"Almost half of our business is made in India and it's a culture I am connected to through my fianc\u00e9, who is Indian. We use fabrics that have a beautiful political narrative, like khadi which is made on hand looms, so it is also self-sufficient and has zero carbon footprint. The culture may not be my own, but there is still a story to tell which I love,\" she says. </p><p>Four years later and her story is even more global. In January she moved to men's fashion week in Paris to be closer to her buyers (she says half of her business is in Europe), and now has a growing list of international stockists that include Joyce in Hong Kong and, as of this season, Chinese retailers such as Dover Street Beijing, Labelhood and Juice. </p><p>She recently opened her first store in New York, in Soho's Hester Street, which also offers other categories such as home textiles and children's wear. Opening a larger network of stores is also on her list as the industry undergoes a revamp and the wholesale market continues to struggle in the US and Europe. </p><p>\"Initially most of our customers were around 30 to 40 years old, but now we're seeing a younger clientele walking in. These are guys who are interested in cultures that have shaped their life and family histories and enjoy shopping either vintage or pieces they know are not based on trend. </p><p>\"We also do a lot of bespoke from the store - especially weddings - and this is one aspect I'm in interested in growing in near future,\" she says. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2020.

There, he's embraced permaculture, as in \"permanent agriculture\", trying to provide a framework for living in harmony with nature that gives back more than is consumed. Permaculture is a movement developed in the 1970s as a solution to an increasingly overburdened food system. </p><p>\"Globally, we're trying to squeeze infinite growth out of a finite system of resources - and if people don't wake up and change their consumption habits, then we're headed for a pretty serious system collapse,\" the 27-year-old says. </p><p>A colleague, Janaki Chengalath, pointed Teague to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/1007431/how-green-their-valley\">Ark Eden</url>, an organic permaculture farm that runs nature-based programmes, on nearby Lantau Island. Teague spent the first quarter of 2020 in South India, and took a permaculture design course on his return to develop Bridge. Chengalath and Teague's sister, Rebecca, have joined him in his movement. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus pandemic</url> has shown the fragility of food systems, and Teague believes that Hong Kong must look into building a community and sourcing food locally if it wants to become more resilient. What really struck him was the use of unregulated chemicals in conventional agriculture, and how they seep not just into our food but the environment, too. </p><p>\"This is contributing to many of the chronic illnesses we are seeing today. We moved to Lamma, began growing our own food, discovered a community and are on a journey to live more in tandem with nature. Bridge is a platform we are using to share this journey with whomever feels a similar calling - to reconnect with nature and learn how they can heal themselves, and in turn, the planet.\" </p><p>The team runs workshops on topics such as composting to end food waste and produce high-quality soil, designing garden beds for a home space such as a balcony to grow your own produce, and on maintaining gut health. Bridge also offers a consulting service to people who want to design their lives or spaces to be more in line with or mimic natural, regenerative systems. </p><p>\"Our lives are basically an ongoing discussion of ideas that are developing and changing every day - sort of like an ecosystem.

Under-regulated chemicals used in the agricultural industry, such as the herbicide glyphosate, or preservatives in our food, have been building up in our guts over decades, and have led to the killing of many of the beneficial microbes that our gut needs to defend against pathogens. </p><p>\"This creates what we call 'leaky gut', in which our gut effectively acts like a sieve where all the unwanted, nasty stuff is allowed to enter into the more sensitive parts of the digestive system - which can lead to chronic inflammation.\" </p><p>Those who knew Teague before Bridge might not recognise this New Age sage.

The task force is a private sector initiative started by Mark Carney, the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. </p><p>Bill Kentrup, co-founder of Hong Kong start-up Allinfra, which provides digital tools that make carbon finance more efficient, expects some carbon trading platforms \"with global significance\" and carbon investment products to be launched in the city in the next three to six months. </p><p>\"There is quite a bit of activity going on,\" he said. </p><p>Hong Kong is not new to carbon trading, Kentrup noted. He co-founded Noble Carbon Credits - one of the earliest Asia-based carbon trading platforms, almost two decades ago, and led Macquarie Capital's Asia carbon credit and renewable energy financing business from Hong Kong. </p><p>\"Noble financed CDM projects in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa, and managed some of the largest carbon trading books globally ... so Hong Kong does have a history in being a leader in this space,\" he said. </p><p>The so-called Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was a carbon credits trading scheme under the United Nations-led Kyoto Protocol for climate actions. </p><p>There are two broad kinds of carbon trading regimes. Some are established by governments to enforce mandatory emission reductions, while others are voluntary schemes driven by the private sector and non-government organisations (NGOs). Both use market forces to tackle <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>. </p><p>Private-sector schemes mainly target companies and institutions seeking to meet their decarbonisation goals through \"carbon offsets\" by buying credits from project owners to make up for the shortfalls in their own carbon footprint reductions. </p><p>Different types of carbon credit markets have existed since 2005 when the Kyoto Protocol took effect, resulting in the establishment of the first international carbon trading system in the European Union. </p><p>Before expiring in 2020, the Kyoto treaty bound dozens of nations - mainly in Europe - to carbon cut targets which could be met by buying credits generated by verified greenhouse gases reduction projects in lower-cost developing nations. </p><p>Since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/paris-climate-summit-2015\">2015 Paris agreement</url> was adopted, over 190 countries have negotiated to create a new regime for internationally tradeable carbon credits, each representing verified reduction or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of other greenhouse gases. </p><p>A deal was reached last weekend at the United Nations Climate Change summit (COP26) in Glasgow, allowing countries to use offset credits from other nations to partially meet their climate goals. The mutual recognition of globally tradeable credits was a breakthrough as it led to more active and larger transactions among many more nations, compared to the CDM. In a compromise that further sweetened the COP26 deal, old credits from the CDM since 2013 - involving 320 million tonnes of reductions - will be carried over to the new regime. </p><p>To avoid double counting and deter abuses, countries that generate carbon credits can decide whether to export them to other nations, or to count them towards their own targets. </p><p>That closes the loophole in the CDM system that was the source of much criticism, where Asian manufacturers were called out for setting up facilities to eliminate fluoroform - a refrigerant and greenhouse gas that was more potent than carbon dioxide - after producing them in excess in the first place. After the double-dipping was exposed by environmental advocates, the UN tightened the credit rules for this category, and the EU banned their sale from 2013. </p><p>The demand for carbon credits is projected to skyrocket in the coming decades, as thousands of companies announced ambitious targets to shrink their carbon footprints to align with global climate efforts. </p><p>Almost one in five of the world's 2,000 biggest listed companies - with US$14 trillion in combined annual sales - have made some form of commitment to net zero carbon emission, <url normalizedValue=\"https://eciu.net/media/press-releases/2021/report-fifth-of-worlds-largest-companies-now-have-net-zero-target\">according to a March report</url> by researchers of The Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit and Oxford University. </p><p>Around 30 per cent are aiming to reach net zero by 2030, while just over half of them aspire to do so in 2041 or later. Around 40 per cent have indicated they will need some carbon offsets to reach the goals, while only 8 per cent ruled out using them. The rest have not specified their intentions. </p><p>Cutting 23 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions - more than double China's entire footprint last year - by 2030 is needed to meet the 2015 Paris global climate agreement, which aimed to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. </p><p>Some 2 billion tonnes will have to come from projects that remove it from the atmosphere, according to a report published in January by Carney's task force. </p><p>This would require a 15-fold jump in voluntary offset volume by 2030 from 2019 levels if all of the removal projects are financed by carbon credits, the task force projected, creating a market worth up to US$50 billion. The market could quadruple to US$200 billion by 2050, according to a forecast by the German bank Berenberg. </p><p>Voluntary credit trades are currently mostly done through bilateral negotiations. Project details and certified credits are lodged at registries run by crediting programmes such as Washington-based Verra and Switzerland-based Gold Standard. </p><p>Some trading is done via platforms such as Singapore's AirCarbon Exchange launched in 2019. It deploys <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/blockchain\">blockchain technology</url> to increase trust, through immutable files of electronically stored data. Nascent Climate Impact X completed a pilot auction of carbon credits backed by a portfolio of forestry projects on November 1. The carbon exchange set up by DBS Bank, Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/standard-chartered-bank\">Standard Chartered Bank</url> and the city state's sovereign fund manager Temasek will host regular auctions from early 2022. </p><p>Further afield, the London Stock Exchange announced on November 5 that it is developing a capital markets solution to facilitate the public listing of carbon funds. </p><p>Trading of voluntary credits had grown in leaps and bounds, with 2020s transactions volume surging 80 per cent from a year earlier to 189 million tonnes. Since 2005, a total of US$1.74 billion of trades have been recorded. In the first eight months of this year, 293 million tonnes of voluntary credits were traded by 172 companies, at an average price of US$3.1 per tonne, according to Ecosystem Marketplace. </p><p>Prices are low due to a surplus of unused carbon offset credits, McNeil said. \"A two-tier system of low-cost, low-quality and high-cost, high-quality offsets is the most likely outcome in the absence of a global agreement on international emissions trading,\" he said. </p><p>Prices should rise to US$20 to US$30 a tonne by 2030 for the world's emissions reduction efforts to be credible, according to a report by Trove Research and University College London. </p><p>\"We are only at the beginning of the [growth] journey,\" said Matthew Townsend, a London-based partner at international law firm Allen &amp; Overy. \"There is a significant way to go to inject sufficient price transparency into the market and other aspects of governance.\" </p><p>\"We need a single set of rules which determine what projects will be eligible, and provide sufficient legal certainty and veracity to the credits,\" Townsend said. \"There is much more work to do to set up the framework for voluntary markets to function properly, whether on sectoral or regional basis.\" </p><p>A major milestone in the global regulation of sustainable finance was crossed on November 3, when various international standards setters agreed to consolidate and unify their rules. A prototype of disclosure requirements was published. </p><p>Ashley Alder, the chief executive of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also chairs the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), and he expected the prototype standards to be endorsed by the end of this year. </p><p>He hoped Hong Kong's regulators will be able to finish incorporating them into companies' audit and listing rules by the end of next year or early 2023. </p><p>This would help build a strong foundation for growing green finance - including carbon credits-backed investment products - in Hong Kong, whose ambition to become a sustainable finance hub is \"seriously realistic,\" he said on November 5. </p><p>Still, investors need to be aware of transparency, liquidity and the technology risks of projects on which credits are earned and traded, as they often involve complicated measurement and governance issues. </p><p>In forestry, one of the more prominent industries where voluntary carbon credits have been traded, ascertaining that sellers have sound legal rights and land titles are part of the due diligence process that is key to ensuring the credits generated are worth what they were traded for, said Allen Overy's partner Scott Neilson in Tokyo. </p><p>\"It gets quite granular and complicated ... some trees grow faster and sequester more carbon dioxide, while regenerative agriculture practices that enhance crops' resilience to climate change give rise to different levels of carbon dioxide absorption and releases,\" he said. </p><p>The voluntary market is expected to see significant growth in the next 18 months with the launch of multiple sector-focused schemes, Townsend said. </p><p>\"The next two years will be critical,\" he said. \"Realistically it will take two to five years for the markets to settle down with robust transparency and rule books.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2021.

This means the development of economies that are predominantly run on renewable energy, regenerative agriculture, and income from jobs with a low carbon footprint. </p><p>However, this approach conflicts with the NZE2050 \"solution\", which relies on a mixture of market-based mechanisms and technology quick-fixes. NZE2050 assumes that these methods, which have been developed for richer nations, will work for the global majority, too, both technically and politically. </p><p>Thus, the main components of NZE2050 concern conversions from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the use of carbon capture and sequestration, and carbon offsetting. </p><p>While these methods appear legitimate and appealing, they will not work for the world at large. These methods may work in part for a country or a region, but they cannot be part of a global solution. </p><p>NZE2050 advocates are in denial of the causes of human activity that lead to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>, which betrays a poor understanding of the economics of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/climate-change\">climate change</url> and the socioeconomic realities for the global majority. </p><p>Why? Because reaching NZE2050 with these methods is simply not possible for either rich countries (the global minority) or poor countries (the global majority) within the 30-year time frame needed. It would be far more effective to pool global funds to build renewable energy systems in global majority countries. </p><p>For global minority countries, no amount of offsetting or activation of renewables can overcome the intensely consumptive nature of their lifestyles and economies, or fix the nature of their political systems, which are arrested to inaction by their own partisan democratic values. Thus slogans replace the hard work of changing societies. </p><p>NZE2050 is also impossible for global majority countries because they need requisite energy to build their nations and to provide basic needs for their large populations. This cannot be circumvented by the technology-based methods inherent in NZE2050 - if global minority countries cannot implement CO2-reducing tech on a large scale, how could global majority countries? </p><p>The politicians in global minority countries know this. What is surprising is that the global scientific community has gone along with this fictitious approach too, presumably through a desire to offer solutions. </p><p>There are three main reasons for the NZE2050 myth. </p><p>First, it legitimises economic approaches to climate change that preserve the status quo of mass consumption, particularly in global minority countries. Why give up the privileges that come with being the richest nations in the world when it is possible to use market- and tech-based solutions to disguise business-as-usual activity and pass the buck? </p><p>Second, the market- and techno-centric approach of NZE2050 provides an easy alternative to addressing the flaws of political systems in global minority countries, which enable massive CO2 release. </p><p>The sacrosanct nature of individual freedoms must not be touched even while the world heads towards collapse. As a result, there is no real political will to change, because it would challenge this pillar of liberal societies. The inability to accept that individual lifestyles must change drives deceptive concepts such as NZE2050. </p><p>Lastly, NZE2050 is supported because being seen to back CO2 neutral initiatives frames leaders of minority countries as climate champions, granting them legitimacy in a world where the public is increasingly motivated by climate-positive action. </p><p>The assumption underlying markets is that profit-driven companies will with the right policy incentives somehow generate effective solutions to climate change with guidance from the \"invisible hand\". </p><p>Historically, unregulated business activity does not take into account environmental externalities and consequently is one of the key contributions to the world's present problems. </p><p>As a result, even if the free market encourages business activity to become more sustainable, it does not address root problems. Corporations do not do sustainability, they do \"more\" of things. </p><p>More renewable energy sources or more energy efficient vehicles do not equate to a global culture of decreasing consumption. Instead, markets disguise the failure to achieve actual reductions in externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions or energy consumption through carbon offsetting - by planting trees, for example. </p><p>The carbon offsetting market is an example of a market-based approach that is constructed around pseudoscience but is accepted to preserve \"business as usual\". </p><p>There is no economic equivalence between emitted CO2 and offset CO2. It is not possible to equate absorption of atmospheric CO2 by trees with the CO2 emitted from burning fossil fuels. Trees are part of the active carbon cycle, while fossil fuel reserves are inert. Trees take decades to absorb carbon, while fossil fuel use releases it instantly. There are not enough trees in the world to offset society's carbon, and nor will there ever be. </p><p>The second case of the NZE2050 fallacy is the obsession with silver-bullet technology. This is the belief that technology will save the day by minimising carbon emissions or better yet, draw them down and reverse the damage. </p><p>In effect, this enables minority countries to continue enjoying their CO2-heavy lifestyles. The truth is, many of these technologies do not even exist yet, and if they do exist, their uptake and impact has been unimpressive. </p><p>Take carbon capture and storage (CCS). The world's largest direct air capture plant came online in September, and it can collect about 4,000 tonnes of CO2 a year -about as much CO2 as is emitted globally every four seconds. </p><p>Although CCS and similar technologies can be used to reduce rich-world missions during their transitions, they are far too expensive for the global majority and cannot be replicated around the world at sufficient scale and speed to make a difference in the time frames needed. </p><p>Yet the lack of tangible tech solutions has not stopped the ever-rising push for large-scale hare-brained tech solutions, like geoengineering, despite their potential for unknown and damaging consequences. </p><p>The US National Academies of Sciences, for example, has recommended allocating up to US$200 million over the next five years to explore how light-reflecting particles could be injected into the upper atmosphere to prevent further global warming. The consequences of this are of course completely unknown. That this has received funding shows how desperate the need is to preserve the political status quo and consumption-driven lifestyles. </p><p>Even more commonplace tech, such as efficiency-improving mechanisms, can have economic complications. Here's why: tech that increases energy efficiency will result in a lower CO2 output per unit of energy. </p><p>This is good - there is a need to prepare for a low emissions future through accelerating energy efficiency. But the increased efficiency will also result in a price drop per outcome with the same unit of energy. With a price drop comes increased overall consumption as market forces kick-in, because energy is readily available and cheap. </p><p>This is a paradox: the ability to use an energy resource more efficiently makes it both cheaper and more valuable at the same time, increasing its overall use and deepening our reliance on it. </p><p>The perpetuation of the silver-bullet tech mythos helps to abdicate responsibility of climate change onto future generations because it is much easier for minority countries to hope for a panacea that preserves the status quo than resorting to state intervention in the free market or in curtailing individual freedoms. </p><p>Meanwhile, the realities of the challenges faced by developing nations means solutions devised in minority countries may not be appropriate. </p><p>Take the obsession with tech-based climate solutions. Are these replicable in rural regions? Is the tech culturally appropriate? Is it affordable? Is it even for sale? </p><p>It has been estimated that solutions like biofuels and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would demand between 0.4 and 1.2 billion hectares of land, which equates to 25 per cent to 80 per cent of all the land currently under cultivation. </p><p>This is simply not possible when global demand for food in 2050 will be between 30 per cent to 50 per cent higher than at present - mostly from large developing countries like Nigeria, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/indonesia\">Indonesia</url> and India. The reality is that the governments of these countries will need to focus on feeding their people, not drawing down carbon. </p><p>Unfortunately, it is these countries that will be most affected by climate change. </p><p>The market-based approach of carbon offsetting is also blind to the needs of the global majority. Offsetting allows large companies in global minority countries to buy their way out of reducing emissions by investing in \"climate-friendly\" projects. Often these take place in the developing world, like planting trees in South Africa. </p><p>Plantations like these obviously present a host of land-rights and social justice issues. But it's also the premise of the model: that resources in global majority countries can be used to maintain the levels of privilege enjoyed by global minority countries. </p><p>The entire concept is built on inequity, and it speaks to the fundamental flaw of NZE2050: at best, it ignores the needs of the global majority; at worst it is carbon colonialism. </p><p>For example, China is often painted as the world's carbon enemy, as its largest CO2 emitter. Yet energy consumption (and therefore CO2 emission) is needed for economic development - and China has the world's largest population, so it is natural to assume it would produce the most CO2 in its efforts to lift 800 million people out of poverty. </p><p>Is the expectation that global majority countries should forgo development like this to keep emissions low? If so, this implies that blame for the climate crisis is homogenous across the world - but it most certainly is not. Attempts to assert the contrary instead show the eco-imperialism latent in NZE2050. </p><p>The global minority has released the vast majority of emissions as it progressed over the last 200 years and continues to emit many times more than the global majority. </p><p>The US has emitted far more CO2 than any other country: it accounts for a quarter of all emissions since 1751. Despite China's huge rise in emissions over the past decade, emissions per person still sit at less than half those of the US. Meanwhile the 1 billion people living in Sub-Saharan Africa each emit one-twentieth of the average person in the US. </p><p>The flaws of NZE2050 manifest as a smokescreen for business-as-usual economic practices and even act as a form of environmental imperialism, allowing the global minority to shunt their carbon debt to future generations and the global majority. </p><p>When this is recognised, it will be much more straightforward for politicians and leaders to espouse that the global minority needs to reduce their fossil fuel use and change their lifestyles. </p><p>This means growth in the rich world's footprint must stop. Developed countries must scale back their resource consumption and pollution output and give room for the rest of the world to grow to meet basic needs. </p><p>As many developing nations have pointed out - the world is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> united by NZE2050. There is very clearly an \"us\" and a \"them\". There can be no \"we\" when one party bears so much more responsibility for the climate challenges we face. </p><p>But it is all right to admit to us and them. This is a more useful narrative than NZE2050 because it will help motivate the right kind of change. </p><p>The truth is that each nation and region will have different trajectories to take in the coming decades: the developed world will struggle to placate its populations when the need for reduced resource use and lowered emissions comes to bear, while the developing world will continue to struggle to provide security and meet the basic needs for its populations as climate change worsens. </p><p>This will be the only course of action. The 20th century was for mitigation, and we failed - in the 21st century, we have no choice left but to pursue adaptation though decreased resource use and greenhouse gas emissions in the rich world. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chandran Nair is founder and CEO of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, an Executive Committee Member of the Club of Rome, and author of 'Dismantling Global White Privilege: Equity for a Post-Western World'.</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2021.

[Photo/CHINA DAILY]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was introduced to the concepts of agribusiness and agro-industrial chains and systems exactly 30 years ago when I was studying to become an agronomist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. Although these concepts appeared in the United States in 1957 and 1968, respectively, through the works of John Davis and Ray Goldberg, they only reached Brazil in 1990 when Ney Bittencourt de Ara\u00fajo and Decio Zylbersztajn disseminated this analytical form in the private sector and academia, respectively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This dissemination has taken shape over the last three decades and today it is the prevailing way of thinking, namely that agriculture is a complex activity carried out by producers who need to be closely integrated downstream with suppliers of agricultural inputs and upstream with industry, distributors, retailers and service providers. These integrated chains are the forums for the elaboration of private strategies and public policies aimed at their development.</p><p>The growth of integrated thinking in food production chains has gone hand in hand with the strong growth of the agribusiness and food production in Brazil, whose exports in these 30 years have jumped from around $5-10 billion per year to $100.81 billion in 2020. This was the second-largest amount of exports, second only to 2018, and represented a growth rate of 4.1 percent compared to 2019. This sector contributed 48 percent of Brazil's total outward trade. Consolidated imports, on the other hand, amounted to $13.05 billion (down 5.2 percent), leaving the agribusiness balance of trade with a surplus of $87.76 billion, which made up for the deficit of other sectors in the region of $36.87 billion.</p><p>Consolidated data from the Ministry of Economy reveal that in the last 10 years, Brazilian agribusiness has accounted for about $1 trillion worth of exports, bringing in a surplus of $800 billion to the national balance of trade. In other words, food exports clearly guarantee income generation into Brazil.</p><p>The gross production value in that decade reached around $1.44 trillion, up 95 percent, in real value, than the previous decade. The GPV for 2020 reached about $170.3 billion, the highest amount and 17 percent higher than 2019, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply. The ministry projects that the GPV for 2021 will reach $195 billion, a growth of 10.1 percent compared to 2020.</p><p>Such food production, which today helps feed almost 1 billion people around the world, represents a great success of income generation, bringing development and opportunities to the Brazilian hinterland. Data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture show how these resources helped build up important social indicators. Currently, 94.4 percent of 5-year-olds attend school and 98.2 percent have access to drinking water. There are almost 15 million jobs in the agricultural sector alone and a large number of learning centers and technical schools preparing for work in agriculture.</p><p>The resources generated by agriculture and food production has led to the creation of thriving cities with the growth of trade, services and industry, thus generating jobs and bringing development inwards. This interesting process reduced the rural exodus towards the periphery of large urban centers, with the subsequent creation of shanty towns, and has brought about a better life in these smaller towns, with more social, cultural and leisure alternatives. Young people are no longer leaving, but rather building new lives in these \"agro-cities\".</p><p>There are many instances of such agro-cities in Brazil, but I would like to highlight one of them, since we have carried out sustainability studies there. The city is Quirin\u00f3polis in the state of Goi\u00e1s. Data from the past 10-year period show strong agricultural development and product industrialization. Between the year 2000 and 2010, the population grew from 35,000 to 45,000; jobs rose from 4,000 to 10,000; the average wage grew almost 4 times; per capita income from $1,160.00 to $2,170.00; tax revenues for the state and number of vehicles multiplied per 3; among others. But one of the most interesting indicators is the number of companies, which went from 650 to 3,100, revealing an enormous creation of opportunities for people in various sectors of the economy.</p><p>Another interesting trend, observed particularly over the past 10 years, is the fact that agriculture, because of its upward strength, has become rather fashionable among young Brazilians, who continue to innovate and develop start-ups for the sector. Many youths who had gone to bigger cities to study are now returning to help their families with the modern management tools that are available to the sector, such as aerial monitoring, remote sensing, big data, and the localized application of products that allow for the management of productive areas no longer per hectare, but per square meter, resulting in greater efficiency and reduction of waste.</p><p>The benefits that food and agribusiness has brought to Brazil in the last 30 years are well known, reaching 50 percent of the country's exports and generating about one-third of GDP, one-third of jobs and almost one-third of tax revenue, depending on which sectors were included in the definition of agribusiness.</p><p>If the prevailing mentality at the beginning of these 30 years was to promote development, it is remarkable how, toward the end of this period, the concept of sustainability has become paramount. Its evolution is also notorious, since at first it was associated with the environmental issue only, but with the arrival of the Triple Bottom Line model or PPP (people, planet and profit), there was a recognition of the importance of interaction and cooperation between different agents in these three dimensions. In line with this thinking, the UN set up the 2030 Agenda in 2015 as a plan of action for a more sustainable future. It consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which call for bold transformative measures in order to achieve them, and agriculture has much to contribute in seeking to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure peace and prosperity for the people.</p><p>More recently, the concept of ESG has emerged, a new set of environmental, social and governance scores, which give investment professionals, analysts and corporations an insight into company performance on these matters. We consider ESG to be an evolution of the 3P, two of them being virtually identical: the P in planet and environment, the P in people and the S in social. The evolution in terms of sophistication lies in the P in profit, which has evolved into a broader concept of G for governance, implying much more structural actions. Profit is indeed a result of good governance.</p><p>ESG reports have reached fever pitch in the food and agribusiness sector, and companies now disclose their activities with transparency within these criteria for the benefit of good governance, the environment and wider society, thus paving the way for possible investments. Such information helps mitigate risks, focusing on long-term results. The Brazilian Stock Exchange has issued the Carbon Efficient Index portfolio with funding in this direction. The results achieved in initial public offerings by companies in this sector are impressive, attracting many international investors within sophisticated ESG indicators. This creates a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.</p><p>In the environmental field, payment for environmental services is the law in Brazil, promoting sustainable development by means of remuneration for the asset being preserved. This payment can be made in different ways, such as payments in money, provision of services, compensation or through bonds. The so-called green bonds could earn Brazilian agriculture $135.9 billion in funding by 2030, according to a projection made by the Climate Bonds Initiative, a British NGO which certifies organizations to issue these bonds.</p><p>The signals on the part of the public sector, together with this private push towards sustainability, in these times of great transparency and engagement provided for by social media, further strengthen Brazil in its search for the role of sustainable global supplier of food, bioenergy (ethanol, biodiesel and bioelectricity) and other agricultural products (cotton, tobacco, timber and furniture, leather, paper and pulp, among others). Despite the ongoing rise of illegal deforestation in the Amazon, which is being combated and has a feasible solution, Brazil shows excellent indicators in the environmental area, often not recognized by the international community, namely:</p><p>a) being one of the countries with the largest number of protected areas, covered with natural vegetation (estimated at 66 percent of the country's total area) and with one of the strictest forest codes on the planet;</p><p>b) being one of the countries with the lowest CO2 emissions per capita on the planet;</p><p>c) being one of the countries with the highest uptake of renewable energy in its energy matrix (estimated at 47 percent of the total, against 10 percent in OECD countries);</p><p>d) being the country with the highest proportion of biofuel use in its fuel matrix (close to 50 percent for automobiles and 15 percent for lorries and buses) and with one of the most modern decarbonization programs in place (Renovabio);</p><p>e) having an agriculture with one of the highest levels of innovation in terms of resource-saving technologies, such as bio-inputs (bio-pesticides, bio-fertilizers and biogas, among others), crop-livestock-forest integration, per-square-meter management of agricultural activities, regenerative agriculture, circular agriculture and resource-sharing agriculture, with great development of collective activity via cooperatives and associations.</p><p>The sustainability challenge facing Brazil for the next 30 years is huge, but feasible with the arrival of international investments. In order to keep the growth of supply in balance with the world's growth of demand, Brazil will need to use, by 2030, an area about 15 to 20 million hectares larger than currently used (80 million hectares) for the production of grains and other crops (except livestock). The good news is that, as livestock production becomes more technically advanced and capable of producing more in a smaller area, these 20 million extra hectares can be captured from the 160 million hectares currently used for pasture. Even then, Brazil will be using less than 15 percent of its territory, just over 850 million hectares, for agriculture.</p><p>Incorporating those ESG principles into an already consolidated way of thinking about production chains was just the spur that was needed in the promotion of sustainable development. The challenge for Brazil is to keep moving forward at a fast pace and sustainably in the efficiency of its agribusiness in order to help supply the growing world population with increasingly urban habits and, with this productivity and efficiency, allow for greater control of the prices of the world's main food commodities with the consequent reduction in world hunger.</p><p>In conclusion, society's creativity will stand for the S in ESG. Where the growth of agribusiness and food production comes hand in hand with the generation of more inclusion, the creation of opportunities for people and social development, that is where new solutions will emerge, in our increasingly digital, home-office based, automated world. In the next three decades the main challenge will be putting people first.</p><p>Marcos Fava Neves is a professor of business at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) and Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV) in Brazil.<br/><br/>The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.</p><p>If you have a specific expertise and would like to contribute to China Daily, please contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:opinion@chinadaily.com.cn\">opinion@chinadaily.com.cn</email> , and <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comment@chinadaily.com.cn\">comment@chinadaily.com.cn</email></p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["9 billion in funding by 2030, according to a projection made by the Climate Bonds Initiative, a British NGO which certifies organizations to issue these bonds.

Materials such as linen and cotton come from the land, so how they are grown has a significant impact on the environment. </p><p>According to the non-profit Regeneration International, regenerative agriculture refers to \"farming and grazing practices that ... reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity\". </p><p>Bombyx is among a growing number of fashion brands that have embraced regenerative agriculture to help mitigate the damage wrought by the fashion industry. </p><p>Another such company is the sportswear retailer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/2186798/north-face-and-patagonia-big-winners-new-urban-hiker-trend\">Patagonia</url>. According to Roger Zeng, founder of brand distributor Cora, which represents companies including Patagonia, regenerative agriculture is a theme adopted by the brand this year. </p><p>One of the initiatives pushed by Patagonia - which stopped using industrial cotton 25 years ago - is clothing made from hemp, which requires much less space and water to produce than similar crops. The company sources all its hemp from China, though it is now pushing for its cultivation in the US. </p><p>\"After 80 years of criminalisation in the US, hemp cultivation was made legal last year in America following the passing of the 2018 farm bill,\" Zeng says. </p><p>\"Hemp production is a kind of regenerative agriculture. Hemp is very durable. People can wear clothes made from it for years. Hemp fabric is also good for ventilation, making it a good choice for summer. Growing it is good for soil as it needs little in the way of pesticides. Given these properties, Patagonia has been pushing it since its cultivation was decriminalised in the US.\" </p><p>Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario said at the National Retail Federation conference in New York in January that agriculture represents the best chance humans have of lessening the climate crisis. </p><p>\"The science is saying that if we converted all industrialised agriculture to regenerative organic practices, we could sequester all the world's carbon,\" she said. </p><p>Zeng says that as part of Patagonia's push for regenerative agriculture, the company has a material science research department that is studying how to expand the use of hemp fabric beyond summer wear, for which it is currently mostly suited. In fact, earlier this year, Patagonia sent a film crew to hemp-producing regions in China to record its production to raise public awareness. </p><p>Clients, especially younger ones, want to buy brands with social values that align with theirs </p><p>Hilmond Hui, founder and president, Bombyx </p><p>Bombyx's Hui says the concept of regenerative agriculture takes organic farming to the next level. </p><p>\"On our farmland in Yilong County in Sichuan, the mulberry trees are grown on terraced hills to prevent nutrients in the soil leaching out during rain. We have protocols on regenerative agriculture principles for local farmers to follow. They have to adopt practices such as intercropping and crop rotation to preserve the soil. Chickens are kept on the farm to eat pests that might affect crops. Their droppings are used as natural fertiliser.\" </p><p>PFG, which both supplies fabric to clients and produces its own garments, has received certification for its environmentally friendly practices, such as the Swiss Bluesign accreditation for its dyeing procedures. However, Hui says Bombyx is the first company in the group that has gone the full distance in embracing green practices. </p><p>\"The 1-billion-yuan [US$140 million] project in Yilong County was built from scratch so we could make sure all the machinery and layout of the plant were designed in a way to conserve energy,\" he says. </p><p>He adds that managing the whole supply chain themselves ensures better quality control and cuts out middlemen which push up production costs. </p><p>\"Bombyx's high-end silk sells for a similar price or lower than silk produced in the traditional way. There's no point making high-end silk fabric that is out of reach of customers. Eighty per cent of the silk produced globally comes from China, but I believe we are the only silk producer in China that adopts such a 'through train' model.\" </p><p>Hui says that the fashion industry's embrace of regenerative farming not only helps the environment but also makes business sense, especially in China, where rising labour costs are forcing manufacturers to pursue more skilled, high-end production. </p><p>\"We had the idea to launch Bombyx and the silkworm breeding and processing base in Sichuan when faced with rising wages along [China's] coastline,\" he explains. \"As many of our workers in Zhuhai are from Sichuan province, it made sense for us to build a new facility there and bring the work to the workers instead of the other way around.

China is a huge market, and the US is a huge producer of agricultural products and technologies,\" said Roger Royse, founder of the AgTech Innovation Network in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He said there is increasing demand in China for agricultural technologies, driven by a labor shortage and consolidation of farmland.</p><p>Rural residents in China are moving to the cities, which leaves fewer farmers. Most of the people who stay behind are under 16 or over 50, so automation has to step in and fill that gap, Royse said.</p><p>Another factor is China's growing middle class, whose changing tastes and demand for more nutritious food also drive the development and deployment of agriculture and food technologies.</p><p>\"There are more people moving into the middle class, and their taste changes. They start eating more protein or more meat. As 7 to 10 pounds of plant creates 1 pound of protein, that increases the demand for increased output,\" said Royse.</p><p>\"The only way you get increased output from the same or dwindling amount of land is by being more effective, and that's why precision agriculture is becoming so important in China now,\" he said.</p><p>Royse said that in the US, it's all about consumerism - that the consumers want is what drives products to the market.</p><p>\"Consumers in the United States want traceability; they want to know what chemicals are in their food, what kind of labor went into producing the food, and where it's from. Then suppliers respond to demand, and they have to adopt new technologies in order to do that,\" he explained.</p><p>The same is happening in China as more people move into the middle class and become much more concerned about what they consume, he added.</p><p>\"The technologies that are pretty commonplace in the US will probably become popular in China, there'll be natural demand for it and that will benefit US companies that are already used to deploying a certain technology,\" said Royse.</p><p>Earl Roemer, founder and president of Nu Life Market, a Scott City, Kansas-based sorghum producer, also sees the opportunity created by the rapidly growing Chinese middle class.</p><p>\"The middle class in China is growing extremely fast, and people are eating better and eating the foods that they desire,\" he said. \"China dominates because of demand, and the US dominates in terms of our ability to produce agriculture products.
