According to a recent statement issued by UCT, the research was conducted following the devastating Table Mountain fire in April 2021, during which UCT's historic Jagger Library, home to precious archival material, was gutted, with other buildings affected. </p><p>The fire, fuelled by strong winds and dry vegetation, had burnt for approximately four days and destroyed around 3,000 hectares on Table Mountain, with many having to evacuate their homes. The study, titled \"Time to Extinguish the Exotic Flame: Lessons from the 2021 Cape Town Fire,\" highlighted how plant leaf traits, particularly in ornamental exotic species, influence the speed and intensity of vegetation burning. Muthama Muasya, the study's senior author and an internationally recognized plant taxonomist and evolutionary biologist, said that while laboratory tests alone cannot fully predict how plants behave in real-world fires, they offer valuable insight into key characteristics that influence ignition, burn duration and intensity. The researchers analyzed 42 plant species -- 22 native and 20 exotic -- focusing on traits such as leaf thickness, surface area, and specific leaf area, finding that plants with thin leaves and a larger surface area per unit mass ignited more quickly, while species with thicker leaves burned for longer periods. \"Exotic species that combine large, thin leaves with tall, woody growth and high retention of dry or dead foliage are of particular concern. These characteristics dramatically increase combustibility and the ability to trap burning embers, especially under windy conditions,\" said Muasya. \"We call for a shift in how cities approach green infrastructure, urging city officials, landscapers and property owners to prioritize native species with lower flammability. We also stress the importance of raising public awareness about the hidden fire risks posed by attractive but hazardous plants,\" he added.

Its industrial output increased by 6.4 percent compared to the same period last year, with equipment manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing sectors posting rapid growth. </p><p>Lynch described these figures as \"undeniably impressive,\" noting they all point to an economy that remains dynamic and strategically driven. \"What's striking, and often missed in Western commentary, is just how resilient China has proven to be in the face of external shocks,\" he told Xinhua recently. \"Whether it's the fallout from U.S. tariffs, global supply chain disruptions, or rising geopolitical tension, China has shown a remarkable ability to absorb pressure and adapt,\" Lynch said, adding that the country has consistently demonstrated an ability to withstand global turbulence. In the first half of this year, China accelerated its push for green industrial development, with the output of eco-friendly products posting robust growth while new energy vehicle production alone jumped 41.4 percent year-on-year. China is leading huge parts of the world in sectors such as electric vehicles, and is doubling down on areas including artificial intelligence and green infrastructure, Lynch noted. \"If in many ways you want to go green, you need to work with China,\" he said, highlighting the country's pivotal role in global supply chains, particularly in the fields related to sustainability and clean energy. Faced with increasing geopolitical fragmentation, some economies turned inward and built walls. China continued to expand opening-up and cooperate with other countries. Lynch believed that British businesses need to reshape how they think about China, \"not just as a bilateral trading partner, but as a node in a much broader web of trade, capital and influence.\" He also noted that China's opening-up moves, such as establishing new free trade zones, facilitating cross-border data flow and further encouraging foreign investment, provide foreign businesses with opportunities in the fields of finance, digital economy and green development. Eyeing more cooperation between Britain and China, Lynch said the European country should focus on sectors where China's reform agenda aligns with Britain's own strength, including green technology, healthcare, digital infrastructure and supply chain resilience.

The U.S. National Weather Service noted Saturday that it had issued more than 3,600 flash flood warnings in 2025, a pace that could surpass the typical yearly total of about 4,000, as torrential downpours continued into late July. Texas has borne the brunt. </p><p>On July 4, walls of water swept through the Guadalupe River valley, killing at least 135 people statewide. Kerr County lost 107 lives in the tragedy, including dozens of children at a summer camp, according to local officials cited by environmental news outlet Grist. River gauges in nearby Kerrville showed water levels rising more than 11.3 meters in 45 minutes, overwhelming rescuers. Scientists said warm oceans had pumped record amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere this year, while a weak jet stream had allowed storm clouds to linger over the same areas. The combination made 2025's thunderstorms unusually intense, Jeffrey Basara, a meteorology professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, wrote for The Conversation on Friday. He added that regions east of the Rocky Mountains received at least 50 percent more rain than usual between mid-April and mid-July. Surface conditions compound the danger, the expert said, adding that saturated soils, steep terrain and sprawling pavement funnel water into creeks and streets at breakneck speed. The July 4 deluge struck the river's headwaters, which Basara called the worst possible setup, sending a torrent racing downstream. Climate change is also sharpening the edge. The latest science suggested the Texas Hill Country floods were about 7 percent more severe because higher temperatures intensify rainfall, Annalisa Peace, executive director of the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, wrote in the San Antonio Express News on Saturday. Basara warned the pattern was likely to intensify, citing climate models that showed the heaviest U.S. downpours would continue to grow stronger as temperatures climb, raising the risk of future flash flood disasters. Meanwhile, millions of U.S. homes are situated in flood-prone zones. Grist reported 7.9 million structures lie inside areas the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency labeled as having at least a 1-percent annual chance of flooding. Experts urged stronger building codes, updated flood maps and green infrastructure.

Results indicate that the WF in SX exhibited a fluctuating upward trend from 2004 to 2020, dominated by blue WF primarily driven by the expansion of agricultural irrigation. The model predicts the current probability of water sustainability is 41.9% in SX. Sensitivity analysis reveals that anthropogenic factors significantly influence the WF. Scenario analysis based on four distinct conditions demonstrates that changes in WF and pollutant emissions substantially affect water sustainability. Under future climate scenarios projected to 2030, despite potential increases in precipitation, rising population and economic growth will continue to intensify water demand pressure. Under policy constraint scenarios, regional water sustainability shows improvement. To achieve sustainable development in SX, it is essential to promote efficient irrigation and optimize crop structure, restrict industrial water consumption while enhancing wastewater reuse, improve residential water pricing and conservation measures, develop green infrastructure, and advance virtual water management to balance regional water resources.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The BN model effectively elucidates the interactions among factors within the water resource system, providing a robust scientific basis for formulating sound water management strategies.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Analyzing Water Footprint and Water Resources Sustainability In China's Arid Northwest With Bayesian Network.

Generalized additive models (GAMs) with a quasibinomial logit link and restricted maximum likelihood were used to model non-linear associations and interactions. Mixture effects and joint exposure-response surfaces were estimated using fast Bayesian kernel machine regression (fbKMR). Causal mediation analysis under a counterfactual framework was used to assess indirect effects of PM. in the greenness-CHD relationship. We identified predominantly J-shaped exposure-response relationships between key PM. constituents and CHD risk, with organic matter (OM) and black carbon (BC) exhibiting the steepest risk increases. Mixture modeling via fbKMR revealed a monotonic increase in CHD risk with joint pollutant exposure. NDVI showed a robust U-shaped association with CHDs, with lowest risk at moderate greenness. Seasonal analysis highlighted strong BC and OM effects in autumn and winter, sulfate in spring and winter, and a threshold pattern for ammonium in summer. Spatial heterogeneity was evident, with eastern coastal cities (e.g., Ningbo, Jiaxing) showing pronounced risk increases above 35 mg/m. Septal-type CHDs exhibited consistent positive associations with PM., while complex subtypes showed weaker patterns.

The BRI's arrival presented both risk and opportunity. Crucially, some researchers found that there has been a deliberate shift toward strategic alignment after initial friction. Now, Environmental Impact Assessments mirroring CRGE targets are mandated and technology transfer clauses demanded. The green BRI guidelines have become leverage.</p><p>This synergy is bearing fruit.

As research underscores, the China-Ethiopia BRI collaboration has matured far beyond isolated infrastructure projects, weaving together economic investment, environmental safeguards, technical training and shared green ambitions into a multifaceted tapestry. The emphasis on Greenfield investments in renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower, acts as the visible backbone, but the true strength lies in the supporting structures.</p><p>The systematic adoption of Environmental Impact Assessments scrutinizing project feasibility, the strategic deployment of loans promoting green public investment, and the critical transfer of skills enable Ethiopians to operate and sustain these technologies. Such evolution toward comprehensiveness reflects a vital learning curve acknowledged in the earlier exploration of Ethiopia's \"green vessel\". Thus, implementing robust green BRI guidelines and aligning them with Ethiopia's CRGE strategy and international environmental norms are not just beneficial, but essential foundational steps. The call for strict enforcement mechanisms binding all parties directly addresses the friction points, such as land, equity, deep skills transfer, highlighted in the Adama Wind Farm and Eastern Industrial Zone case studies. It translates the hard-won lessons of Ethiopia's experience into a non-negotiable demand: Policies must have teeth.</p><p>Furthermore, greater funding, whether foreign direct investment or concessional loans, can be channeled toward ecologically beneficial projects. This targeted investment is the fuel needed to scale the successes beyond flagship wind farms and pilot industrial zones, driving deeper decarbonization and broader climate resilience. Finally, the imperative for enhanced coordination resonates powerfully. It is no longer sufficient for the CRGE, green BRI principles and global environmental initiatives to coexist; they must be actively integrated and implemented in concert, creating a unified, powerful engine for sustainable development.

Early projects highlight both the potential for replicable models and the critical importance of embedding environmental and social safeguards from inception. And China's foreign direct investment position in Ethiopia favors a \"green-focused \"approach.</p><p>This Ethiopian chapter of BRI energy cooperation exemplifies a crucial shift: moving beyond extractive paradigms toward symbiosis. It showcases how Chinese technology and finance, when strategically aligned with African nations' green development agendas, can accelerate sustainable growth. The successes and stumbles here offer a blueprint for a new kind of partnership in which power generation fuels not just homes and industries, but shared aspirations for a resilient future.</p><p>Facing climate vulnerability and chronic energy poverty, Ethiopia has vowed to leapfrog fossil fuels. The BRI's arrival presented both risk and opportunity. Crucially, some researchers found that there has been a deliberate shift toward strategic alignment after initial friction. Now, Environmental Impact Assessments mirroring CRGE targets are mandated and technology transfer clauses demanded. The green BRI guidelines have become leverage.</p><p>This synergy is bearing fruit. One case is the wind and solar surge. Beyond the flagship 204-megawatt Adama Wind Farms, a solar PV plant at Adama Industrial Park diversifies renewables and reduces diesel dependence. Another case is the Eastern Industrial Zone, developed with Chinese investment, which became a test case.</p><p>The winds sweeping Ethiopia's highlands and the sun beating down on its rift valley now power more than turbines and panels; they power a comprehensive partnership. As research underscores, the China-Ethiopia BRI collaboration has matured far beyond isolated infrastructure projects, weaving together economic investment, environmental safeguards, technical training and shared green ambitions into a multifaceted tapestry. The emphasis on Greenfield investments in renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower, acts as the visible backbone, but the true strength lies in the supporting structures.</p><p>The systematic adoption of Environmental Impact Assessments scrutinizing project feasibility, the strategic deployment of loans promoting green public investment, and the critical transfer of skills enable Ethiopians to operate and sustain these technologies. Such evolution toward comprehensiveness reflects a vital learning curve acknowledged in the earlier exploration of Ethiopia's \"green vessel\". Thus, implementing robust green BRI guidelines and aligning them with Ethiopia's CRGE strategy and international environmental norms are not just beneficial, but essential foundational steps. The call for strict enforcement mechanisms binding all parties directly addresses the friction points, such as land, equity, deep skills transfer, highlighted in the Adama Wind Farm and Eastern Industrial Zone case studies. It translates the hard-won lessons of Ethiopia's experience into a non-negotiable demand: Policies must have teeth.</p><p>Furthermore, greater funding, whether foreign direct investment or concessional loans, can be channeled toward ecologically beneficial projects. This targeted investment is the fuel needed to scale the successes beyond flagship wind farms and pilot industrial zones, driving deeper decarbonization and broader climate resilience. Finally, the imperative for enhanced coordination resonates powerfully. It is no longer sufficient for the CRGE, green BRI principles and global environmental initiatives to coexist; they must be actively integrated and implemented in concert, creating a unified, powerful engine for sustainable development. Therefore, Ethiopia's journey offers more than a blueprint; it provides a mandate. The collaboration demonstrates that the BRI's promise of \"green development\" becomes tangible only when a comprehensive partnership, spanning finance, technology, capacity, regulation and enforceable standards is cemented.</p><p>Under the framework of the BRI, China is demonstrating a replicable model of South-South cooperation, providing tailored green technology and expertise that directly addresses Africa's dual energy and sustainability imperatives. By successfully deploying green infrastructure in challenging contexts such as Ethiopia, China proves its capacity as a global leader in practical, scalable renewable solutions, moving beyond rhetoric to tangible results. This collaboration prioritizes long-term, mutually beneficial economic partnerships rooted in Africa's own sustainable development goals, contrasting with conditional or extractive models.</p><p>Key implications are that China-Africa green cooperation offers developing nations a credible, demand-driven alternative pathway to modernization and energy security, reducing reliance on traditional global governance prescriptions. It provides an alternative to Western dominance in setting global development norms by showcasing a model built on respect for national aspirations, pragmatic technology transfer and shared green growth. Successfully navigating project complexities provides valuable experiences, strengthening the model's legitimacy and offering the Global South greater leverage in choosing development partners aligned with their sovereignty and environmental priorities.</p><p>China's collaborative green energy ventures in Africa provide a powerful, positive counter-model to the traditional governance supremacy. By delivering tailored solutions that meet both developmental and environmental needs on mutually beneficial terms, China empowers other Global South nations with a practical, sustainable alternative pathway, reshaping development dynamics and asserting its positive role through demonstrable action and partnership.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202507/17/6878314ea310af1d84211775.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202507/17/6878314ea310af1d84211777.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>LI MIN/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The author is former commissioner of the Federal Civil Service, director of the Civil Service Reform Program in Ethiopia, and a deputy CEO of Ethiopia Sugar Corporation.

In an opinion piece published Sunday on the Arab-language online news portal elfikr.net, Kharrachi, also president of the Association of Mauritanian Alumni of Chinese Universities, noted that the Mauritania-China friendship has become a model for South-South cooperation. From the outset, bilateral ties have been built on mutual respect, solidarity, non-interference, and win-win cooperation, gradually expanding across key sectors and injecting sustained momentum into Mauritania's development, the author said. Over the past six decades, Mauritania and China have supported each other on issues concerning their core interests and have maintained a consistent position on major international affairs, Kharrachi said. </p><p>\"It is a relationship that was not merely a matter of diplomatic protocols, but rather was and still is a living pulse flowing through the arteries of the two countries, manifested in giant projects, starting with the Friendship Port and ending with the Friendship Bridge, passing through hospitals and roads that have facilitated the lives of Mauritanian citizens,\" he said. \"These projects are not just concrete structures, but living testaments to China's commitment to supporting Mauritania on its path to progress and prosperity,\" Kharrachi said. China, now Mauritania's largest trading partner, was also considered one of the largest donor and investor countries in Mauritania, having implemented around 100 projects in various fields over the past 40 years, he said. \"Its presence in the national economy has become strong, given its importance and direct impact on the lives of every Mauritanian citizen. The COVID-19 pandemic is not far off, as China has proven to be the best friend in times of need,\" Kharrachi said. In recent years, he said, bilateral relations have entered a fast track, yielding remarkable results. The two sides signed a cooperation plan for jointly building the Belt and Road, and Mauritania formally joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The relationship has since been upgraded to a strategic partnership. Mauritania's signing of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation further indicates that Mauritania-China relations are embracing unprecedented opportunities for growth, Kharrachi said. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has opened broader space for cooperation, he said, noting that currently, bilateral cooperation is advancing in three key directions: -- Aligning development strategies by leveraging Mauritania's geographic strengths to promote the building of an Africa-China community with a shared future; -- Expanding digital economy cooperation through the \"Digital Silk Road,\" enabling win-win outcomes in cross-border e-commerce, smart ports, and remote education; -- Deepening green development cooperation, including multilateral partnerships in clean energy, environmental protection, and mineral value chains, to help Africa tackle climate change and energy transition.

In Miyun, heavy downpours flooded the mountainous areas and lowlands alike, causing the tragic loss of lives and leaving many missing \u2014 the worst such disaster Beijing has faced in nearly a decade because of the area receiving almost a year's rainfall in a single day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several factors caused this disaster. The Western Pacific subtropical high, a large-scale anti-cyclonic circulation located over the subtropical Pacific throughout the year which reaches its peak in boreal summer (Northern Hemisphere summer) and heavily influences East Asian summer, shifted unusually northward, gaining in strength, nudging China's primary rain belt further north and prolonging its stay. Meanwhile, distant typhoons acted like offshore \"pressure pumps\" funneling warm, moist air from the Western Pacific into northern China. This continuous infusion of moist air saturated the rain belt, causing extreme precipitation.</p><p>The topography amplified the effect. Northern China is surrounded by the Taihang Mountains in the west and the Yanshan Mountains in the north. The warm, moist air flowing inland, forced upward by these mountains, first cools down and then condenses to cause heavy rainfall. That's why the mountainous areas as well as the foothills \u2014 Miyun district in Beijing and Yixian county in Hebei \u2014 had to bear the brunt of the deluge.</p><p>But not just the mountains are at play here. Situated along the mid-latitude, northern China is exposed to cold fronts sweeping down from the higher latitudes. When they collide with tropical moist air, huge walls of cloud form, triggering torrential downpours.</p><p>Rainfall involves the transformation of staggering amounts of energy into water in vapor form, which changes to liquid. During China's summer-rainy season, these rain belts span vast areas, generating super-strong winds, lightning, hail, and even tornadoes. Nature's power, in short, is spectacular and indiscriminate.</p><p>Northern China's climate adds another twist. The region experiences sharply contrasting winter and summer winds, which create distinctly dry and wet seasons. Summer heat coincides with peak rainfall, further nourishing fertile farmlands. Yet this \"rain-heat synchronicity\" is a double-edged sword: a large percentage of the annual precipitation develops within a few months, often in concentrated bursts, which cause floods and landslides.</p><p>Climate change has made matters worse. Rising temperatures increase atmospheric moisture, intensifying storms and a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, so when storms form, they can dump more rain in a shorter time. According to the World Meteorological Organization, every degree of global warming is projected to cause a 7 percent increase in extreme daily rainfall. And the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says heavy precipitation events are increasing in intensity and frequency globally. In China, this has manifested as more destructive flooding, underscoring the urgent need for forward-looking policies.</p><p>In the past, northern China's wetlands, ponds and rivers acted as natural buffers, absorbing rainwater and gradually releasing it, diminishing the contrast between the wet and dry seasons. But development and modernization disturbed the natural phenomenon. Flood management, therefore, should not be only about \"draining\" water; it should be also about integrating year-round water resource planning.</p><p>The frontline has shifted from major rivers to small streams, mountain gullies and local watersheds. Traditional solutions \u2014 dredging, widening and deepening of channels \u2014 often backfire, unleashing the full force of floods downstream and overwhelming flat, low-lying areas. Decentralized, nature-based structures \u2014 small dams, terraces, stepwise wetlands \u2014 are needed to dissipate energy, and \"pocket reservoirs\" are required for absorbing peak water flows during storms. Multifunctional flood storage areas can double as recreational spaces when they are dry, providing safety while enhancing local tourism and green infrastructure.</p><p>Truly extreme events \u2014 \"a year's rainfall in a single day\" \u2014 are still rare. Building \"millennial\" infrastructure is costly, disruptive, and could still be insufficient to deal with worsening climate change. A more pragmatic approach would be to embrace the limits of engineering and the extremes of disasters. Certain areas can be designated as temporary flood zones, parks or water retention spaces, turning potential catastrophes into ecological and recreational opportunities. Green spaces and wetlands will thus become essential buffers safeguarding lives and livelihoods.</p><p>Extreme rainfall affords no trial and error. We need meticulous planning and investment to reduce future losses. Governments, communities and individuals must be aware of the looming risks, and build adaptive infrastructure and devise emergency plans. Only then can we declare \"we are ready\" when storm clouds gather.</p><p>Downpours in northern China remind us that nature can be both generous and ruthless. We cannot command the clouds, but we can prepare intelligently to deal with heavy downpours. By respecting ecological limits, integrating urban planning with water management, and embracing flexible, multi-functional solutions, we can turn extreme rainfall from a threat to an opportunity, thus protecting lives, supporting sustainable development, and ensuring that when an entire year's rainfall falls in a single day, we are not caught off guard.</p><p>The author is deputy director of the Center for Monsoon System Research Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.</p><p>If you have a specific expertise, or would like to share your thought about our stories, then send us your writings at opinion@chinadaily.com  .cn, and comment@chinadaily.com  .cn.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202508/16/689fe319a310b236b651ddd0.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202508/16/689fe319a310b236b651ddd0.png\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["Traditional solutions \u2014 dredging, widening and deepening of channels \u2014 often backfire, unleashing the full force of floods downstream and overwhelming flat, low-lying areas.

Quite the contrary, it knows that if the US abandons its climate commitments, global efforts to keep temperatures across the world below catastrophic warming thresholds will be extremely difficult, if not impossible.

This initiative offers landowners and business owners an attractive opportunity to generate stable, long-term income while participating in the growth of the green technology sector. The move marks a strategic milestone in V-Green's efforts to expand its regional infrastructure footprint and accelerate the development of a comprehensive EV ecosystem. </p><p><br/><br/>Under this model, V-Green seeks to collaborate with property owners who meet the required site criteria, with no upfront investment required from partners. V-Green will cover the full cost of equipment installation, three-phase electrical connection, and 24/7 operation and maintenance. Partners benefit from a revenue-sharing arrangement, unlocking the potential of underutilized real estate while enjoying reliable returns. With a minimum lease term of five years, the model ensures zero financial risk and no operational burden for participating partners. <br/><br/>V-Green is currently prioritizing locations in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao, with site areas ranging from 30 to 1,000 square meters. Ideal sites are easy to access and recognize, close to three-phase power sources, and have a solid concrete foundation suitable for charger installation. <br/><br/>\"We believe that EV charging stations will become a standard feature across all types of real estate developments in the Philippines within the next five years,\" said Mr. Luu Viet Hung, CEO of V-Green Philippines. \"With our flexible business model and advanced technological platform, V-Green is committed to working hand-in-hand with local partners to deliver smart EV charging infrastructure \u2014 a solution that not only enhances property value but also drives the country's transition toward a greener future.\" <br/><br/>In addition to directly investing in its own charging stations, V-Green also plans to introduce a franchise model in the Philippines. This approach, which has already proven successful in Vietnam, enables broader market participation while accelerating network coverage. V-Green currently operates over 150,000 charging ports nationwide in Vietnam through a combination of self-operated and franchised stations. Further details on the franchise opportunity in the Philippines will be announced soon. <br/><br/>Partnering with V-Green is more than just leasing land \u2014 it's an opportunity to become part of a thriving green tech ecosystem. Site owners can maximize existing assets without the need for capital expenditure or technical operations. V-Green takes full responsibility for deployment, maintenance, and operations, ensuring seamless integration and optimized cost-efficiency. <br/><br/>Installing EV charging stations also drives increased customer traffic and dwell time, boosting revenue for adjacent services such as retail, food &amp; beverage, and utilities. Moreover, the presence of a V-Green station enhances the modern, eco-conscious image of the property, offering a clear competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market where sustainability is increasingly prioritized by consumers. <br/><br/>To explore partnership opportunities with V-Green in the Philippines, please contact:  or Hotline: +63 9524904529 (Mr. Huynh Minh Tuan (Calvin)) <br/>Hashtag: #V-Green<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://vgreen.net/en\">https://vgreen.net/en</url></p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p><p>About V-Green</p><p>V-Green Global Charging Station Development JSC is a pioneer in green infrastructure solutions, committed to building a smart, flexible, and user-friendly EV charging ecosystem that supports the global transition to sustainable energy.

The model is applied to the case of central Beijing, China, and demonstrates a robust performance with a high area under curve (AUC) value of 0.94. The results of the urban flood susceptibility assessment identify the urban-rural transition zone in the study area as being under a greater flood threat. Via model interpretation with SHAP, the dominant roles of GI and grey infrastructure (GrI) in preventing flood are revealed and the non-linear complementarity between the two is demonstrated to be more significant in study units with a GI proportion of less than 0.45. Supported by the NSGA-II-based optimization framework, optimal GI plans under different total implementations of GI are achieved, among which a solution with a 3.21% increase in the total GI area is selected as that with the best investment efficiency.

For Africa, South Asia, and other Southern regions, the challenge is not only to expand energy access but to do so equitably, without exacerbating environmental degradation or social inequality. In this unfolding energy transition, China's growing leadership in renewable energy and green infrastructure presents both opportunity and responsibility. Its investments and technology exports are increasingly shaping the energy future of the Global South.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a dominant force in the global renewable energy landscape. It is the world's largest producer, exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. In 2023 alone, China accounted for over 60 percent of global solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing output and over 70 percent of global battery production. It has also become a major financier and builder of green infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America through platforms such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund.</p><p>In Africa, Chinese companies have played a significant role in expanding access to solar energy in rural communities, where traditional grid expansion remains cost-prohibitive. From solar mini-grids in Kenya and Nigeria to hydropower and wind energy projects in Ethiopia and South Africa, China's presence is reshaping the continent's energy mix. The Garissa Solar Plant in Kenya, built by China Jiangxi International Economic and Technical Cooperation Co Ltd, is among the largest solar plants in East Africa and has been instrumental in improving grid stability. Similarly, in South and Southeast Asia, Chinese investment has helped countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam develop large-scale solar and wind installations that contribute to energy diversification and resilience. The Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park in Pakistan, one of the largest in Asia, was constructed with Chinese financing and expertise and now contributes significantly to the country's power grid.</p><p>Yet the significance of China's role extends beyond hardware and finance. It is also influencing the structure of global energy governance. As Western investors and multilateral institutions often hesitate to back large-scale projects in fragile or low-income states due to risk or debt concerns, China is filling the gap \u2014 albeit with its own strategic calculus. By offering concessional loans, blended finance and turnkey engineering solutions, China enables countries in the Global South to leapfrog into renewable energy without relying on fossil-intensive pathways. In doing so, it offers a model of development that sidesteps the fossil fuel dependency that once characterized industrial growth in the West, aligning more closely with climate imperatives outlined in the Paris Agreement.</p><p>However, for this partnership to support a truly just energy transition, several conditions must be met.</p><p>First, Chinese-financed renewable energy projects should be embedded in local development plans that prioritize job creation, technology transfer and environmental safeguards. A just transition requires more than decarbonization \u2014 it demands economic inclusion and empowerment. Joint ventures, skills training and local manufacturing of green technologies must become integral to China's energy engagements. Encouragingly, there are examples of progress: Chinese solar companies have partnered with local manufacturers in Egypt's Benban Solar Park to produce solar panels domestically, while in Ethiopia, the Aysha Wind Farm project included provisions for training local engineers. These models must be replicated and scaled to ensure broad-based benefits and sustainable ownership.</p><p>Second, transparency and debt sustainability are critical. While many African and Asian governments welcome Chinese finance for energy infrastructure, concerns remain about opaque loan terms and debt distress. A just transition cannot be built on an unsustainable financial foundation. Instruments such as the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments could serve as a platform for constructive dialogue. Furthermore, building capacity in host governments to conduct robust cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments is vital to ensure projects are not only viable but also socially and environmentally responsible.</p><p>Third, China's leadership in critical supply chains \u2014 particularly in solar panels and battery storage, could play a transformative role in democratizing access to green technologies. Currently, developing countries face barriers in accessing affordable and high-quality renewable energy components due to supply chain bottlenecks and trade restrictions. By expanding South-South technology partnerships, licensing agreements, and knowledge exchanges, China can help the Global South reduce its dependency on Northern technology monopolies and diversify the sources of clean energy innovation. China's establishment of renewable energy training centers and innovation hubs across Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa could accelerate the diffusion of clean technologies, support regional manufacturing bases, and create ecosystems of innovation that are adapted to local conditions and climate risks.</p><p>Importantly, China's recent shift toward greening the Belt and Road \u2014 through initiatives such as the BRI International Green Development Coalition and its 2021 pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad \u2014 signals a positive turn. But implementation remains uneven. Some countries still see a mix of fossil and renewable investments, and many struggle to ensure environmental compliance. A just energy transition must be consistent and comprehensive. It cannot afford to be undermined by contradictory practices. Monitoring and accountability mechanisms \u2014 jointly developed with host countries and civil society actors \u2014 can ensure that green commitments are translated into practice. Strengthening environmental and social impact assessments and enhancing public participation in project design are essential steps toward greater legitimacy and trust in Chinese-supported green infrastructure.</p><p>As the world looks toward COP30 and other global climate milestones, the role of China in shaping a fair, inclusive and sustainable energy transition in the Global South will continue to grow. African and Asian countries, together with China, should strengthen collaborative efforts to co-design energy projects that align with local development priorities and global climate commitments. At the same time, international financial institutions and Western donors should recognize and complement these efforts, rather than compete or isolate. There is an urgent need to move from fragmented initiatives to coordinated and synergistic action \u2014 where Chinese, Western and multilateral actors work together to close the global energy access gap and support climate justice.</p><p>China's capabilities in renewable energy \u2014 its innovation, industrial scale and capital \u2014 can be transformative for the Global South. The future of global energy security depends not just on reducing carbon emissions, but on building systems that are resilient, inclusive and shared. In this, China has both the tools \u2014 and the responsibility \u2014 to lead.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202504/28/680eb8b5a3101d7ae151134d.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>WANG XIAOYING/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202504/28/680eb8b5a3101d7ae1511350.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The author is a visiting senior fellow at Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa at the London School of Economics and Political Science, a senior fellow at the African Center for Economic Transformation, deputy executive director of the Global South-North Center and a visiting associate professor at the Wits School of Governance at University of Witwatersrand.

A total of 410 peacekeepers of the 20th Chinese peacekeeping contingent to Lebanon were awarded UN medals of peace at the ceremony<br/><br/>In the mid-20th century, the international order that underpins our world today emerged from the wreckage of World War II. The creation of the United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank reflected an unprecedented aspiration: To replace conflict with cooperation, chaos with rules and power politics with multilateralism. The victors of the war envisioned a framework that could secure peace, rebuild economies and promote collective progress.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>As one of the original founding members of the UN and a participant in the negotiations that shaped the post-war order, China was recognized for its role and its sacrifices during the conflict. Yet, due to the complexities of the Cold War geopolitics, the People's Republic of China was excluded from direct participation in many of these institutions for nearly 30 years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>During those formative decades, the governance of global institutions was largely dominated by Western powers, whose economic and military strength shaped the rules, structures and priorities of the international system. These institutions reflected a world order characterized by hierarchies of power and privilege that often failed to fully account for the voices and interests of developing nations, especially those in Asia, Africa and South America.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Today, in 2025, as the world observes the 80th anniversary of the UN's establishment, the landscape has changed profoundly. China is not only participating in the existing order but actively shaping a more inclusive, representative and development-focused future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>From sidelines to center<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the UN, China is now the second largest contributor to the regular budget and the leading peacekeeping troop contributor among the permanent members of the Security Council. In peacekeeping missions, China's presence signals a growing commitment to international stability through action rather than rhetoric.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the IMF and World Bank, China is the third largest shareholder. It uses its influence to advocate for reform\u2014seeking greater voice and representation for developing countries that have long been sidelined. At the World Trade Organization, China has become the world's largest trader in goods and a vigorous supporter of multilateral trade rules, even as others embrace protectionism.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But China has also recognized that many of these institutions, created in the 1940s, can no longer meet the challenges of the 21st century. Rather than reject or replace them, China has sought to complement them\u2014by building new platforms that are more responsive to the needs of developing countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), initiated by China in 2015, now has over 100 members. Its mission is clear: To finance the infrastructure necessary for sustainable growth in the developing world. Operating under rigorous governance standards and free from political strings, the AIIB presents a new model of multilateral finance\u2014pragmatic, inclusive and development-oriented.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, co-founded by China and once focused on border demilitarization, has evolved into a broad-based regional forum encompassing diplomacy, trade and cultural exchange.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most ambitious of all is the Belt and Road Initiative\u2014a China-proposed global infrastructure and connectivity initiative that spans over 140 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. This initiative is narrowing development gaps and creating new engines of shared prosperity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>These initiatives are tied together by a coherent strategic vision articulated by President Xi Jinping: the construction of a community with a shared future for humanity. This vision emphasizes common development, mutual security, civilizational diversity and multilateral cooperation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three global initiatives<br/><br/><br/><br/>China's vision for a better world has been outlined in three global initiatives that anchor its foreign policy:<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Global Development Initiative, launched in 2021, brings sustainable development back to the heart of the global agenda. With a focus on poverty alleviation, education, healthcare and digital infrastructure, it aims to accelerate progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ensure no country is left behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Global Security Initiative, introduced in 2022, calls for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. Rejecting zero-sum thinking and Cold War mentalities, it urges states to resolve disputes through dialogue, not confrontation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Global Civilizations Initiative, presented in 2023, highlights respect for diversity in governance models, development paths and cultural traditions. It advocates mutual learning among civilizations rather than ideological export or imposition.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Together, these three initiatives provide a moral and strategic foundation for China's approach to global governance: inclusive, balanced and respectful of sovereignty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regional and global engagement<br/><br/><br/><br/>China has embraced a layered model of engagement\u2014deepening cooperation with major economies, regional partners and emerging powers alike.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Within BRICS, a group of emerging economies originally consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, China advocates reforms in global financial governance and promotes South-South cooperation. The BRICS-created New Development Bank offers an alternative to legacy financial institutions by prioritizing member-led development projects without political conditionality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Group of 20 (G20), China plays a pivotal role in driving consensus on digital economy governance, sustainable development financing and green infrastructure investment. It often serves as a bridge between the developed and developing worlds, championing equitable globalization.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Through Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cooperation, China supports regional economic integration, disaster response capacity and digital transformation initiatives. The ASEAN-China Free Trade Area remains one of the most dynamic regional trade frameworks, emphasizing mutual growth through dialogue and connectivity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), China actively contributes to promoting trade liberalization, innovation and inclusive digitalization across the Pacific Rim. Its active role in APEC reinforces its commitment to open regionalism and multilateral cooperation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>China is also a key member of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade pact comprising the 10 ASEAN member states and five of their major trading partners, namely, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand, and has formally applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a high-standard free trade agreement among 11 Asia-Pacific economies. These steps reflect China's desire to integrate deeper into global value chains and uphold high-standard trade rules.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Convening and creating<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of China's most significant contributions to global governance is its growing \"convening power.\" It hosts and sponsors a wide array of international platforms that foster policy dialogue and practical cooperation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Boao Forum for Asia gathers policymakers, business leaders and scholars to discuss regional economic integration, innovation and sustainability.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has institutionalized China-Africa relations, producing tangible outcomes in health, education and infrastructure across the African continent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States Forum builds bridges between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries, promoting people-to-people exchange and economic partnerships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The China Development Forum is a premier venue for global business leaders and academic thinkers to engage directly with China's top policymakers. It plays a critical role in policy transparency and forward-looking economic dialogue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The China International Import Expo (CIIE), the first national-level import-themed trade fair in the world, demonstrates China's willingness to open its markets. Since its launch in 2018, the CIIE has provided a platform for foreign businesses to access China's vast consumer base while encouraging balanced trade and global market access.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Embracing shared leadership<br/><br/><br/><br/>China's growing presence in the global arena is often misunderstood. Some critics portray its actions as attempts to upend the existing order. Yet this narrative misrepresents China's approach and intentions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The nation does not seek hegemony. It does not aim to dismantle the current system but to reform and enhance it so that it better reflects today's multipolar, interconnected world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its approach can be summarized in three core commitments:<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022 To build, not to break: Strengthening international institutions rather than abandoning them;<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022 To connect, not to divide: Promoting integration, not decoupling;<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022 To collaborate, not to confront: Addressing global challenges through collective, rather than unilateral, action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The success of this vision cannot depend on China alone. It requires openness and responsibility from all members of the international community.

In a recent interview with Xinhua, Stelzel emphasized that the Port of Rotterdam is undergoing a profound transformation in response to global shifts. \"Just like in other ports, we're in the midst of the biggest transitions in decades -- geopolitical transitions and social cultural transitions, technological transitions,\" she noted. </p><p>Recognizing the evolving role of ports, she said: \"In the future and probably already today, our performance will no longer be measured by volume profitability or share price only, but by the impact that we create for our societies.\" To support its 2050 carbon neutrality goal, the Port of Rotterdam is investing in key green infrastructure projects. These include facilities for green hydrogen supply, offshore wind parks, electrolyzers, and carbon capture and storage installations in the North Sea. Beyond energy infrastructure, Stelzel emphasized that the port is also accelerating efforts in sustainable shipping. \"We are focusing on green and smart shipping as well. We are currently working on the necessary facilities. You already have them in China at a larger scale. Think about shore power for different types of vessels,\" she said. She further noted the development of bunker facilities for sustainable fuels and preparations for the electrification of inland barges. However, she also acknowledged the scale of the challenge. \"Although regulations and laws and a level playing field remain important preconditions for the transition, we also require more knowledge and greater innovative capacity to accelerate the transitions. And this requires a wide range of efforts from every organization in the industry, many of which are by no means inconsiderable.\" \"It is a complex challenge ... that we can only overcome and win by joining our forces,\" she said. \"Our goal in Rotterdam is to become the most sustainable port in the world,\" Stelzel affirmed. Stelzel expressed strong interest in strengthening ties with China's logistics and energy sectors. \"Sustaining the pivotal connection with the Port Authority and the logistics and energy sector in China remains a priority for us at Port of Rotterdam Authority in this journey, and our focus is on intensifying cooperation towards ambitious decarbonization initiatives within the shipping sector.\" She called for deeper international collaboration, saying, \"This involves fostering collaboration in sharing insights and coordinating efforts within existing green shipping corridors and exploring new avenues for joint endeavors in the region.\" \"Together, we can address the collective challenges faced by the industry and take proactive measures to address them,\" she said. She underscored the broader mission of the port's sustainability efforts: \"Together, we can create value throughout the whole supply chain, not just for our shareholders, but for our customers, for partners and suppliers and the world at large.\" The director concluded by expressing her hope to host more Chinese partners in the Port of Rotterdam in the near future.

This dramatic law marks a turning point in America's sustainability agenda, rolling back support for clean energy, electric vehicles, and low-carbon technologies. While it is widely regarded as a major policy reversal undermining US climate leadership, the shift opens a window of opportunity for China and other clean-tech leaders to expand their influence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The OBBB represents a broad rollback of US clean-energy policy, repealing key provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and dismantling decades of bipartisan support for green infrastructure. By scrapping tax credits for rooftop solar panels, EV purchases, and energy-efficient heat pumps, the OBBB makes clean technologies significantly more expensive for consumers \u2014 undermining progress toward affordable, low-carbon living.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The law also halts federal support for green manufacturing, jeopardizing over $100 billion in planned investments in EV, solar, and battery factories, and putting an estimated 115,000 jobs at risk. Even before its passage, policy uncertainty had led to $6.9 billion in project cancellations in early 2025. The message is unmistakable: The US is retreating from climate leadership. This retreat could ripple across global supply chains and slow the energy transition at a critical juncture.</p><p>With tax credits gone, solar and wind projects now face higher upfront costs \u2014 expenses likely passed on to consumers already strained by inflation. In an ironic twist, many Republican-led states that prospered during the clean-energy boom may end up suffering most from the rollback. Experts warn that the US could install up to 72 percent less new renewable energy over the next decade, undoing recent gains and increasing reliance on aging fossil-fueled power plants.</p><p>On the global stage, the fallout is serious: higher emissions, a weakened US commitment to the Paris Agreement, and eroded American credibility in climate diplomacy. Strategically, the OBBB shift undercuts US competitiveness in high-tech and energy-intensive industries \u2014 as worldwide demand for clean power is surging. Without ample green energy at home, the US risks falling behind countries like China that are forging ahead in innovation.</p><p>Despite its promises of boosting affordability, creating jobs, and outcompeting China, the OBBB appears to undermine those very aims. By repealing key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the nation's flagship clean-energy law \u2014 the new law dismantles support for domestic manufacturing in sectors such as EVs, batteries, and other emerging green industries, along with plans to drive down future energy costs. In place of these investments, the law reverts to fossil fuels: It authorizes as much as $18 billion in new and expanded tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and leaves longstanding advantages for coal and natural gas untouched.</p><p>Critics call this strategy a strategic misstep. Many observers attribute the move to vigorous fossil-fuel lobbying or partisan politics. Republican backers of the bill argued that clean tech can now stand on its own, yet traditional fossil industries still enjoy extensive government support. This policy U-turn also sends a troubling message abroad. America's credibility in global climate negotiations weakens with each reversal, eroding trust among allies.</p><p>China's clean-tech strides: filling the void</p><p>While the US steps back from climate commitments, China is surging ahead. Already the world's leading producer of renewable energy, China continues to expand its lead at an astonishing pace. In 2024 alone, it installed 277 gigawatts (GW) of new solar capacity \u2014 a 45 percent jump from the previous year \u2014 and boosted its wind power capacity by 18 percent, reaching roughly 887 GW of solar and 520 GW of wind in total. This far outstrips the US, which had only about 139 GW of solar capacity as of 2023. China even met its 2030 clean-energy capacity targets six years early, at the same time as the US was retreating from the Paris Agreement and increasing its reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p>This dominance is no accident. China's sustained and supportive industrial policies have nurtured a fiercely competitive clean-tech market at home. Even foreign companies like Tesla have thrived under China's approach; Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, fast-tracked with government support, became the company's largest global production hub. As the US weakens its own clean-tech strategy, China is poised to further consolidate its leadership. This shift has far-reaching implications: not only for global supply chains and technology standards, but also for the balance of economic and geopolitical power in a low-carbon future.</p><p>The rollback of US EV incentives comes as competition in the auto industry is heating up \u2014 creating major openings for China's EV sector. China already manufactures over 60 percent of the world's EVs and around 80 percent of its batteries, controlling much of the supply chain from raw minerals to finished cars.</p><p>Thanks to massive scale, innovation, and consistent government backing, Chinese EVs are often cheaper than comparable gasoline vehicles. In emerging markets from Brazil to Ethiopia, Chinese EV brands are leading the electric transition in places where Western automakers have been largely absent.</p><p>With American consumer tax credits now gone, US automakers such as General Motors and Ford face a tougher road for their EV plans. At the same time, new rules barring components from \"foreign entities of concern\" are hindering domestic battery manufacturing. Ironically, many of the battery plants planned in the US still rely on Chinese materials and technology \u2014 meaning efforts to exclude China could end up crippling America's own EV supply chain.</p><p>Meanwhile, China's automakers continue to expand their global reach. BYD, for example, saw its revenue in 2024 surpass Tesla's, and it is on track to lead the world in EV sales in 2025. Even Tesla \u2014 deeply tied into China's supply chain \u2014 has cautioned that Chinese competitors could outcompete traditional US carmakers if current trends continue.</p><p>Western trade barriers have begun to pose headwinds, but Chinese companies are adapting quickly \u2014 building overseas plants, introducing more hybrid models to sidestep tariffs, and leveraging their huge domestic market to maintain scale advantages. Despite these hurdles, China's EV exports keep climbing \u2014 in April, registrations of Chinese-made electric cars in Europe jumped 59 percent year-on-year despite the new EU tariffs. As the US pulls back, China is accelerating its push into global markets. If current trends hold, Chinese automakers may soon dominate the global EV landscape, while American brands struggle to keep up in a fast-moving industry that increasingly spans the globe.</p><p>Clean future will forge ahead</p><p>There is little doubt that the global transition to a clean-energy future will persist. The passage of the OBBB marks a turning point where Washington has chosen to prioritize short-term fossil-fuel interests over long-term sustainability. Yet this US reversal is not slowing the pace of the global energy transition \u2014 China and other nations are stepping into leadership roles to push green development forward.</p><p>China's path has not been without challenges \u2014 coal still plays a significant role in its energy mix \u2014 but its success in deploying solutions at scale is increasingly evident. At the 17th BRICS Summit held in July in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of major emerging economies reaffirmed their commitment to inclusive climate action through the Rio de Janeiro Declaration, themed \"Strengthening Global South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance\". The declaration emphasized sustainable development and equitable green transitions \u2014 principles China has been putting into practice through its clean-energy investments across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p><p>Unless the US reengages with this worldwide green momentum soon, it risks ceding economic and technological leadership to those forward-looking nations already shaping the 21st century's green economy.</p><p>The author is director of research at the Institute of Innovative and High-Quality Development (Hong Kong).</p><p>The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://campus-cdhk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/store_manager/photo_pre/13/44/87/d65a783d-8e73-4200-9689-096241b3314e/high_wm.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["This dramatic law marks a turning point in America's sustainability agenda, rolling back support for clean energy, electric vehicles, and low-carbon technologies.

For Africa, South Asia, and other Southern regions, the challenge is not only to expand energy access but to do so equitably, without exacerbating environmental degradation or social inequality. In this unfolding energy transition, China's growing leadership in renewable energy and green infrastructure presents both opportunity and responsibility. Its investments and technology exports are increasingly shaping the energy future of the Global South.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a dominant force in the global renewable energy landscape. It is the world's largest producer, exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. In 2023 alone, China accounted for over 60 percent of global solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing output and over 70 percent of global battery production. It has also become a major financier and builder of green infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America through platforms such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund.</p><p>In Africa, Chinese companies have played a significant role in expanding access to solar energy in rural communities, where traditional grid expansion remains cost-prohibitive. From solar mini-grids in Kenya and Nigeria to hydropower and wind energy projects in Ethiopia and South Africa, China's presence is reshaping the continent's energy mix. The Garissa Solar Plant in Kenya, built by China Jiangxi International Economic and Technical Cooperation Co Ltd, is among the largest solar plants in East Africa and has been instrumental in improving grid stability. Similarly, in South and Southeast Asia, Chinese investment has helped countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam develop large-scale solar and wind installations that contribute to energy diversification and resilience. The Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park in Pakistan, one of the largest in Asia, was constructed with Chinese financing and expertise and now contributes significantly to the country's power grid.</p><p>Yet the significance of China's role extends beyond hardware and finance. It is also influencing the structure of global energy governance. As Western investors and multilateral institutions often hesitate to back large-scale projects in fragile or low-income states due to risk or debt concerns, China is filling the gap \u2014 albeit with its own strategic calculus. By offering concessional loans, blended finance and turnkey engineering solutions, China enables countries in the Global South to leapfrog into renewable energy without relying on fossil-intensive pathways. In doing so, it offers a model of development that sidesteps the fossil fuel dependency that once characterized industrial growth in the West, aligning more closely with climate imperatives outlined in the Paris Agreement.</p><p>However, for this partnership to support a truly just energy transition, several conditions must be met.</p><p>First, Chinese-financed renewable energy projects should be embedded in local development plans that prioritize job creation, technology transfer and environmental safeguards. A just transition requires more than decarbonization \u2014 it demands economic inclusion and empowerment. Joint ventures, skills training and local manufacturing of green technologies must become integral to China's energy engagements. Encouragingly, there are examples of progress: Chinese solar companies have partnered with local manufacturers in Egypt's Benban Solar Park to produce solar panels domestically, while in Ethiopia, the Aysha Wind Farm project included provisions for training local engineers. These models must be replicated and scaled to ensure broad-based benefits and sustainable ownership.</p><p>Second, transparency and debt sustainability are critical. While many African and Asian governments welcome Chinese finance for energy infrastructure, concerns remain about opaque loan terms and debt distress. A just transition cannot be built on an unsustainable financial foundation. Instruments such as the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments could serve as a platform for constructive dialogue. Furthermore, building capacity in host governments to conduct robust cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments is vital to ensure projects are not only viable but also socially and environmentally responsible.</p><p>Third, China's leadership in critical supply chains \u2014 particularly in solar panels and battery storage, could play a transformative role in democratizing access to green technologies. Currently, developing countries face barriers in accessing affordable and high-quality renewable energy components due to supply chain bottlenecks and trade restrictions. By expanding South-South technology partnerships, licensing agreements, and knowledge exchanges, China can help the Global South reduce its dependency on Northern technology monopolies and diversify the sources of clean energy innovation. China's establishment of renewable energy training centers and innovation hubs across Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa could accelerate the diffusion of clean technologies, support regional manufacturing bases, and create ecosystems of innovation that are adapted to local conditions and climate risks.</p><p>Importantly, China's recent shift toward greening the Belt and Road \u2014 through initiatives such as the BRI International Green Development Coalition and its 2021 pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad \u2014 signals a positive turn. But implementation remains uneven. Some countries still see a mix of fossil and renewable investments, and many struggle to ensure environmental compliance.

As signatories to the Paris Agreement, China and the European Union have consistently committed to emissions reduction and are key players in the global fight against climate change. Today, addressing climate change is a consensus not only between China and the EU but also across the international community. Promoting green transformation and energy transition is the only path forward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the years, China has steadily advanced its green transformation by laying out comprehensive strategies across policy, technology, industry, and consumption. China has become an indispensable force in the global shift toward sustainability. In particular, under the intense waves of global technological revolution and competition, China's new energy sector has flourished, demonstrating genuine capabilities. China has emerged as a major global manufacturer of wind power, photovoltaics, and new energy vehicles, with products exported around the world. As China's industrial technology evolves, Chinese enterprises are increasingly expanding overseas. Electric vehicles and battery industries have become new hot spots for Chinese investment in Europe, further strengthening cooperation and injecting powerful momentum into Sino-European green and low-carbon collaboration.</p><p>Thanks to favorable geographic locations and friendly foreign investment policies, Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries like Hungary and Slovakia have become testing grounds and strategic footholds for Chinese new energy companies entering Europe. The cooperation models between China and these countries have evolved from simple trade to encompassing research and development, industrial investment, and standards-setting. This has significantly boosted bilateral cooperation in electric vehicles, photovoltaics and energy storage.</p><p>In recent years, China's leading new energy companies \u2014 CATL, BYD, and EVE Energy \u2014 have invested in Hungary, with total investments reaching \u20ac17 billion ($19.89 billion). CATL alone plans to invest \u20ac7.34 billion ($8.59 billion) to build a factory in Hungary, which is expected to become the largest power battery plant in Europe, supplying major automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen. The projects of CATL, FiberHome, EVE Energy, and Huayou Cobalt in Hungary span from battery production and components manufacturing to complete vehicle assembly, forming a comprehensive electric vehicle industry cluster. This not only enhances Hungary's electric vehicle supply chain but also strengthens its position within the European industrial network and supports its economic development and industrial transformation. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that thanks to deep participation by Chinese EV companies, Hungary is set to become the world's second-largest producer of electric vehicles.</p><p>Cooperation between China and Slovakia in the new energy sector also exemplifies Sino-European green development. By leveraging complementary strengths in clean energy technology, industry, and markets, the two countries have achieved fruitful cooperation in photovoltaics and electric vehicles. In 2024, during Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's visit to China, the two sides signed a joint statement on a strategic partnership, emphasizing strong cooperation in new materials, new infrastructure, clean energy, and sustainable development. China's Gotion High-Tech has signed an investment agreement with Slovakia's Ministry of Economy to build a \u20ac1.23 billion ($1.44 billion) EV battery factory \u2014 set to become the second-largest investment project in Slovakia's history. The project is expected to attract a series of upstream and downstream EV-related manufacturers to Slovakia. Additionally, Volvo, owned by China's Geely Group, has established its third European manufacturing plant in Slovakia, which will localize the mass production of pure electric vehicles.</p><p>Beyond economic benefits, Chinese investment in new energy also improves livelihoods in host countries, creating jobs, raising incomes, and upgrading energy infrastructure. In Hungary, CATL, BYD, Nio, and other companies have already created over 30,000 jobs in the local new energy sector, and this number is expected to grow. These Chinese companies bring advanced EV technologies, manufacturing expertise, and management practices to local firms, enhancing their productivity and operational standards. Through technical training and university-industry collaboration, they also help cultivate local talent in green technologies, laying a solid foundation for long-term industrial upgrading in CEE countries.</p><p>Sino-CEE cooperation in new energy arises from shared development needs and thrives on complementary industrial strengths. These vivid examples demonstrate that green cooperation with China not only accelerates energy transitions in Central and Eastern Europe but also fosters a mutually beneficial model linking Chinese technology with the European market. Together, they have built a solid bridge for Sino-European green development.</p><p>In December 2019, the EU launched the European Green Deal to make Europe the first \"climate-neutral\" continent through systemic policy frameworks. This strategy serves as both a roadmap for Europe's green transition and a global benchmark for sustainable development. With the increasing alignment between the EU Green Deal and China's carbon targets, the potential for cooperation in renewable energy innovation, carbon markets, and green infrastructure is being rapidly unlocked, ushering Sino-European green cooperation into a new phase.</p><p>At this pivotal moment in human civilization, green development cooperation between China and Europe is not only about the transformation of two major economies \u2014 it carries the global mission of tackling climate change. From the Alps to the Yangtze River Delta, countless stories of sustainable progress are unfolding. These stories demonstrate that when Eastern wisdom meets Western experience, and Chinese speed combines with European quality, there could be a transformative force for the world.</p><p>Looking ahead, there is every reason to believe that China and Europe will continue to join hands to build a cleaner, more beautiful planet through green cooperation and leave a sustainable and valuable legacy for future generations.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202507/22/687f5557a310ad07ab7dcd0a.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202507/22/687f5557a310ad07ab7dcd0a.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["In December 2019, the EU launched the European Green Deal to make Europe the first \"climate-neutral\" continent through systemic policy frameworks.

The European Green Deal (2019) sets out the European Commission's explicit goal of establishing Europe as the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Despite current geopolitical complexities impeding progress, the European Union's commitment to this vital transformation remains unwavering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The path to a green transition presents greater challenges for Central and Eastern European countries compared with their Western European counterparts. The foremost obstacle is the scale of investment required, which is particularly challenging given the region's significantly lower economic and income levels. As of the end of 2023, Slovenia, the wealthiest CEEC nation, reached only 74.3 percent of the EU's average in per capita GDP, and five other CEEC members recorded even below 50 percent, reflecting a persistent gap with Western Europe. Furthermore, CEEC members generally lack the critical green and digital technologies needed for transition, making external cooperation essential to achieve their goals.</p><p>The economic structure of the CEEC region is more heavily loaded toward industry compared with Western Europe. According to the World Bank's World Development Indicators, in 2023, with the exception of Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Bulgaria, the industrial value added of other CEEC members, which are also EU members, exceeded the EU's average. Notably, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland all had industrial value added exceeding 30 percent of their GDP. This industrial prominence means that the EU's climate goals and green transition will have a more pronounced impact on the economies of CEEC members.</p><p>Moreover, CEEC members have a higher dependency on traditional fossil fuels, particularly coal. A study by the European Commission Joint Research Center highlighted that the closure of coal mines and power plants in CEEC members would result in significant job losses that would be difficult to offset with new employment opportunities created by clean energy development and improved energy efficiency.</p><p>Given these challenges, the attitude of CEEC members such as Poland and Hungary toward the green transition is markedly less proactive than that of developed EU member states such as Germany. There is widespread concern among CEEC members that the EU's climate ambitions and the green transition could disrupt their efforts to catch up with Western Europe or even widen the existing gap with Western European states. The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement underscored the imperative for China and the EU \u2014 as leading global powers \u2014 to align strategically and deepen cooperation on green transition. Nevertheless, their partnership confronts notable obstacles, chief among them being a lack of sufficient strategic trust. The EU's formal designation of China as a \"systemic rival\" and its focus on \"de-risking\" have impeded collaborative progress.</p><p>Crucially, China and the EU share far more common interests than differences, particularly in climate action and green transformation \u2014 areas where their stakes are profoundly aligned. Within the China-EU green cooperation framework, China's collaboration with the members of the CEEC in green sectors not only alleviates financial constraints, overcomes technological hurdles and accelerates transition timelines, but also enables these nations to secure competitive positions within Europe's burgeoning green industry chain. This dynamic bridges the development gap with Western Europe while advancing the EU's broader integration agenda.</p><p>Since the establishment of the China-CEEC cooperation mechanism in 2012, green collaboration has emerged as a central growth driver within the partnership. Renewable energy and the new energy vehicle industry chain constitute the two primary pillars of this green cooperation. Driven by European climate goals, CEEC members have set ambitious renewable energy targets for 2030, generating substantial demand. Bilateral cooperation in renewable energy focuses primarily on engineering and construction projects, with significant growth in joint investments within wind and solar power sectors in recent years.</p><p>To date, China has successfully delivered multiple renewable energy projects, including wind, hydro and solar power plants and waste-to-energy facilities in CEEC members such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece and Hungary. These projects have not only effectively addressed local electricity shortages and accelerated energy structure upgrades but also boosted employment and economic growth, receiving broad recognition from local communities.</p><p>Cooperation in the new energy vehicle industry chain stands as a defining feature of China-CEEC collaboration. Notably, it became the largest sector for Chinese investment in Europe, absorbing 69 percent of all Chinese capital flows into Europe in 2023. This shift has propelled Hungary to surpass Germany as Europe's top destination for Chinese investment since 2022. Industry giants such as electric vehicle battery provider Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd and EV maker BYD have announced major factory investments in Hungary since 2022, generating significant employment, advancing industrial upgrading, and transforming the country's automotive competitiveness \u2014 demonstrating how green transition challenges can be converted into strategic opportunities.</p><p>Within the realm of green finance, China and CEEC members are actively exploring new cooperative avenues. Moving beyond green credit, they have co-financed green infrastructure projects in the CEEC region via institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Furthermore, the two sides have advanced cooperation in issuing green financial bonds. A landmark event occurred in late 2021 when Hungary successfully issued 1 billion yuan ($139.4 million) in green panda bonds within China's interbank bond market.

The European Green Deal (2019) sets out the European Commission's explicit goal of establishing Europe as the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Despite current geopolitical complexities impeding progress, the European Union's commitment to this vital transformation remains unwavering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The path to a green transition presents greater challenges for Central and Eastern European countries compared with their Western European counterparts. The foremost obstacle is the scale of investment required, which is particularly challenging given the region's significantly lower economic and income levels. As of the end of 2023, Slovenia, the wealthiest CEEC nation, reached only 74.3 percent of the EU's average in per capita GDP, and five other CEEC members recorded even below 50 percent, reflecting a persistent gap with Western Europe. Furthermore, CEEC members generally lack the critical green and digital technologies needed for transition, making external cooperation essential to achieve their goals.</p><p>The economic structure of the CEEC region is more heavily loaded toward industry compared with Western Europe. According to the World Bank's World Development Indicators, in 2023, with the exception of Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Bulgaria, the industrial value added of other CEEC members, which are also EU members, exceeded the EU's average. Notably, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland all had industrial value added exceeding 30 percent of their GDP. This industrial prominence means that the EU's climate goals and green transition will have a more pronounced impact on the economies of CEEC members.</p><p>Moreover, CEEC members have a higher dependency on traditional fossil fuels, particularly coal. A study by the European Commission Joint Research Center highlighted that the closure of coal mines and power plants in CEEC members would result in significant job losses that would be difficult to offset with new employment opportunities created by clean energy development and improved energy efficiency.</p><p>Given these challenges, the attitude of CEEC members such as Poland and Hungary toward the green transition is markedly less proactive than that of developed EU member states such as Germany. There is widespread concern among CEEC members that the EU's climate ambitions and the green transition could disrupt their efforts to catch up with Western Europe or even widen the existing gap with Western European states. The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement underscored the imperative for China and the EU \u2014 as leading global powers \u2014 to align strategically and deepen cooperation on green transition. Nevertheless, their partnership confronts notable obstacles, chief among them being a lack of sufficient strategic trust. The EU's formal designation of China as a \"systemic rival\" and its focus on \"de-risking\" have impeded collaborative progress.</p><p>Crucially, China and the EU share far more common interests than differences, particularly in climate action and green transformation \u2014 areas where their stakes are profoundly aligned. Within the China-EU green cooperation framework, China's collaboration with the members of the CEEC in green sectors not only alleviates financial constraints, overcomes technological hurdles and accelerates transition timelines, but also enables these nations to secure competitive positions within Europe's burgeoning green industry chain. This dynamic bridges the development gap with Western Europe while advancing the EU's broader integration agenda.</p><p>Since the establishment of the China-CEEC cooperation mechanism in 2012, green collaboration has emerged as a central growth driver within the partnership. Renewable energy and the new energy vehicle industry chain constitute the two primary pillars of this green cooperation.

Founded in 2015, AIIB has grown from 57 founding members to 110 across six continents, covering 81 percent of the world's population and 65 percent of global GDP. Over the past decade, it has approved over 60 billion U.S. dollars in financing for 320 projects, leveraging more than 200 billion U.S. dollars in infrastructure investment. From electrifying rural Bangladesh to building roads in Cote d'Ivoire, AIIB-supported projects are narrowing infrastructure gaps and improving lives across continents. </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSFORMING LIVES In Padmo Para village near Dhaka, Bangladesh, local resident Najma Aktar recalls a time when her family studied by the light of a kerosene lamp. That changed in 2016, when the AIIB provided a 165 million U.S. dollar loan to upgrade the local power grid. As the bank's first standalone financed investment, it brought electricity to 12.5 million rural residents, transforming their daily lives. By the end of 2024, AIIB has supported over 51,000 kilometers of transport infrastructure -- enough to circle the Earth more than once -- and benefited more than 410 million people. In Indonesia, AIIB supported the upgrading of urban slums, improving the lives of nearly 10 million people. In China's Yunnan Province, airport expansion enhanced flower exports and boosted farmers' incomes by 25 percent. In Uzbekistan, AIIB helped extend access to clean water for 660,000 residents. \"AIIB's concrete actions have effectively helped bridge global infrastructure investment gaps, advanced regional development, and contributed positively to global economic growth,\" said Lu Feng, professor at Peking University. MULTILATERAL PLATFORM FOR COOPERATION \"AIIB was established on the principles of multilateralism and high international standards,\" the bank's president Jin Liqun told Xinhua in a recent interview, noting that these principles have enabled the bank to earn broad trust and participation across the globe. AIIB's investments span not only Asia but also Africa, Latin America, and beyond, reflecting its commitment to promoting global sustainable development. \"Asia cannot thrive in isolation,\" Jin said, noting that while the bank's primary focus is Asia, its work also supports broader cooperation that contributes to meaningful development outcomes around the world. Reflecting this vision, AIIB has actively expanded its global partnerships and collaborative financing efforts. It is now the largest co-financing partner of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and has built partnerships with over 100 organizations, including multilateral and regional institutions, policy banks, private sector players and philanthropy foundations. On the capital markets side, AIIB had issued over 54 billion U.S. dollars equivalent bonds in multiple currencies as of the end of May, and has consistently maintained triple-A credit ratings from Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch. Moody's, for instance, credited the bank's top rating to its strong financial footing, well-performing assets, and ample liquidity. \"AIIB has become a new model for multilateral cooperation through its innovative operations and collaborative approach,\" said Bai Chong'en, dean of the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University, noting its flexible and pragmatic support for infrastructure development in developing countries. INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TOMORROW Amid rising global challenges, AIIB is positioning itself as a future-oriented development bank that supports both traditional and digital infrastructure for the long haul. In 2020, the bank launched its corporate strategy themed \"Infrastructure for Tomorrow,\" with priorities including green infrastructure, technology-enabled infrastructure, connectivity and cross-border cooperation, and private capital mobilization. By 2025, at least 50 percent of its approved financing was expected to support climate-related projects, a target the bank achieved in 2022, three years ahead of schedule. In Cote d'Ivoire, an AIIB-financed rural road project approved in 2023 has made it easier for villagers to reach hospitals and sell cashews and cocoa, even during flood seasons. Local project coordinator Gilbert Ekpini said residents were thrilled with the changes. By the end of 2024, AIIB-supported projects had added 21.3 gigawatts of installed power generation capacity of renewable energy, helping to reduce nearly 30 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions annually. The bank is increasingly helping its members embrace the digital era. Last year, AIIB launched InfraTech Portal, a digital platform that shares comprehensive, neutral and free information on infrastructure technologies. \"Artificial intelligence holds vast potential and offers developing countries an opportunity to leap ahead in their development,\" Jin said. \"That's why our infrastructure investments must evolve with the times. We should ensure that emerging technologies like AI help narrow, but not widen, the digital divide, especially for the developing world,\" he added.

The locomotives are set to boost green rail transport in Kazakhstan and advance regional connectivity and shared development.</p><p><br/>The collaboration between China and Kazakhstan on new-energy locomotives exemplifies the green development vision of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The success of such clean-energy cooperation projects in recent years highlights how, through the BRI's focus on sustainability, countries can achieve economic development while jointly addressing global climate issues.<br/>The export of China's new-energy locomotives reflects the nation's growing technological strength and industrial competitiveness in the global green transportation sector. The exported locomotives incorporate advanced electric drive systems as well as cutting-edge intelligent and digital technologies, enabling them to meet diverse transport needs. This showcases China's strong international competitiveness in the innovation and industrial upgrading of new-energy transportation.<br/>Moreover, cooperation between China and Kazakhstan in the rail sector has laid a solid foundation for broader bilateral collaboration. Through the joint project, the two countries have gained valuable experience in areas such as technology exchange, talent development, and industrial synergy. The two sides are expected to deepen cooperation in more fields, advancing economic development in both countries.<br/>In recent years, the BRI has made significant strides in green development, with deepening international cooperation mechanisms. China has developed a number of flagship clean-energy projects in BRI countries. For instance, the Al Dhafra solar power station in the United Arab Emirates, the world's largest single-site solar plant built by China Machinery Engineering Corporation, has officially started operations and is expected to cut carbon emissions by 2.4 million tons annually. In another example, China's Universal Energy signed a power purchase agreement for a 500mW wind power project with Uzbekistan.<br/>China and BRI partner countries have launched joint research and development and cooperation on clean and smart technologies in frontier areas such as hydrogen energy, new-energy storage systems, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage, helping address local energy issues.<br/>The joint construction of a green silk road focuses on promoting green infrastructure, investment, and finance. Many regions along the BRI possess world-class solar and wind resources and hold tremendous potential for renewable energy development. However, they are often constrained by limited funding and underdeveloped infrastructure. BRI projects play a vital role in bridging these gaps by offering critical financial support, technical expertise, and professional project management. This collaborative approach fosters mutually beneficial outcomes and drives sustainable economic growth in participating regions.<br/>These projects not only provide stable, clean energy to local communities but also drive economic growth, create jobs, and support the green transformation of regional energy structures, fully demonstrating the BRI's vital role in advancing global green development. According to the International Energy Agency's forecast, by 2040, the annual average new installed capacity in the regions along the BRI will exceed 80 million kilowatts, making it the fastest-growing region for global electricity generation.<br/>The BRI's green development initiative has achieved significant progress across policy, technology, project implementation, and financing, making important contributions to global sustainable development. China's BRI has garnered positive recognition for its emphasis on green development.<br/>Looking ahead, the BRI's focus on green development is anticipated to deepen. In October 2024, the third Belt and Road Energy Ministerial Conference released the Belt and Road Green Energy Cooperation Action Plan (2024-29), which outlined key areas of collaboration, including enhancing green energy security, advancing policy and institutional innovation, and promoting technological cooperation.<br/>As part of this effort, China will continue to deepen green cooperation with BRI partner countries, further implementing the green development vision, and contributing to the construction of a harmonious and sustainable Earth where humanity and nature coexist.

According to news reporting originating from Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Scalar transport is one of the most concerned issues in the urban environment (e.g., pollutants, pollens, and aeolian transport). Vegetations are commonly regarded as scalar-moderation structures in urban areas by influencing airflows, avoiding aeolian erosion and pollution.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Hong Kong (HK) Research Grants Council (RGC) RGC Collaborative Research Fund (CRF), RGC General Research Fund (GRF). <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Hong Kong, \"The morphological multi-scale branch structures of the single tree were usually neglected in previous studies, which, however, can lead to highly inhomogeneous wake. The turbulence generation through the multi-scale branches is not yet clear. The corresponding spatial details of scalar distribution and its mechanism need to be further examined. In this study, the wake after a single fractal tree is investigated using the large-eddy simulation (LES). The spatial characteristics of the wakes are illustrated, indicating susceptible zones in the canopy, first-generation levels of branches, and recirculation regions. Higher-order moments signify the rare, extreme events with strong upward acceleration, removing air masses likely to occur at the canopy shear layer within 3h downstream where h is the characteristic tree height. The quadrant analysis elucidates the scalar transport potential. The scalar distribution and its transport mechanism are visualized, showing dilution and accumulation by the streamwise and vertical velocities.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Involving the multi-scale geometries of the tree can provide guidance for urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning, advancing environmental and sustainability development.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Scalar Transport After a High-resolution Solitary Fractal Tree Based On Large-eddy Simulation: Implication To Urban Green Infrastructure.

The results showed that (1) the development level of UGI in the Yangtze River Delta region decreases from southeast to northwest, and gradually decreases from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other central cities. (2) There were several different configurations of high levels and non-high levels of UGI development drivers across regions, confirming the existence of multiple causality and asymmetry indices in the drivers of UGI.

Subsequently, they assist in monitoring the greening and landscape works of consultants and contractors during project implementation.</p><p>In addition, some landscape architects take on project management roles, co-ordinating various types of projects such as public open spaces and government buildings, overseeing project planning, construction, environmental compliance, cost control, and monitoring progress and quality. Landscape architects also provide professional advice in vetting assessment reports related to landscape and visual impacts under the Town Planning Ordinance and the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance.</p><p>(2) During the consultant selection process for public works projects, the Government follows the guidelines set out in the Architectural and Associated Consultants Selection Board Handbook or the Engineering and Associated Consultants Selection Board Handbook to ensure value for money, while maintaining open and fair competition. The Government's List of Consultants of the Architectural and Associated Consultants Selection Board includes a Landscape Architectural category. Eligible landscape architectural consultants are invited to bid independently as lead consultants for design and research projects related to greening and landscape, such as formulation of greening master plans, public open spaces designs, the Street Tree Selection Guide, the Guidelines on Soil Improvement, and similar initiatives. Departments will invite respective consultants from relevant categories to bid based on the project's overall nature and practical requirements.</p><p>(3) The Government has consistently strived to enhance liveability through various initiatives with the aim to build a liveable, sustainable and inclusive Hong Kong. The Hong Kong 2030+ outlines long-term strategies for green spaces, so as to strengthen blue-green infrastructure, and integrate such elements into both new and existing development areas. Through practice notes, technical circulars, etc, the Government promotes sustainable green building designs in both public and private developments, requiring 20 per cent to 30 per cent green coverage and the provision of public open spaces in private developments, etc. The professional expertise of landscape architects plays a crucial role in implementing these greening policies and measures.</p><p>Landscape architects in the Government play a key role in greening and landscape matters, in particular after the establishment of the Greening and Landscape Office under the Development Bureau (DEVB) in 2010. Landscape architects of the office are responsible for the central co-ordination of the Government's greening and landscape planning and design efforts. Landscape architect posts in various departments have gradually increased to meet the increasingly complex project requirements. For example, landscape architect posts were introduced to the DEVB's Harbour Office to advance waterfront open space projects, and to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to enhance public play spaces. The number of landscape architects managed by the DEVB has increased from about 60 to about 100, and three directorate posts at the rank of Chief Landscape Architect were created in 2017 and 2018. These measures demonstrate the importance that the Government attaches to the landscape architectural profession. To further strengthen the team's capabilities, we also provide systematic training for landscape architects, covering professional knowledge, project management, and innovative technologies. This continuous professional development supports Hong Kong's transformation into a sustainable and liveable city.</p><p>Furthermore, the Government maintains close collaboration with the landscape architectural industry and stakeholders, including the Hong Kong Institute of Landscape Architects and the Association of Landscape Consultants Hong Kong through meetings, and inviting practitioners from the landscape industry to join relevant committees (such as the Urban Forestry Advisory Panel, the Arboriculture and Horticulture Industry Development Advisory Committee, the Harbourfront Commission, etc) to gather professional opinions and facilitate exchange. To further advance the development of the landscape architectural profession, we will explore with relevant departments and encourage greater involvement of landscape architectural consultants in greening and public open space projects, while maintaining ongoing communication with various professional teams and stakeholders.</p><p>[Category: Engineering and Construction, Construction and Materials, Regulatory and Legal]</p><p>Source: Hong Kong SAR Government</p>", "publisher": "Hong Kong Government News", "instances": ["Departments will invite respective consultants from relevant categories to bid based on the project's overall nature and practical requirements.

It is a great pleasure to join you today at the inaugural International Conference on Roads and Railways - a timely and important gathering that brings together a distinguished community of policymakers, engineers, academics and industry leaders to explore the future of connectivity and sustainable mobility.</p><p>To our guests from the Mainland and overseas, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.</p><p>The future of roads and railways</p><p>Roads and railways have long been the backbone of economic growth and social advancement. They are more than just physical infrastructure; they are public goods that connect people, expand opportunities, foster mutual understanding, and enable more inclusive development.</p><p>In an era of rapid technological advancement and growing climate urgency, we are called not only to build infrastructure, but to build it smarter and greener. Transportation systems must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in ways that align with the sustainable development goals and meet the needs of future generations.</p><p>Around the world, the momentum towards smart and sustainable mobility is accelerating. Emerging technologies, from artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to automation and digital twin systems, are transforming how we plan and manage transport infrastructure. These innovations are helping us optimise construction engineering, enable real-time traffic management, and apply AI-powered predictive maintenance that cuts costs, reduces downtime and enhances safety.</p><p>In short, we are seeing a profound shift from traditional infrastructure to intelligent assets that adapt, learn and improve over time.</p><p>At the same time, the global push for decarbonisation is reshaping the transport landscape, calling for action on multiple fronts such as using low-carbon materials in construction; designing infrastructure to support green logistics; and investing in EV charging networks as critical enablers of clean transport. It also means leveraging smart technologies, such as optimising energy consumption through AI, sensor-based monitoring, modular construction, and more, to reduce emissions across the life cycle of transport assets.</p><p>Green infrastructure, once a goal, is now a necessity.</p><p>A key strategy in this transition is transit-oriented development, or TOD, which is a planning approach that integrates high-density urban development with efficient public transport systems. It clusters housing, commercial services and amenities around transit hubs, reducing reliance on private vehicles and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Studies show that well-executed TOD can reduce urban carbon emissions by up to 25 per cent, while also enhancing liveability, walkability and economic vitality. In essence, TOD is about building communities that are compact, connected and carbon-conscious.</p><p>Hong Kong's experience</p><p>So where does Hong Kong stand in all these - and how can we contribute? I believe there are several areas that Hong Kong can share experience with our peers.</p><p>First, technological expertise and professional excellence. Hong Kong's pathway in transport infrastructure is built on advanced engineering know-how, precision planning, and a commitment to innovation. Mable, our Secretary for Transport and Logistics, will soon provide a detailed account of how we are taking the projects forwards and how we are applying advanced technologies. But allow me to highlight a few unique features of our experience.</p><p>Hong Kong is a compact and high-density city, where land is scarce and infrastructure must coexist with tight urban spaces. This has made us a pioneer in TOD, with railways serving as the backbone of urban development. Our railway-led planning integrates transport, housing and commercial uses to create seamlessly connected and lower-emission communities.</p><p>A good example is the Northern Metropolis, envisioned as a major innovation and technology hub. With a projected population of 2.5 million and over 650 000 new jobs, its development will be \"infrastructure-led\" and \"capacity-creating\" - with key projects such as the Northern Metropolis Highway and the Northern Link driving connectivity and growth in the region.</p><p>Given our dense built environment, careful planning and community engagement are essential to avoid undue disruption. While this can be time-consuming, it reminds us of the need to build infrastructure that is responsive to public aspirations and socially inclusive.</p><p>Cross-boundary land transport infrastructure is a defining characteristic of Hong Kong. We have nine land boundary control points. From the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to the High Speed Rail, we have experience in integrating different engineering standards, operational models and even legal frameworks. A good example is the co-location of Mainland's and Hong Kong's customs, immigration and quarantine facilities at the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station. These projects require a high degree of agility, co-ordination with our counterparts and innovation.</p><p>Second, smart and green innovation. Hong Kong is committed to making our transport systems smarter and greener, both as an innovator of new technologies and a user of cutting-edge solutions.</p><p>On the innovation side, we are investing heavily in four key technology areas: AI and robotics, biotech, fintech, and new energy and materials. Our goal is to become an international innovation and technology hub, with AI at its core.</p><p>We already have a vibrant ecosystem of some 4 700 start-ups. In addition, we have been making good progress in attracting strategic enterprises to establish their presence, including R&amp;D centres, here in Hong Kong. These include companies engaged in EVs, autonomous driving, smart traffic management and green materials, many of which are eager to seek global partners to expand their applications.</p><p>On the application side, our high-density urban environment demands the use of advanced technologies to maintain efficiency and reliability of the transportation system. The opportunities in this space are vast, and we warmly welcome tech innovators from around the world to share solutions, co-create new applications, and shape the future of mobility together.</p><p>Finally, financing the future. Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre gives us a unique and powerful lever to support infrastructure development globally.</p><p>With a full suite of funding options, Hong Kong is where infrastructure projects from around the world can raise funds. This is particularly relevant for green, low-carbon infrastructure projects. We are Asia's leading green bond market, accounting for nearly half of the region's total issuance.</p><p>And we are also pioneering innovative financing models to unlock capital for infrastructure development. One such example is securitisation of infrastructure loans, a mechanism that transforms mature, revenue-generating brownfield assets into investment products, thereby freeing up capital for new greenfield projects. To date, Hong Kong has issued two such tranches, totalling US$800 million, supporting over 50 projects across the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.</p><p>In regions where infrastructure funding gap remains urgent and significant - particularly in the Global South - Hong Kong offers practical and scalable ways to accelerate the delivery of essential and sustainable transport networks.</p><p>Concluding remarks</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, I believe the path to smarter and greener mobility is full of potential - and it is through collaboration, innovation and shared commitment that we will realise it.</p><p>On this note, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Highways Department, and the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation for organising this meaningful conference.</p><p>I wish the conference every success, and I look forward to the ideas and partnerships that will emerge from these three exciting days. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Category: Transportation Infrastructure, Highways and Railtracks, Events]</p><p>Source: Hong Kong SAR Government</p>", "publisher": "Hong Kong Government News", "instances": ["At the same time, the global push for decarbonisation is reshaping the transport landscape, calling for action on multiple fronts such as using low-carbon materials in construction; designing infrastructure to support green logistics; and investing in EV charging networks as critical enablers of clean transport.

Ltd issued the following news release:</p><p>In recent years, the country has attached great importance to urban ecological civilization construction, and has built a series of policy frameworks and issued relevant action guidelines, pointing out the direction for urban ecological development. This project is an active implementation of the country's strategic deployment, and its ecological benefits are highly consistent with the country's policy orientation. During the project planning and design process, Shijiazhuang Municipal Design Research Institute, a subsidiary of Suikokai, deeply implemented and implemented the \"Healthy China 2030\" Planning Outline issued by the State Council and the notification requirements for the whole people's fitness plan, adhering to the design principles of \"ecological priority, demand-oriented, and all-domain connectivity\", and firmly adhering to the low-intervention design philosophy of \"minimum human footprint\".</p><p>In terms of route selection, the existing natural terrain was fully utilized to minimize the development footprint, and a three-dimensional route selection mode was adopted, combining GIS big data, on-site investigation, and public participation, with low-altitude aerial photography and three-dimensional modeling technology for real-time correction of line shapes; in terms of vegetation selection, the \"soil-nourishing green\" approach was adopted, prioritizing the use of local vegetation to enhance ecological stability; through vegetation buffer zones, natural separation of functional areas was achieved, and the maximum reduction of disturbance to natural ecology was achieved, allowing citizens to appreciate the ecological corridor of Shijiazhuang's \"mountains, rivers, lakes, and cities\". The project is 101 kilometers long, making it the longest urban greenway in the country, and a model for the organic combination of national urban ecological policy and local ecological foundation. Through the construction of urban green infrastructure, the maximum ecological benefits were achieved, and valuable experience was provided for other cities.</p><p>The greenway network activates the city's \"all-domain landscape corridor\". The Shijiazhuang Ring Road is not only an ecological corridor, but also a key link that activates local landscape resources and connects the park system. The project adopts the innovative design concept of \"stringing pearls into a chain\", deeply integrating the city's scenic beauty along the greenway, awakening dormant scenic nodes, and building a complete and vibrant ecological cultural network.</p><p>Walking along the greenway, each route offers a unique landscape experience. The northern route allows you to appreciate the blooming flowers of the Hutuo River, the Hutuo flower fields, the Xiaoyue Lake wetland, the River and Lake Square, the Jiyin Tower, the Music Fountain, the Grassland Music Valley, the Bird Watching Platform, the Lianxiu Tower, the Yingxiu Mountain Park, the Mingxiu Lake Park, and the Diyun Mountain Park, with a grand and open mountain-water landscape. At the same time, you can appreciate the beautiful city skyline of Zhengding Ancient City and New City.</p><p>The western route allows you to appreciate the vast rural landscape scenery belt, the beautiful sunset of the West Mountain, and the connected scenic spots of the Ten-Li Flower Corridor, the Botanical Garden, the Zoo, the Shuishui Park, and the Cuiping Wetland Park. The southern route greenway seamlessly connects with the city park landscape, with the Tianshan Park, the Bose Park, the Victory Park, the Gaoqian Park, and the Loudi Park, forming a \"10-minute park circle\". The eastern route presents the construction style of the provincial capital city, with high-rise buildings and modern facilities, allowing you to feel the vibrant vitality of urban development.</p><p>The project has become an important carrier for citizens to get close to nature and embrace a healthy life. In the design process, the project team has always put the citizens' expectations for high-quality urban public spaces and healthy lives at the top of the agenda. To improve the accessibility of the greenway, the team has comprehensively optimized the greenway connection system, added a large number of shared bicycle parking lots, and introduced electric connection vehicles, allowing citizens to easily access the greenway and embark on a journey to get close to nature.</p><p>The design fully considers the characteristics of all-age fitness, laying professional permeable asphalt running tracks and cycling paths, providing suitable exercise spaces for running, cycling, elderly fitness, morning exercise, and youth physical training, greatly improving the convenience of exercise. During the May 1st period this year, the 2025 Shijiazhuang First Ring Road Cycling Festival was grandly opened, attracting 1800 cyclists from all over the country to gather together. The cyclists rode along the Ring Road, enjoying the city's ecological scenery while sharing the fruits of ecological construction, and conveying the concept of \"green travel and healthy life\" through practical actions, creating a strong green and healthy atmosphere in the city.</p><p>Since the Ring Road was fully connected, it has not only become the citizens' \"city reception room\" to get close to nature, but also injected new vitality and momentum into the city's development in a unique way, promoting the harmonious coexistence of urban ecology and humanism, improving the city's quality and image, and becoming a bright business card for Shijiazhuang's urban development. The project team relies on the cross-disciplinary team's collaborative cooperation, using engineering construction to overcome numerous difficulties, and successfully achieving the organic balance of engineering construction and natural protection. With outstanding technical integration capabilities and ingenious design ideas, the team has created a new IP growth pole for the city, driving the city to move towards a higher quality development stage.</p><p>In the greenway design, intelligent lamp posts serve as the important carriers of greenway intelligence, integrating multiple functional modules such as intelligent lighting, environmental monitoring, one-key emergency call, and safety monitoring. Intelligent lighting can automatically adjust brightness according to environmental light, achieving energy saving and consumption reduction; environmental monitoring can monitor air quality, temperature, and humidity in real-time, providing healthy travel references for tourists; one-key emergency call provides a convenient assistance channel for tourists in emergency situations; safety monitoring can comprehensively ensure the safety of tourists' person and property. At the same time, the project team has also created intelligent running tracks, using AI intelligent recognition technology to automatically collect user gait, heart rate, and speed data, and setting up beauty cameras to record beautiful moments.</p><p>Each project is a crystallization of the designer's wisdom and craftsmanship, reinterpreting the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature, tradition and modernity, and cities and countryside in a unique way. Suikokai has demonstrated its strong innovative strength and technical foundation through its multi-modal knowledge fusion system and systematic technical breakthrough matrix, vividly realizing the citizens' aspirations for a better life and the city's beautiful transformation. On the road ahead, we have never stopped our footsteps of exploration, always maintaining our passion for innovation and pursuit of excellence, and looking forward to drawing a more vibrant blueprint for the city's future development and creating a more beautiful tomorrow.</p><p>Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated</p><p>[Category: Transportation Infrastructure, Highways and Railtracks, ESG]</p><p>Source: JSTI Group Co.

The China-EU green partnership exemplifies the institutional synergy between China's ecological civilization vision and the European Green Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2010, the High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue between China and the EU has facilitated the exchange of green urban governance experiences. In 2020, the establishment of the China-EU Green Partnership officially incorporated green transition into the core of the comprehensive strategic partnership. Over the years, the EU has taken a lead in addressing climate change and promoting clean energy transitions, being the first economy to propose the 2050 climate neutrality target and the European Green Deal. It has established a comprehensive green policy framework encompassing legislation, regulation, incentives and market mechanisms.</p><p>China, on the other hand, has incorporated its \"carbon peaking and carbon neutrality\" goals into its Nationally Determined Contributions, by setting clear target timelines, launching a national carbon market and expanding its green and low-carbon policy toolkit. While each side pursues green development through its own institutional pathway, they share policy momentum and offer a mutually reinforcing institutional foundation for cooperation.</p><p>China and the EU have also developed a multitiered and full-spectrum framework for green cooperation. Mechanisms continue to function as key platforms for policy exchange in areas including emissions reduction pathways, carbon market rules, green taxation and standard-setting. Through policy communication platform building and technological alignment, China and the EU have effectively shared climate governance experiences and institutional resources, significantly enhancing the policy coordination underpinning their green partnership.</p><p>China and the EU have long maintained a high degree of complementarity within the green industrial system, a structural advantage that forms a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation. In the fields of clean energy and low-carbon technologies, China has built a highly integrated green manufacturing chain, achieving clustered strengths in photovoltaic, wind power, hydrogen energy, electric vehicles and their core components, as well as battery energy storage systems. It possesses large-scale production capacity, rapid cost reduction capabilities, and a globally integrated supply network. The EU, in turn, holds global leadership in green infrastructure, smart grids, energy-efficient buildings, high-end equipment manufacturing and the development of low-carbon technology standards. This complementarity serves as a key starting point for the deepening of cooperation.</p><p>In January, global temperatures hit a record high, highlighting the unprecedented climate crisis faced by countries worldwide in pursuit of the 1.5 C target. However, the absence of global climate leadership, particularly from the United States, poses significant challenges to international climate governance. The energy and socioeconomic crisis triggered by the Ukraine crisis has not only exacerbated the severity of the climate crisis but has also reinforced the critical importance of clean electricity for energy security and national security.</p><p>In response to challenges related to energy security, supply chain restructuring and external uncertainties, both sides have placed greater emphasis on establishing long-term, stable partnerships in green manufacturing. China's industrial advantages provide the EU with cost-effective and reliable support for its energy transition and technology deployment, while the EU contributes by advancing Chinese product quality, aligning standards and integrating high value-added technologies through its technical norms and regulatory expertise.</p><p>China-EU cooperation also helps mitigate Europe's energy security concerns. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the EU has faced increasing pressure in restructuring its energy system. China's central position in global green value chains offers the EU access to vital products, technologies and capital. In photovoltaic, batteries and new-energy transportation projects, Chinese enterprises are increasingly participating in the construction of Europe's green industry ecosystem through joint ventures, equipment supply and the introduction of smart manufacturing practices. This embedded supply chain model not only improves the economic efficiency of industrial collaboration but also enhances the systemic resilience of both sides in the face of external shocks.</p><p>However, amid the growing trend of \"over-securitization\" in economic and trade policy, China and the EU face emerging frictions in multilateral cooperation and urgently need key opportunities to rebuild political mutual trust and strengthen alignment and cooperation in the fields of climate and energy. The US' systematic withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and other multilateral environmental mechanisms has increased the international community's expectations for China and the EU to uphold institutional stability and safeguard multilateral climate rules. At the end of 2025, COP30 will be held in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, marking a pivotal moment for sustaining global climate ambition and advancing the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>China and the EU are the two largest renewable energy investors globally, and they are also the two largest trading partners in the world. As super-economies in clean energy, both parties should not only focus on their own industrial interests and international competitive advantages but also not ignore the fact that they are both facing the race to 1.5 C, a race where global climate leadership is key. Rather than adversaries in a zero-sum game, they should position themselves as mutual supporters in a win-win scenario and, most importantly, as allies in the global fight against the climate crisis.</p><p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, which is a crucial year for assessing global climate action. For China and the EU, as key stakeholders in global climate governance, demonstrating ambition in renewable energy development within their NDC targets is essential to achieving the global goal of tripling renewable energy capacity. Looking ahead to COP30, China and the EU are expected to pursue institutional coordination along three key dimensions.</p><p>First, China and the EU should work together on power decarbonization to build energy systems that are clean, reliable and affordable for both. In the first half of 2024, the EU achieved a historic milestone, with renewable energy accounting for 50 percent of its electricity generation. China has already met its target of reaching 1,200 gigawatts of installed wind and solar capacity by 2030 \u2014 six years ahead of schedule. Notably, in 2024, 80.4 percent of China's newly added electricity generation came from renewable sources. This suggests that if China continues its rapid renewable energy expansion, the country's additional electricity demand in 2025 is highly likely to be fully met by renewables. Such progress would create an unprecedented opportunity for China's power sector to peak emissions by 2025. Meanwhile, China and the EU share similar challenges of how to phase out coal power without compromising energy security and how to make their power systems reliable, cleaner and smarter.</p><p>Second, China and the EU could further explore mechanisms for information exchange and methodological collaboration, laying the groundwork for potential third-party carbon credit transactions in the future, as China's national carbon market and the EU Emissions Trading System have shown initial comparability in terms of accounting methodologies, sectoral coverage and quota management.</p><p>Third, the two sides could expand green project cooperation to third-party markets. China and the EU have already initiated joint efforts in regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. By jointly developing project standards, financial regulations and environmental assessment systems, the two sides are gradually forming a synergistic model of international engagement.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202505/28/6836380aa310ad67bd268127.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Yu Hongyuan</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202505/28/6836380aa310ad67bd268129.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>He Jing</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202505/28/6836380aa310ad67bd26812b.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>LI MIN/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Yu Hongyuan is a professor at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.

The China-EU green partnership exemplifies the institutional synergy between China's ecological civilization vision and the European Green Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2010, the High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue between China and the EU has facilitated the exchange of green urban governance experiences. In 2020, the establishment of the China-EU Green Partnership officially incorporated green transition into the core of the comprehensive strategic partnership. Over the years, the EU has taken a lead in addressing climate change and promoting clean energy transitions, being the first economy to propose the 2050 climate neutrality target and the European Green Deal. It has established a comprehensive green policy framework encompassing legislation, regulation, incentives and market mechanisms.</p><p>China, on the other hand, has incorporated its \"carbon peaking and carbon neutrality\" goals into its Nationally Determined Contributions, by setting clear target timelines, launching a national carbon market and expanding its green and low-carbon policy toolkit. While each side pursues green development through its own institutional pathway, they share policy momentum and offer a mutually reinforcing institutional foundation for cooperation.</p><p>China and the EU have also developed a multitiered and full-spectrum framework for green cooperation. Mechanisms continue to function as key platforms for policy exchange in areas including emissions reduction pathways, carbon market rules, green taxation and standard-setting. Through policy communication platform building and technological alignment, China and the EU have effectively shared climate governance experiences and institutional resources, significantly enhancing the policy coordination underpinning their green partnership.</p><p>China and the EU have long maintained a high degree of complementarity within the green industrial system, a structural advantage that forms a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation. In the fields of clean energy and low-carbon technologies, China has built a highly integrated green manufacturing chain, achieving clustered strengths in photovoltaic, wind power, hydrogen energy, electric vehicles and their core components, as well as battery energy storage systems. It possesses large-scale production capacity, rapid cost reduction capabilities, and a globally integrated supply network. The EU, in turn, holds global leadership in green infrastructure, smart grids, energy-efficient buildings, high-end equipment manufacturing and the development of low-carbon technology standards. This complementarity serves as a key starting point for the deepening of cooperation.</p><p>In January, global temperatures hit a record high, highlighting the unprecedented climate crisis faced by countries worldwide in pursuit of the 1.5 C target. However, the absence of global climate leadership, particularly from the United States, poses significant challenges to international climate governance. The energy and socioeconomic crisis triggered by the Ukraine crisis has not only exacerbated the severity of the climate crisis but has also reinforced the critical importance of clean electricity for energy security and national security.</p><p>In response to challenges related to energy security, supply chain restructuring and external uncertainties, both sides have placed greater emphasis on establishing long-term, stable partnerships in green manufacturing. China's industrial advantages provide the EU with cost-effective and reliable support for its energy transition and technology deployment, while the EU contributes by advancing Chinese product quality, aligning standards and integrating high value-added technologies through its technical norms and regulatory expertise.</p><p>China-EU cooperation also helps mitigate Europe's energy security concerns. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the EU has faced increasing pressure in restructuring its energy system. China's central position in global green value chains offers the EU access to vital products, technologies and capital. In photovoltaic, batteries and new-energy transportation projects, Chinese enterprises are increasingly participating in the construction of Europe's green industry ecosystem through joint ventures, equipment supply and the introduction of smart manufacturing practices. This embedded supply chain model not only improves the economic efficiency of industrial collaboration but also enhances the systemic resilience of both sides in the face of external shocks.</p><p>However, amid the growing trend of \"over-securitization\" in economic and trade policy, China and the EU face emerging frictions in multilateral cooperation and urgently need key opportunities to rebuild political mutual trust and strengthen alignment and cooperation in the fields of climate and energy. The US' systematic withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and other multilateral environmental mechanisms has increased the international community's expectations for China and the EU to uphold institutional stability and safeguard multilateral climate rules. At the end of 2025, COP30 will be held in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, marking a pivotal moment for sustaining global climate ambition and advancing the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>China and the EU are the two largest renewable energy investors globally, and they are also the two largest trading partners in the world. As super-economies in clean energy, both parties should not only focus on their own industrial interests and international competitive advantages but also not ignore the fact that they are both facing the race to 1.5 C, a race where global climate leadership is key. Rather than adversaries in a zero-sum game, they should position themselves as mutual supporters in a win-win scenario and, most importantly, as allies in the global fight against the climate crisis.</p><p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, which is a crucial year for assessing global climate action. For China and the EU, as key stakeholders in global climate governance, demonstrating ambition in renewable energy development within their NDC targets is essential to achieving the global goal of tripling renewable energy capacity. Looking ahead to COP30, China and the EU are expected to pursue institutional coordination along three key dimensions.</p><p>First, China and the EU should work together on power decarbonization to build energy systems that are clean, reliable and affordable for both.

His remarks underscored China's role as a stabilizing force in the global economy and its determination to foster mutual benefit and win-win cooperation in an era of rising protectionism and unilateralism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This commitment to openness stands in stark contrast to the \"America First\" policies pursued by the United States, which have seen it weaponize tariffs and retreat from multilateralism. The US' bullying, unilateral policies have disrupted global trade, finance, and economic stability, creating challenges for nations and businesses worldwide. In this context, China's consistent advocacy for and practice of openness and shared development offer a vital alternative.</p><p>The China Development Forum, attended by hundreds of executives from leading multinational corporations, researchers, officials, and representatives of international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, served as a platform to showcase China's vast opportunities and its commitment to shared development. In his speech, Premier Li urged global business leaders to seize the potential presented by China's massive consumer market, its dynamic innovation ecosystem, and its rapidly growing green economy. He called for international businesses to collaborate with the country in good faith to resist unilateralism and protectionism, emphasizing that mutual benefit and win-win cooperation are the keys to achieving greater development dividends.</p><p>Premier Li's speech also highlighted the indispensable role that foreign-funded enterprises play in upholding China's development trajectory. He described them as key participants and contributors to the country's economic progress, emphasizing that China's doors will remain open to international businesses.</p><p>China's commitment to openness is not merely rhetorical; it is deeply rooted in its institutional design and long-term planning. This year marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), a period during which the country has made significant strides in achieving its economic and social development goals. The success of China's five-year plans over the past seven decades demonstrates the unique advantages of its system, which combines strategic planning with flexibility and adaptability.</p><p>Premier Li's speech highlighted the resilience, potential, and vitality of the Chinese economy. The scale of China's economy, coupled with the efficiency and responsiveness of its policy implementation, generates a powerful endogenous growth impetus. As the Chinese economy continues to strengthen, new growth drivers are emerging across various sectors, from advanced manufacturing and digital technologies to renewable energy and green infrastructure. By integrating into China's market, international businesses can tap into these opportunities. The face-to-face exchanges between international entrepreneurs and China's economic policymakers at the forum provided them with firsthand insights into the government's resolve and capability to maintain long-term stable growth.</p><p>China's commitment to openness is further reinforced by its efforts to address the concerns of foreign companies. Premier Li reiterated that the government will continue to deepen economic system reform, promote the construction of a unified national market, and remove bottlenecks and obstacles to economic circulation, enterprise innovation, and creation. These measures are designed to create a more level playing field for all businesses.</p><p>In a world grappling with uncertainty, China's steady growth and commitment to openness provide a beacon of stability and opportunity. As Premier Li noted, enterprises are not only beneficiaries of globalization they also need to be the defenders and promoters of it.

Amid adjustments to tariff policies on new energy products by major economies, the global new energy supply chain landscape is undergoing profound transformation. Over the past year, our Group had proactively responded to market dynamics by adjusting its strategic positioning, strived to seize new opportunities amid a complicated environment.</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW</p><p>In the past year, substantial progress had been made in our photovoltaic distributed projects in Hong Kong. In the second half of 2024, we completed the acquisitions of rooftop photovoltaic projects located in the western region of the New Territories. The projects successfully generate electricity and be synchronized with the grid, with a cumulative power generation of approximately 201,000 kWh, contributing stable revenue streams for the Group. We anticipate a substantial increase in annual power generation for the entire year of 2026, with corresponding growth in associated revenue.</p><p>NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND STRATEGIC POSITIONING</p><p>Facing domestic market challenges in Mainland China, the Group has proactively expanded its business into overseas markets, with particular focus on Southeast Asia. The region exhibits robust demand for renewable energy and strong policy support, providing expansive growth opportunities for our operations. The Group is currently in active discussions with local partners on renewable energy projects. We are confident that overseas market expansion will bring new revenue streams and growth momentum for the Group.</p><p>For the Hong Kong market, the Group continues to advance its photovoltaic distributed projects and actively participate in the Scheme of Control Agreement (SoCA) promoted by the HKSAR Government. We are committed to contributing to Hong Kong's green, low-carbon transition while also creating value for shareholders.</p><p>On 25 June 2025, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an operation and maintenance services contract with an associated company for the provision of the operation and maintenance services at a photovoltaic power station in Hebei Province for a term of three years. The contract not only demonstrates the Group's technological prowess in the new energy sector but also establishes its strategic direction to diversify its new energy business. Moving forward, the Group will continue to explore similar collaboration opportunities to strengthen its market position in the new energy industry and secure stable revenue streams.</p><p>BUSINESS ADJUSTMENT AND OPTIMIZATION</p><p>In the course of our business development, we have also encountered certain areas requiring strategic adjustments. Regarding the co-operation agreement entered into by Sanmenxia Baike with its project partner, the construction of power plants and distributed photovoltaic power plant was unable to commence as scheduled due to unexpected changes in key personnel. After prudent evaluation, the Group has decided to suspend the co-operation agreement. Despite this setback, we remain committed to exploring new partnership opportunities in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, given the persistent decline in market prices of photovoltaic module, the originally planned commissioning of our module manufacturing plant is now facing significant pressure. To ensure optimal resources deployment and maximize shareholders value, the management team is conducting a prudent evaluation of the feasibility in module manufacturing plan adjustment, including pivoting to more competitive new energy products or exploring alternative development directions. We will keep the market promptly informed of relevant developments if any.</p><p>PROSPECTS</p><p>Looking ahead into 2025, the Group will remain committed to the following strategic directions:</p><p>1. Optimizing Business layout: Adjust production plans flexibly in response to market changes while exploring high-value-added new energy products.</p><p>2. Expanding Overseas IVIarlcets: Advance project implementation in overseas regions to build a global business footprint.</p><p>3. Strengthening Collaboration: Work closely with partners across the value chain to collectively address industry challenges.</p><p>While the road ahead remains uncertain, however, we maintain strong confidence in the long-term development of the new energy industry. The Group will uphold its prudent approach to operations, actively navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and deliver sustainable value for both our shareholders and society.</p><p>Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to our shareholders, customers, partners, and all the employees. Let us advance resolutely through adversity. Together and hand-in-hand, we will move forward to embrace a brighter tomorrow for clean energy!</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 8, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 292 words </p><p>July 01: China Technology Industry: 2025 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT</p><p>Stepping into 2024, the global economy faces various challenges, and in the complex and ever-changing international environment, enterprises need to respond more flexibly to various uncertainties. Nevertheless, climate change remains a focal issue of concern for all countries, with various sectors actively seeking effective solutions to reduce carbon emissions in supply chains and continuing to invest in green infrastructure to enhance long-term resilience. In this period full of both challenges and opportunities, our Group adheres to the concept of green development, making full use of our professional capabilities in the sustainable business field, prudently expanding our business scope while strengthening in-depth cooperation with customers. Sustainable development has become an important component of our corporate core values, guiding our Group's strategic decisions in a volatile environment. Over the past year, management and employees have worked together with one heart, overcoming difficulties together with customers, suppliers, and business partners, establishing more solid cooperative relationships and striving to achieve long-term sustainable development.</p><p>In response to climate change, the Chinese government first proposed the \"carbon neutrality and carbon peak\" (\"dual carbon\" goals) in 2020, with the aim of reaching the peak of carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. This involves gradually transitioning from a high-carbon energy structure and advancing work related to climate change mitigation. To accelerate the construction of a clean, low-carbon, safe, and efficient energy system, the National Energy Administration issued the \"Guiding Opinions on Energy Work in 2024\", which outlines three main development goals. The top priority is \"continuously enhancing supply security capacity\", followed by \"continuous optimization of the energy structure\" and \"steady improvement in quality and efficiency\".</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 8, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 127 words </p><p>July 01: China Technology Industry: ANNUAL RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2025</p><p>The board (\"Board\") of Directors (the \"Directors\") of the China Technology Industry Group Limited (the \"Company\", together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\") is pleased to announce the annual results of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2025.

His remarks underscored China's role as a stabilizing force in the global economy and its determination to foster mutual benefit and win-win cooperation in an era of rising protectionism and unilateralism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This commitment to openness stands in stark contrast to the \"America First\" policies pursued by the United States, which have seen it weaponize tariffs and retreat from multilateralism. The US' bullying, unilateral policies have disrupted global trade, finance, and economic stability, creating challenges for nations and businesses worldwide. In this context, China's consistent advocacy for and practice of openness and shared development offer a vital alternative.</p><p>The China Development Forum, attended by hundreds of executives from leading multinational corporations, researchers, officials, and representatives of international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, served as a platform to showcase China's vast opportunities and its commitment to shared development. In his speech, Premier Li urged global business leaders to seize the potential presented by China's massive consumer market, its dynamic innovation ecosystem, and its rapidly growing green economy. He called for international businesses to collaborate with the country in good faith to resist unilateralism and protectionism, emphasizing that mutual benefit and win-win cooperation are the keys to achieving greater development dividends.</p><p>Premier Li's speech also highlighted the indispensable role that foreign-funded enterprises play in upholding China's development trajectory.

In the face of these challenges, the Group has adhered to the philosophy of sustainable development, proactively responded to changes in the external environment, and continuously strengthened its core competitiveness through prudent operational strategies and optimized resource allocation. For the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group recorded revenue of HK$869.7 million, an increase of 92.3% from the previous financial year; gross profit of HK$102.7 million, up by 266.8% year-on-year; and adjusted annual EBITDA profit of HK$44.8 million, achieving a turnaround from loss to profit. This represents a significant achievement in our business transformation and a solid step forward in the Group's pursuit of green development.</p><p>In addition to acting as the Hong Kong main contractor for superstructure building and repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition works, the Group has vigorously expanded its green business in recent years, particularly in the development of a global power battery recycling system, where its related operations have achieved breakthrough progress. Moving forward, the Group will continue to leverage green business as a driving force to promote efficient resource utilization and low-carbon transformation, steadily creating growing value returns for shareholders while contributing to the establishment of a green industrial ecosystem in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the development of a global circular economy.</p><p>GOING FORWARD</p><p>Global electric vehicle sales have repeatedly hit record highs, driving a simultaneous surge in demand for lithiumion batteries and retired battery processing. Since initiating its transformation in 2023, the Group has adopted the strategic direction of \"anchoring in Hong Kong while expanding globally\" and proactively positioned itself in key areas amid the electrification trend, focusing on developing sustainable solutions for power batteries and other related businesses.</p><p>Rooted in Hong Kong, its subsidiary was officially approved to build \"Hong Kong's First EV Battery Processing Plant\" in June 2024, and construction is currently progressing steadily. Leveraging the Group's extensive technical expertise and comprehensive certifications in battery recycling, the facility will utilize advanced equipment and technology to meet local demand for retired lithiumion battery processing while serving as a hub in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to collaborate with industry partners in expanding a green recycling economy system. The Group is also actively engaged in advancing green infrastructure initiatives. This includes promoting batteries energy storage systems to provide safe, reliable, and low-carbon power solutions for construction sites and commercial and industrial applications; providing infrastructure support for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in communities by complementing the EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme (EHSS) and supporting the development of its EV charging facilities business; additionally, the Group is exploring innovative pathways for retired battery repurposing in energy storage, aiming to establish a closed-loop battery lifecycle management system. These efforts not only strengthen Hong Kong's low-carbon transition but also unlock substantial business growth opportunities for the Group.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Group continues to strengthen its global footprint, establishing over 70 service locations across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, regions with mature electrification markets to build an internationally connected recycling network, providing customers with one-stop green energy management solutions. Key global markets such as Europe have recently introduced new regulations on battery traceability management and recycling, significantly raising industry compliance thresholds. In the future, compliance licenses and professional expertise will become critical intangible assets and core competitive barriers in the sector. With its comprehensive licensing coverage for power battery recycling across major global markets, the Group has established a differentiated competitive advantage in rapidly responding to regional demands, reinforcing its leading position in global business expansion; additionally, its locally embedded operational teams are deeply attuned to regional market characteristics, providing crucial support for technology implementation and service responsiveness. These dual advantages continue to serve as strategic engines for advancing the standardization of global power battery recycling and regeneration chains, delivering strong momentum for the Group's business growth.</p><p>In terms of resource collaboration, the Group also deepened strategic partnerships with leading domestic and overseas industry players, including renowned automakers, core battery suppliers, and energy storage service providers. With the accelerating adoption of commercial electric vehicles, such as electric trucks and electric ferries, coupled with technological breakthroughs and favorable policies, the momentum toward the full electrification of transportation is expected to intensify. This will drive the maturation of the retired battery recycling industry and other energy utilization value chains, presenting vast prospects for future development.</p><p>APPRECIATION</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to all employees for their hard work, shareholders for their continued trust, business partners for their close collaboration, and the broader community for their unwavering support. We will continue to drive growth through innovation, respond to market changes with agility, and deepen our sustainable development strategy centred on renewable energy and low-carbon solutions to deliver steady growth and enhance long-term competitiveness for our shareholders. At the same time, through close collaboration with our partners, we will promote the green transformation of our industries and collaborate with the community to advance towards a net-zero future.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 265 words </p><p>July 29: ENVISION GREENWISE: DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTION IN RELATION TO THE ENTERING INTO OF THE SALES COOPERATION AGREEMENT INVOLVING THE ISSUE OF CONSIDERATION SHARES UNDER GENERAL MANDATE</p><p>SALES COOPERATION AGREEMENT</p><p>On 28 July 2025 (after trading hours), the Company and FMG entered into the Sales Cooperation Agreement, pursuant to which FMG has conditionally agreed to supply the Products exclusively to the Company pursuant to the purchase orders to be placed by the Company, and the Company has agreed to market and sell the Products worldwide (the \"Cooperation\").</p><p>In consideration of the Cooperation, the Company agreed to pay to FMG the total consideration of US$20,000,000.00, which shall be settled by the Company by the issue and allotment of the Consideration Shares at the Issue Price on the Effective Date of the Cooperation.

The US once projected climate leadership through innovation, diplomacy, and commitments.</p><p>After all, the US helped launch the Paris Agreement in 2015 \u2014 together with China \u2014 and ratified it domestically by 2016.

Funding for climate science research has been significantly reduced, leading to the termination of grants for clean-energy projects and the dismissal of scientists from key agencies. Environmental regulations have been rolled back, and incentives for clean-energy initiatives have been withdrawn. Concurrently, fossil fuels are being promoted as instruments of economic nationalism, echoing the \"drill, baby, drill\" mantra, with these combined policies framed as efforts to \"make America great again\".</p><p>This shift is not just domestic policy, as it has global consequences.

And while its clean-energy deployment is impressive, it has not yet signaled a clear timeline for phasing out coal \u2014 the dirtiest fossil fuel.</p><p>So, this is the new climate reality: The US, once the standard-bearer of global climate diplomacy, has stepped back; China is stepping up but must address its coal usage; and while the European Union \u2014 which emits about 8 percent of global emissions \u2014 may be said to lead on climate policy, its efforts are insufficient on its own. The rest of the world is left navigating an unstable global climate order.</p><p>Meanwhile, the climate itself is accelerating. The WMO report details record-high ocean heat, rising sea levels, and shrinking glaciers. In 2024, extreme weather events wreaked havoc across continents with extreme storms. Oceans are not only warming but also acidifying. Entire ecosystems are being thrown into imbalance.</p><p>The core goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit warming to 1.5 C, is slipping out of reach. According to the WMO, three scientific models estimate current warming between 1.34 C and 1.41 C. One more fossil-fueled growth cycle \u2014 as the US is embarking upon \u2014 could lock in overshoot conditions for decades. This happens when international trust is being frayed and geopolitical competition intensifies.</p><p>We can no longer separate climate change from geopolitics.

It was his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in three years.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>The visit\u2014the first by a Western leader to China since the onset of the U.S.' new round of \"reciprocal tariffs\"\u2014carries messages that China, Spain, and other European countries are seeking cooperation and stability, and safeguarding the consensus on economic globalization.<br/><br/><br/><br/>China appreciates the Spanish Government's emphasis on developing relations with China and its continuous promotion of practical cooperation and personnel exchanges between the two countries, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on May 7.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"S\u00e1nchez is the European leader who has visited China the most, and that demonstrates strong Spain-China ties,\" Gerardo Pisarello, First Secretary of the Bureau of the SpanishCongress of Deputies and former Deputy Mayor of Barcelona, said during the 2025 China-Spain Mayors' Dialogue convened in Chongqing Municipality on April 25.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The event, a diplomatic follow-up just days after the leaders' summit, focused on reinforcing bonds in cultural, economic and technological sectors. \"There is a whole future ahead of us, and I think we are in the best position to promote it,\" Pisarello emphasized.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Building trust<br/><br/><br/><br/>Under the theme Sharing Wisdom in Governance to Jointly Build Resilient Cities, 70-plus mayors and representatives from China and Spain met in Chongqing, a Chinese megacity of 34 million inhabitants wedged between mountains and famous for its spicy food, neon-lit skyscrapers and frequent fog. They were to exchange ideas and strengthen bilateral cooperation in areas such as green transition, the digital economy, and innovation in local governance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The event was co-hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and C\u00e1tedra China Foundation, and organized by the Chongqing People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"We live in complex times, marked by instability and uncertainty. Today's geopolitical context demands serenity, mutual respect and openness. Spain and China stand as firm advocates for dialogue, multilateralism and peace,\" Pisarello, who led the Spanish delegation of 16 mayors and municipal councilors, said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"The world is being threatened by new forms of unilateralism,\" Pisarello told Beijing Review, referencing the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs.\" \"In response, China is offering an alternative\u2014the defense of multilateralism, peace and international law. Spain believes in this project.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>The \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed by the U.S. since President Donald Trump returned to the White House early this year have affected both China and Spain. Trump has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods of up to 145 percent, and Beijing has announced countermeasures with levies of 125 percent on some goods from the U.S.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trump's broad tariffs on imports from the European Union have been detrimental to Spain. The U.S. implemented a 20-percent tariff on all EU goods, which it later reduced to 10 percent during a 90-day negotiation window. These measures targeted key Spanish exports, including olive oil, wine and industrial machinery. In response, S\u00e1nchez announced a $16-billion aid package to mitigate the impact.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fernando Morales Rodr\u00edguez, an economist and editor at the C\u00e1tedra China Foundation, called the U.S. approach a mistake. \"It is a mistake that leads nowhere\u2014neither to the U.S. economy, nor the Spanish economy, nor the Chinese economy,\" he told Beijing Review.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Morales Rodr\u00edguez called for collective efforts by nations to \"end this tariff war as soon as possible so that peoples can grow together and mutually benefit.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"We believe that if the U.S. continues the tariffs against everyone, the rest of the world should seek dialogue, cooperation and mutual understanding so that our economies can continue functioning and developing,\" he added.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Morales Rodr\u00edguez stressed this position was reflected in the meeting between S\u00e1nchez and Xi, and that close collaboration is the way forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Indeed, Spain and China have maintained pragmatic relations. Since establishing diplomatic ties in 1973 and elevating their relationship to a strategic partnership in 2005, the two nations have deepened cooperation in trade, tourism, education and innovation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>President Xi's 2018 visit to Spain and S\u00e1nchez's visits to China in 2023 and 2024 all yielded concrete agreements. During Spain's EU Council presidency in the second half of 2023, Madrid promoted stronger EU-China relations\u2014a stance that may now prove pivotal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Signs of a thaw between China and Europe are emerging. China and the European Parliament have decided to simultaneously and comprehensively lift restrictions on mutual exchanges, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said during a press briefing on May 6. Beijing and Brussels have agreed to look into setting minimum prices of Chinese-made electric vehicles instead of the tariffs imposed by the EU last year.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Both Pisarello and Morales Rodr\u00edguez advocated for stronger EU-China relations. \"I think one of Spain's roles is to convince Europe that China must be a partner and an ally in advancing this new multilateralism, one that defends peace and shared prosperity among all peoples,\" Pisarello noted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Municipal cooperation<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prior to the dialogue, Spanish delegates visited Chongqing's Shiyou and Zhongshutuo communities in Jiangbei District, where China's \"grid governance\" model left a deep impression on them. The model establishes \"15-minute living circles,\" which integrate services like senior canteens, youth programs and one-stop administrative hubs within a 15-minute radius, bringing convenience and efficiency to the residents.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Alaitz Zabala, a member of the Basque Autonomous Community Parliament, and Amaiur Guindeo, Councilor of Burlada, a municipality in Navarre Province, lauded China's agility in urban planning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"I saw a huge administrative simplification here, with fast processing. This is surely also the result of a competent, agile and fast public service system,\" Guindeo told Beijing Review. \"And there is a powerful body of civil servants here in China, which makes everything more competent and logically speeds everything up.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>While China has witnessed great transformation due to streamlined bureaucracy, \"In Spain, our laws are too protective and participatory, which slow down progress,\" Zabala told Beijing Review.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Morales Rodr\u00edguez, a first-time visitor to China, expressed similar views, praising China's structured municipal governance. \"Nothing is left to chance here. Urbanization aligns precisely with citizens' needs,\" he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They also identified areas where Spain's expertise could be valuable. Guindeo pointed to Spain's strength in sustainable urban design, citing Barcelona's green infrastructure as a model that has already drawn interest from Chinese cities. Morales Rodr\u00edguez added that Spain's focus on community-driven welfare systems, particularly in elderly and childcare services, could provide valuable insights for China as it navigates its own aging population challenges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>During the roundtable discussions of the dialogue, Juli\u00e1n Nieva, Mayor of Manzanares Municipality, highlighted the value of such meetings in strengthening international relations from a municipal perspective. \"The difference in size isn't the most important thing, because in terms of friendship and respect, China wants to open up to the world, a place where Spain wants to be, increasingly seeking collaboration, cooperation  and understanding between the different towns and cities of both countries,\" he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Marta Montoro, Director of the C\u00e1tedra China Foundation, announced plans to expand the dialogue into an annual event, bringing in more cities and sectors. \"This goes beyond politics\u2014our goal is for mayors to understand the reality of 21st-century China, one that doesn't frequently appear in the media,\" she emphasized.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"I think there are many interests in the West that don't want their citizens to know what China has really been able to develop over the last decades. I believe that Spanish visitors to China will gain a very different, but at the same time, very positive view of China compared to what we usually hear in the West,\" Morales Rodr\u00edguez said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"We must move beyond seeing each other as threats.

This series will take you on a journey of health that goes both ways, from people to nature, to the unique charm of the slow city, the natural benefits of ecological construction, and the happiness and benefits that the state policy brings to people.</p><p>In recent years, the government has been pushing ahead with its Healthy China Diet Strategy, advocating for fitness and green travel for all citizens. Tenkai City has responded to the national call to build a health walkway as an entry point to create a benchmark project for urban renewal, which not only fits the country's deployment of a system of public services to improve the health of all citizens, but also shows the forward-looking layout of urban ecological civilization and the improvement of people' s livelihood. The city of Suzhou has the advantage of providing services along the entire chain, through scientific selection, application of ecological techniques and local cultural implantation, and other means, to integrate ecology, sports and leisure with urban space, promote urban organic renewal, create a functional, artistic and sustainable linear park, provide a replicable solution for the renewing of mountain cities.</p><p>The people's desire to create green spaces for all As the process of urbanization accelerates, the size of cities increases, and the population density increased, so the need for high-quality urban public spaces becomes more urgent.

The increase in total revenue was mainly attributable to the increase from reverse supply chain management and environmental-related service of approximately HK$467.0 million, which was offset by the decrease from superstructure building and RMAA works of approximately HK$49.5 million.</p><p>Press Release article 5 of 20, 863 words </p><p>July 29: Envision Greenwise Holdings : Chairman's Statement</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>Over the past year, the complex changes in the international landscape and the intensive adjustments in economic policies have introduced numerous uncertainties to the global markets. In the face of these challenges, the Group has adhered to the philosophy of sustainable development, proactively responded to changes in the external environment, and continuously strengthened its core competitiveness through prudent operational strategies and optimized resource allocation. For the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group recorded revenue of HK$869.7 million, an increase of 92.3% from the previous financial year; gross profit of HK$102.7 million, up by 266.8% year-on-year; and adjusted annual EBITDA profit of HK$44.8 million, achieving a turnaround from loss to profit. This represents a significant achievement in our business transformation and a solid step forward in the Group's pursuit of green development.</p><p>In addition to acting as the Hong Kong main contractor for superstructure building and repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition works, the Group has vigorously expanded its green business in recent years, particularly in the development of a global power battery recycling system, where its related operations have achieved breakthrough progress. Moving forward, the Group will continue to leverage green business as a driving force to promote efficient resource utilization and low-carbon transformation, steadily creating growing value returns for shareholders while contributing to the establishment of a green industrial ecosystem in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the development of a global circular economy.</p><p>GOING FORWARD</p><p>Global electric vehicle sales have repeatedly hit record highs, driving a simultaneous surge in demand for lithiumion batteries and retired battery processing. Since initiating its transformation in 2023, the Group has adopted the strategic direction of \"anchoring in Hong Kong while expanding globally\" and proactively positioned itself in key areas amid the electrification trend, focusing on developing sustainable solutions for power batteries and other related businesses.</p><p>Rooted in Hong Kong, its subsidiary was officially approved to build \"Hong Kong's First EV Battery Processing Plant\" in June 2024, and construction is currently progressing steadily. Leveraging the Group's extensive technical expertise and comprehensive certifications in battery recycling, the facility will utilize advanced equipment and technology to meet local demand for retired lithiumion battery processing while serving as a hub in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to collaborate with industry partners in expanding a green recycling economy system. The Group is also actively engaged in advancing green infrastructure initiatives. This includes promoting batteries energy storage systems to provide safe, reliable, and low-carbon power solutions for construction sites and commercial and industrial applications; providing infrastructure support for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in communities by complementing the EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme (EHSS) and supporting the development of its EV charging facilities business; additionally, the Group is exploring innovative pathways for retired battery repurposing in energy storage, aiming to establish a closed-loop battery lifecycle management system. These efforts not only strengthen Hong Kong's low-carbon transition but also unlock substantial business growth opportunities for the Group.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Group continues to strengthen its global footprint, establishing over 70 service locations across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, regions with mature electrification markets to build an internationally connected recycling network, providing customers with one-stop green energy management solutions. Key global markets such as Europe have recently introduced new regulations on battery traceability management and recycling, significantly raising industry compliance thresholds. In the future, compliance licenses and professional expertise will become critical intangible assets and core competitive barriers in the sector. With its comprehensive licensing coverage for power battery recycling across major global markets, the Group has established a differentiated competitive advantage in rapidly responding to regional demands, reinforcing its leading position in global business expansion; additionally, its locally embedded operational teams are deeply attuned to regional market characteristics, providing crucial support for technology implementation and service responsiveness. These dual advantages continue to serve as strategic engines for advancing the standardization of global power battery recycling and regeneration chains, delivering strong momentum for the Group's business growth.</p><p>In terms of resource collaboration, the Group also deepened strategic partnerships with leading domestic and overseas industry players, including renowned automakers, core battery suppliers, and energy storage service providers. With the accelerating adoption of commercial electric vehicles, such as electric trucks and electric ferries, coupled with technological breakthroughs and favorable policies, the momentum toward the full electrification of transportation is expected to intensify. This will drive the maturation of the retired battery recycling industry and other energy utilization value chains, presenting vast prospects for future development.</p><p>APPRECIATION</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to all employees for their hard work, shareholders for their continued trust, business partners for their close collaboration, and the broader community for their unwavering support. We will continue to drive growth through innovation, respond to market changes with agility, and deepen our sustainable development strategy centred on renewable energy and low-carbon solutions to deliver steady growth and enhance long-term competitiveness for our shareholders. At the same time, through close collaboration with our partners, we will promote the green transformation of our industries and collaborate with the community to advance towards a net-zero future.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 125 words </p><p>July 24: Envision Greenwise: Monthly Return of Equity Issuer on Movements in Securities</p><p>Monthly Return for Equity Issuer and Hong Kong Depositary Receipts listed under Chapter 19B of the Exchange Listing Rules on Movements in Securities</p><p>I.

Today, it is the world's economic engine, contributing more than half of global growth. But will this success lead to greater cooperation, or will fragmentation define the region's rise? The answer lies in the choices we make today. The Boao Forum for Asia 2025 presented an opportunity to shape those decisions, urging sustainable and inclusive growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indonesia has long played a role in the Boao Forum. In 2005, then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono addressed the forum under the theme \"Asia Searching for Win-Win: The New Role for Asia\". That year marked the establishment of the strategic partnership between Indonesia and China, setting the stage for future collaboration.</p><p>Today, the global landscape is shifting rapidly, with economic realignments, technological breakthroughs, geopolitical tensions, and climate change impacts. Now is the time to think bigger, act faster, and collaborate more deeply.</p><p>Sustainability is more than crisis management; it's about lifting communities out of poverty, safeguarding natural resources, and ensuring long-term prosperity. Resilience may not yield immediate returns, but it lays the foundation for stability.</p><p>Under President Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia is integrating infrastructure, food security, water management and energy sustainability into a unified strategy. These areas are interconnected. No infrastructure is valuable without electricity, clean water or agricultural productivity. Indonesia's initiatives, such as improving irrigation systems and scaling renewable energy, contribute to a resilient economy. In Central Java, improved irrigation has boosted agricultural yields, reducing climate risks.</p><p>No country can tackle sustainable development alone. Climate risk, energy security and food resilience are global challenges that require cooperation. True sustainability can only be achieved through joint action. Three areas stand out: infrastructure connectivity, the clean energy transition and digital transformation.</p><p>Infrastructure connectivity is crucial for trade and investment. Without efficient roads, ports and digital networks, economic growth stagnates. Indonesia advocates for deeper cooperation on cross-border infrastructure to ensure widespread benefits. The Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 offers a framework, while countries such as Vietnam and Thailand highlight how public-private partnerships can accelerate development.</p><p>Building on this regional commitment, Indonesia actively fosters partnerships with key international players to enhance its infrastructure network. A notable example is the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, also known as Whoosh, developed in collaboration with China as part of Indonesia's broader infrastructure strategy. Beyond enhancing connectivity, the project stimulates economic growth along its corridor, generating new opportunities for businesses and local communities.</p><p>Regional cooperation is vital for the clean energy transition. Moving away from fossil fuels presents challenges for emerging economies, but reliance on outdated energy sources is unsustainable. The Asian Development Bank estimates that unchecked climate change could shrink regional GDP by up to 17 percent by 2070. On the other hand, investment in green infrastructure and clean energy could unlock billions of dollars in economic gains and create thousands of jobs. Indonesia, with the world's largest geothermal reserves, is making renewable energy a central part of its strategy.</p><p>Indonesia's energy transition extends beyond geothermal development to the strategic expansion of its battery and electric vehicles ecosystem. A key priority is advancing its nickel downstream industry to maximize domestic value creation and strengthen global competitiveness. To support this vision, Indonesia has engaged international partners, with investment from China playing a significant role in accelerating development. By leveraging its resources, fostering innovation, and driving industrial growth, Indonesia is positioning itself as a major player in the global battery and EV supply chain.</p><p>Digital governance must also be addressed. Artificial intelligence, data and automation are reshaping industries, offering potential to enhance energy efficiency, healthcare and education. But without regulation, these technologies could widen inequalities and create security risks. Indonesia supports the establishment of a global framework for AI governance to ensure technology benefits society while reducing digital divides. Clear regulations and ethical standards are necessary for inclusive growth.</p><p>As global dynamics change, Asia stands at a critical juncture. Will it become a battleground for rivalries, or will it rise as a unified force for stability and progress? Traditional security frameworks that focus on military strength and economic power are no longer sufficient. Long-term resilience now depends on food, water and energy security, as well as defense and diplomacy.</p><p>For decades, the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations has anchored regional stability, guided by the belief that regional challenges require regional solutions. Strengthening ASEAN institutions, advancing security dialogues, and reinforcing multilateral partnerships are key to lasting peace and economic resilience. A connected Asia is not only an engine of growth but also a pillar of geopolitical stability. Through cooperation with diverse partners, including China as a comprehensive strategic partner, ASEAN plays a vital role in promoting inclusive and sustainable growth, ensuring that the benefits are widely shared across the region.</p><p>Regional cooperation faces challenges such as diverging national interests and economic disparities. But the cost of fragmentation is much higher. A more integrated Asia benefits everyone, ensuring collective resilience in an era of uncertainty.</p><p>Sustainable development is no longer just an economic priority; it is a security imperative. Trust, shared responsibility, and inclusive growth must underpin Asia's development agenda. Decisions made today will determine whether the region emerges as a model of unity and innovation or succumbs to division and short-termism.</p><p>The future is not something to wait for; it is something we build together. Governments must commit to bold reforms, businesses must drive sustainable innovation, and regional partnerships must move from rhetoric to results. Only then will Asia's rise be defined by collaboration rather than fragmentation.</p><p>As the Javanese say, Becik ketitik, olo ketoro; good deeds will be seen, and bad deeds will not stay hidden forever. The choices we make will define the world our children inherit.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202504/14/67fc47a7a3101d7ae150f57e.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202504/14/67fc47a7a3101d7ae150f580.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202504/14/67fc47a7a3101d7ae150f582.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>WANG XIAOYING/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The author is coordinating minister for the Infrastructure and Regional Development, Indonesia.

These initiatives highlight VinFast's commitment to accelerating the adoption of green mobility in the country. </p><p><br/><br/>In the Philippines, the VF 6 is available in two trims: Eco and Plus, with MSRPs of 1,419,000 PHP and 1,610,000 PHP respectively. Deliveries of the VF 6 Eco are expected to begin in May 2025. <br/><br/>To further support consumers in confidently embracing a green lifestyle, VinFast is also introducing an attractive buyback program, offering up to 90% of the vehicle's original value. This policy applies across the company's entire product lineup. The company's growing network of showrooms\u2014strategically located across key urban areas\u2014enhances access to electric vehicles. <br/><br/>Developed in collaboration with the renowned studio Torino Design, the VF 6 features a modern design inspired by the concept of \"The Duality in Nature.\" This unique style reflects the vehicle's own spirit and personality, while seamlessly blending with VinFast's distinctive and unmistakable design language. Its overall dimensions (length x width x height) are 4,241 x 1,834 x 1,580 mm, with a wheelbase of 2,730 mm. Thanks to the advantages of EV architecture, this B-segment vehicle offers an interior space comparable to many C-segment gasoline models. <br/><br/>The VF 6 is equipped with a powerful electric motor delivering up to 150 kW and torque of 250 Nm (Eco) or 310 Nm (Plus). With a range of up to 480 km per full charge (NEDC standard), the VF 6 is well suited for the dynamic needs of modern families. It also includes 20 advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) features and 8 airbags, offering added peace of mind\u2014especially for families with young children. <br/><br/>In terms of aftersales service, the VF 6 comes with one of the most competitive warranties in its class: 7 years or 160,000 kilometers, whichever comes first. In addition to services at VinFast showrooms, the company is collaborating with trusted partners such as Motech and JIGA to develop a nationwide network of 100 authorized service centers by the end of 2025. <br/><br/>The Philippines now hosts nearly the full lineup of VinFast electric vehicles, with the VF 6 joining the VF 3, VF 5, VF 7, and VF 9.

This year marks the event's 20th anniversary, featuring over 120 brands and more than 30 automotive manufacturers. <br/><br/>Along with the VF 6 launch, VinFast is rolling out a free charging program at its dedicated charging station network, valid until May 1, 2027, providing \"zero fuel cost\" benefits to customers. Operated by the Global Charging Station Development Company V-GREEN, the network aims to deploy 15,000 charging ports across the country in 2025. <br/><br/>On this occasion, VinFast also announced the signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with two banks\u2014EastWest Bank and BDO\u2014to support the Philippines' green transition and sustainable growth. These partnerships will focus on developing and offering financial solutions that support VinFast's green ecosystem, while making it easier for Filipinos to switch to electric mobility. <br/><br/>Pham Sanh Chau, CEO of VinFast Asia, said: \"We're thrilled to launch the VF 6 at one of the Philippines' most prestigious auto shows and contribute to the strong momentum behind green mobility. With its smart, comfortable, and cost-efficient performance, this model is poised to become an essential part of the modern family's sustainable lifestyle. We hope it will replicate its segment-leading success in Vietnam and receive the same enthusiastic response as seen in the European market.\" <br/><br/>Nguyen Thanh Duong, CEO of V-GREEN, added: \"We are proud to partner with VinFast in building a comprehensive and convenient EV ecosystem.

Today, it is the world's economic engine, contributing more than half of global growth. But will this success lead to greater cooperation, or will fragmentation define the region's rise? The answer lies in the choices we make today. The Boao Forum for Asia 2025 presented an opportunity to shape those decisions, urging sustainable and inclusive growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indonesia has long played a role in the Boao Forum. In 2005, then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono addressed the forum under the theme \"Asia Searching for Win-Win: The New Role for Asia\". That year marked the establishment of the strategic partnership between Indonesia and China, setting the stage for future collaboration.</p><p>Today, the global landscape is shifting rapidly, with economic realignments, technological breakthroughs, geopolitical tensions, and climate change impacts. Now is the time to think bigger, act faster, and collaborate more deeply.</p><p>Sustainability is more than crisis management; it's about lifting communities out of poverty, safeguarding natural resources, and ensuring long-term prosperity. Resilience may not yield immediate returns, but it lays the foundation for stability.</p><p>Under President Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia is integrating infrastructure, food security, water management and energy sustainability into a unified strategy. These areas are interconnected. No infrastructure is valuable without electricity, clean water or agricultural productivity. Indonesia's initiatives, such as improving irrigation systems and scaling renewable energy, contribute to a resilient economy. In Central Java, improved irrigation has boosted agricultural yields, reducing climate risks.</p><p>No country can tackle sustainable development alone. Climate risk, energy security and food resilience are global challenges that require cooperation. True sustainability can only be achieved through joint action. Three areas stand out: infrastructure connectivity, the clean energy transition and digital transformation.</p><p>Infrastructure connectivity is crucial for trade and investment. Without efficient roads, ports and digital networks, economic growth stagnates. Indonesia advocates for deeper cooperation on cross-border infrastructure to ensure widespread benefits. The Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 offers a framework, while countries such as Vietnam and Thailand highlight how public-private partnerships can accelerate development.</p><p>Building on this regional commitment, Indonesia actively fosters partnerships with key international players to enhance its infrastructure network. A notable example is the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, also known as Whoosh, developed in collaboration with China as part of Indonesia's broader infrastructure strategy. Beyond enhancing connectivity, the project stimulates economic growth along its corridor, generating new opportunities for businesses and local communities.</p><p>Regional cooperation is vital for the clean energy transition. Moving away from fossil fuels presents challenges for emerging economies, but reliance on outdated energy sources is unsustainable. The Asian Development Bank estimates that unchecked climate change could shrink regional GDP by up to 17 percent by 2070. On the other hand, investment in green infrastructure and clean energy could unlock billions of dollars in economic gains and create thousands of jobs. Indonesia, with the world's largest geothermal reserves, is making renewable energy a central part of its strategy.</p><p>Indonesia's energy transition extends beyond geothermal development to the strategic expansion of its battery and electric vehicles ecosystem. A key priority is advancing its nickel downstream industry to maximize domestic value creation and strengthen global competitiveness. To support this vision, Indonesia has engaged international partners, with investment from China playing a significant role in accelerating development. By leveraging its resources, fostering innovation, and driving industrial growth, Indonesia is positioning itself as a major player in the global battery and EV supply chain.</p><p>Digital governance must also be addressed. Artificial intelligence, data and automation are reshaping industries, offering potential to enhance energy efficiency, healthcare and education. But without regulation, these technologies could widen inequalities and create security risks. Indonesia supports the establishment of a global framework for AI governance to ensure technology benefits society while reducing digital divides. Clear regulations and ethical standards are necessary for inclusive growth.</p><p>As global dynamics change, Asia stands at a critical juncture. Will it become a battleground for rivalries, or will it rise as a unified force for stability and progress? Traditional security frameworks that focus on military strength and economic power are no longer sufficient. Long-term resilience now depends on food, water and energy security, as well as defense and diplomacy.</p><p>For decades, the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations has anchored regional stability, guided by the belief that regional challenges require regional solutions. Strengthening ASEAN institutions, advancing security dialogues, and reinforcing multilateral partnerships are key to lasting peace and economic resilience. A connected Asia is not only an engine of growth but also a pillar of geopolitical stability. Through cooperation with diverse partners, including China as a comprehensive strategic partner, ASEAN plays a vital role in promoting inclusive and sustainable growth, ensuring that the benefits are widely shared across the region.</p><p>Regional cooperation faces challenges such as diverging national interests and economic disparities. But the cost of fragmentation is much higher. A more integrated Asia benefits everyone, ensuring collective resilience in an era of uncertainty.</p><p>Sustainable development is no longer just an economic priority; it is a security imperative. Trust, shared responsibility, and inclusive growth must underpin Asia's development agenda. Decisions made today will determine whether the region emerges as a model of unity and innovation or succumbs to division and short-termism.</p><p>The future is not something to wait for; it is something we build together. Governments must commit to bold reforms, businesses must drive sustainable innovation, and regional partnerships must move from rhetoric to results. Only then will Asia's rise be defined by collaboration rather than fragmentation.</p><p>As the Javanese say, Becik ketitik, olo ketoro; good deeds will be seen, and bad deeds will not stay hidden forever. The choices we make will define the world our children inherit.</p><p>The author is coordinating minister for the Infrastructure and Regional Development, Indonesia.

Superstructure building works refer to the building works in relation to the parts of the structure above the ground level and the scope of the Group's superstructure building works contracts mostly consists of development projects for residential and commercial buildings.</p><p>RMAA works refer to the repair, maintenance, alteration and addition works for an existing structure. The Group reported a net loss of approximately HK$19.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2022, increased by approximately HK$7.1 million, compared to that of approximately HK$12.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2021.</p><p>The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the following combined effect of:</p><p>(i) increase in revenue recognised by the Group for the year ended 31 March 2022 substantially due to (a) revenue recognised from three sizeable projects for superstructure building works awarded in 2020 of which the construction works commenced by the year ended 31 March 2021 and were in full swing during the year ended 31 March 2022; and (b) the increase in value of variation works from one project being approved;</p><p>(ii) increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to the income from the variation order works of certain works done from construction projects being approved, resulting in gross profit for the year ended 31 March 2022; and</p><p>(iii) one-off fair value loss of derivative financial liability of approximately HK$19.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2022 (2021: HK$Nil).</p><p>GOING FORWARD</p><p>During the year ended 31 March 2022 and up to the date of this annual report, the Group was successfully awarded several sizeable building construction contracts.</p><p>July 25 2022: Golden Ponder Holdings : Outlook</p><p>During the year ended 31 March 2022 and up to the date of this report, the Group was successfully awarded several sizeable building construction contracts. Facing the uncertain economic outlook, the Group is still cautiously optimistic in maintaining the Group's construction business and competitiveness in the future.</p><p>Looking ahead, the Group will adopt a cautious approach. Firstly, the economy in Hong Kong is expected to recover after dominated effects by the pandemic. There will be more projects available for tender amid of a further competitive environment. The Board foresees the Group's profit and profit margin will continue to be under pressure. Within the Group, we are transforming and exploring new business opportunities, including expansion of existing business.</p><p>With the increasing awareness of environmental protection globally and greater emphasis in ESG by stakeholders, there is the trend of green buildings construction and the Group envisions to develop its unique competitiveness by exploring solutions to integrate environmental technologies with building construction including but not limited to the research and application of green construction materials. Further, in order to diversify our source of income and attain growth in the long term, the Group considers that the environmental protection business in Hong Kong is a suitable long-term business opportunity for the Company.</p><p>On the other hand, the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong rolled out a HK$2 billion EHSS to subsidise the installation of EV charging-enabling infrastructure in car parks of existing private residential buildings, and hence further facilitate EV owners to install EV chargers at car parks of their residences according to their own needs in the future in a simple and easy manner.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 20, 863 words </p><p>July 29: Envision Greenwise Holdings : Chairman's Statement</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>Over the past year, the complex changes in the international landscape and the intensive adjustments in economic policies have introduced numerous uncertainties to the global markets. In the face of these challenges, the Group has adhered to the philosophy of sustainable development, proactively responded to changes in the external environment, and continuously strengthened its core competitiveness through prudent operational strategies and optimized resource allocation. For the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group recorded revenue of HK$869.7 million, an increase of 92.3% from the previous financial year; gross profit of HK$102.7 million, up by 266.8% year-on-year; and adjusted annual EBITDA profit of HK$44.8 million, achieving a turnaround from loss to profit. This represents a significant achievement in our business transformation and a solid step forward in the Group's pursuit of green development.</p><p>In addition to acting as the Hong Kong main contractor for superstructure building and repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition works, the Group has vigorously expanded its green business in recent years, particularly in the development of a global power battery recycling system, where its related operations have achieved breakthrough progress. Moving forward, the Group will continue to leverage green business as a driving force to promote efficient resource utilization and low-carbon transformation, steadily creating growing value returns for shareholders while contributing to the establishment of a green industrial ecosystem in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the development of a global circular economy.</p><p>GOING FORWARD</p><p>Global electric vehicle sales have repeatedly hit record highs, driving a simultaneous surge in demand for lithiumion batteries and retired battery processing. Since initiating its transformation in 2023, the Group has adopted the strategic direction of \"anchoring in Hong Kong while expanding globally\" and proactively positioned itself in key areas amid the electrification trend, focusing on developing sustainable solutions for power batteries and other related businesses.</p><p>Rooted in Hong Kong, its subsidiary was officially approved to build \"Hong Kong's First EV Battery Processing Plant\" in June 2024, and construction is currently progressing steadily. Leveraging the Group's extensive technical expertise and comprehensive certifications in battery recycling, the facility will utilize advanced equipment and technology to meet local demand for retired lithiumion battery processing while serving as a hub in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to collaborate with industry partners in expanding a green recycling economy system. The Group is also actively engaged in advancing green infrastructure initiatives. This includes promoting batteries energy storage systems to provide safe, reliable, and low-carbon power solutions for construction sites and commercial and industrial applications; providing infrastructure support for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in communities by complementing the EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme (EHSS) and supporting the development of its EV charging facilities business; additionally, the Group is exploring innovative pathways for retired battery repurposing in energy storage, aiming to establish a closed-loop battery lifecycle management system. These efforts not only strengthen Hong Kong's low-carbon transition but also unlock substantial business growth opportunities for the Group.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Group continues to strengthen its global footprint, establishing over 70 service locations across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, regions with mature electrification markets to build an internationally connected recycling network, providing customers with one-stop green energy management solutions. Key global markets such as Europe have recently introduced new regulations on battery traceability management and recycling, significantly raising industry compliance thresholds. In the future, compliance licenses and professional expertise will become critical intangible assets and core competitive barriers in the sector. With its comprehensive licensing coverage for power battery recycling across major global markets, the Group has established a differentiated competitive advantage in rapidly responding to regional demands, reinforcing its leading position in global business expansion; additionally, its locally embedded operational teams are deeply attuned to regional market characteristics, providing crucial support for technology implementation and service responsiveness. These dual advantages continue to serve as strategic engines for advancing the standardization of global power battery recycling and regeneration chains, delivering strong momentum for the Group's business growth.</p><p>In terms of resource collaboration, the Group also deepened strategic partnerships with leading domestic and overseas industry players, including renowned automakers, core battery suppliers, and energy storage service providers. With the accelerating adoption of commercial electric vehicles, such as electric trucks and electric ferries, coupled with technological breakthroughs and favorable policies, the momentum toward the full electrification of transportation is expected to intensify. This will drive the maturation of the retired battery recycling industry and other energy utilization value chains, presenting vast prospects for future development.</p><p>APPRECIATION</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to all employees for their hard work, shareholders for their continued trust, business partners for their close collaboration, and the broader community for their unwavering support. We will continue to drive growth through innovation, respond to market changes with agility, and deepen our sustainable development strategy centred on renewable energy and low-carbon solutions to deliver steady growth and enhance long-term competitiveness for our shareholders. At the same time, through close collaboration with our partners, we will promote the green transformation of our industries and collaborate with the community to advance towards a net-zero future.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 258 words </p><p>July 29: ENVISION GREENWISE: DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO RULES 13.13 AND 13.15 OF THE LISTING RULES</p><p>ADVANCES TO THE BORROWER</p><p>On 6 January 2025, the Company entered into a Facility Agreement with the Borrower, pursuant to which, the Company as the lender and the Borrower as the borrower agreed that, the Company shall provide an advance to the Borrower, in the total principal amount of USD7,000,000 at the simple interest rate of 5% p.a.</p><p>On 23 January 2025, the Company entered into an Addendum to the Facility Agreement with the Borrower, pursuant to which, the Company and the Borrower agreed to increase the total principal amount under the Facility Agreement by USD3,000,000, while the other terms and conditions shall remain unchanged.</p><p>LISTING RULES IMPLICATIONS</p><p>As the highest applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of the Facility Agreement on a standalone basis exceeds 5% but is lower than 25%, the Facility Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereunder constituted a discloseable transaction for the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>As the Agreement and the Addendum were entered into within a 12-month period, when aggregated as a series of transaction pursuant to Rules 14.22 and 14.23 of the Listing Rules, the highest applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of the Addendum (when aggregated with the Facility Agreement) exceeds 5% but is lower than 25%, constituting a discloseable transaction for the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 265 words </p><p>July 29: ENVISION GREENWISE: DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTION IN RELATION TO THE ENTERING INTO OF THE SALES COOPERATION AGREEMENT INVOLVING THE ISSUE OF CONSIDERATION SHARES UNDER GENERAL MANDATE</p><p>SALES COOPERATION AGREEMENT</p><p>On 28 July 2025 (after trading hours), the Company and FMG entered into the Sales Cooperation Agreement, pursuant to which FMG has conditionally agreed to supply the Products exclusively to the Company pursuant to the purchase orders to be placed by the Company, and the Company has agreed to market and sell the Products worldwide (the \"Cooperation\").</p><p>In consideration of the Cooperation, the Company agreed to pay to FMG the total consideration of US$20,000,000.00, which shall be settled by the Company by the issue and allotment of the Consideration Shares at the Issue Price on the Effective Date of the Cooperation.

In the face of these challenges, the Group has adhered to the philosophy of sustainable development, proactively responded to changes in the external environment, and continuously strengthened its core competitiveness through prudent operational strategies and optimized resource allocation. For the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group recorded revenue of HK$869.7 million, an increase of 92.3% from the previous financial year; gross profit of HK$102.7 million, up by 266.8% year-on-year; and adjusted annual EBITDA profit of HK$44.8 million, achieving a turnaround from loss to profit. This represents a significant achievement in our business transformation and a solid step forward in the Group's pursuit of green development.</p><p>In addition to acting as the Hong Kong main contractor for superstructure building and repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition works, the Group has vigorously expanded its green business in recent years, particularly in the development of a global power battery recycling system, where its related operations have achieved breakthrough progress. Moving forward, the Group will continue to leverage green business as a driving force to promote efficient resource utilization and low-carbon transformation, steadily creating growing value returns for shareholders while contributing to the establishment of a green industrial ecosystem in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the development of a global circular economy.</p><p>GOING FORWARD</p><p>Global electric vehicle sales have repeatedly hit record highs, driving a simultaneous surge in demand for lithiumion batteries and retired battery processing. Since initiating its transformation in 2023, the Group has adopted the strategic direction of \"anchoring in Hong Kong while expanding globally\" and proactively positioned itself in key areas amid the electrification trend, focusing on developing sustainable solutions for power batteries and other related businesses.</p><p>Rooted in Hong Kong, its subsidiary was officially approved to build \"Hong Kong's First EV Battery Processing Plant\" in June 2024, and construction is currently progressing steadily. Leveraging the Group's extensive technical expertise and comprehensive certifications in battery recycling, the facility will utilize advanced equipment and technology to meet local demand for retired lithiumion battery processing while serving as a hub in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to collaborate with industry partners in expanding a green recycling economy system. The Group is also actively engaged in advancing green infrastructure initiatives. This includes promoting batteries energy storage systems to provide safe, reliable, and low-carbon power solutions for construction sites and commercial and industrial applications; providing infrastructure support for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in communities by complementing the EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme (EHSS) and supporting the development of its EV charging facilities business; additionally, the Group is exploring innovative pathways for retired battery repurposing in energy storage, aiming to establish a closed-loop battery lifecycle management system. These efforts not only strengthen Hong Kong's low-carbon transition but also unlock substantial business growth opportunities for the Group.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Group continues to strengthen its global footprint, establishing over 70 service locations across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, regions with mature electrification markets to build an internationally connected recycling network, providing customers with one-stop green energy management solutions. Key global markets such as Europe have recently introduced new regulations on battery traceability management and recycling, significantly raising industry compliance thresholds. In the future, compliance licenses and professional expertise will become critical intangible assets and core competitive barriers in the sector. With its comprehensive licensing coverage for power battery recycling across major global markets, the Group has established a differentiated competitive advantage in rapidly responding to regional demands, reinforcing its leading position in global business expansion; additionally, its locally embedded operational teams are deeply attuned to regional market characteristics, providing crucial support for technology implementation and service responsiveness. These dual advantages continue to serve as strategic engines for advancing the standardization of global power battery recycling and regeneration chains, delivering strong momentum for the Group's business growth.</p><p>In terms of resource collaboration, the Group also deepened strategic partnerships with leading domestic and overseas industry players, including renowned automakers, core battery suppliers, and energy storage service providers. With the accelerating adoption of commercial electric vehicles, such as electric trucks and electric ferries, coupled with technological breakthroughs and favorable policies, the momentum toward the full electrification of transportation is expected to intensify. This will drive the maturation of the retired battery recycling industry and other energy utilization value chains, presenting vast prospects for future development.</p><p>APPRECIATION</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to all employees for their hard work, shareholders for their continued trust, business partners for their close collaboration, and the broader community for their unwavering support. We will continue to drive growth through innovation, respond to market changes with agility, and deepen our sustainable development strategy centred on renewable energy and low-carbon solutions to deliver steady growth and enhance long-term competitiveness for our shareholders. At the same time, through close collaboration with our partners, we will promote the green transformation of our industries and collaborate with the community to advance towards a net-zero future.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 258 words </p><p>July 29: ENVISION GREENWISE: DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO RULES 13.13 AND 13.15 OF THE LISTING RULES</p><p>ADVANCES TO THE BORROWER</p><p>On 6 January 2025, the Company entered into a Facility Agreement with the Borrower, pursuant to which, the Company as the lender and the Borrower as the borrower agreed that, the Company shall provide an advance to the Borrower, in the total principal amount of USD7,000,000 at the simple interest rate of 5% p.a.</p><p>On 23 January 2025, the Company entered into an Addendum to the Facility Agreement with the Borrower, pursuant to which, the Company and the Borrower agreed to increase the total principal amount under the Facility Agreement by USD3,000,000, while the other terms and conditions shall remain unchanged.</p><p>LISTING RULES IMPLICATIONS</p><p>As the highest applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of the Facility Agreement on a standalone basis exceeds 5% but is lower than 25%, the Facility Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereunder constituted a discloseable transaction for the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>As the Agreement and the Addendum were entered into within a 12-month period, when aggregated as a series of transaction pursuant to Rules 14.22 and 14.23 of the Listing Rules, the highest applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of the Addendum (when aggregated with the Facility Agreement) exceeds 5% but is lower than 25%, constituting a discloseable transaction for the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 20, 227 words </p><p>July 29: Envision Greenwise Holdings : Outlook</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK</p><p>The Group principally provides superstructure building and RMAA works service as a main contractor in Hong Kong.

Themed \"Innovate to Elevate; Forge Ahead to Break New Ground\", the policy speech articulated a forward-looking agenda aimed at reinvigorating Macao's socioeconomic fabric through strategic reforms, fiscal prudence, and regional collaboration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since assuming office in December, Sam has faced the dual challenges of sustaining Macao's post-COVID 19 pandemic recovery while addressing structural vulnerabilities in its gaming-centric economy. His address, blending pragmatism with ambition, signals a commitment to transforming Macao into a resilient, diversified hub aligned with national development priorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A cornerstone of the policy blueprint is the continuation \u2014 and recalibration \u2014 of the widely lauded Wealth Partaking Scheme. Under this initiative, permanent residents will receive 10,000 patacas ($1,250), while nonpermanent residents will be allocated 6,000 patacas each. While maintaining this popular measure, the Macao SAR government has astutely announced plans to refine eligibility criteria to prioritize individuals who demonstrate genuine residency or substantive ties to Macao. This recalibration reflects a nuanced understanding of fiscal sustainability: While cash injections remain a vital tool for social cohesion, their long-term viability demands stricter targeting to avoid misuse.</p><p>Personally, I concur with this recalibration. By channeling resources toward residents who actively contribute to Macao's economy, whether through employment, entrepreneurship, or civic participation, the Macao SAR government ensures that public funds catalyze productivity rather than perpetuate dependency. This approach also mitigates risks of inflationary pressures, a concern in economies overly reliant on direct cash transfers. Furthermore, it aligns with global best practices in social welfare, where means-testing and residency requirements are increasingly employed to balance generosity with accountability.</p><p>Macao's demographic challenges \u2014 a rapidly aging population and a fertility rate that ranks among the world's lowest \u2014 loom large over its future. The Policy Address confronts these issues head-on through a suite of measures designed to alleviate financial burdens on young families while enhancing support for seniors. Notably, the monthly childcare subsidy for Macao-born children under three has been set at 1,500 patacas for permanent residents, a significant increase that acknowledges the steep costs of early childhood care. Concurrently, marriage and birth subsidies have been elevated to 2,220 patacas and 6,500 patacas, respectively, incentivizing family formation in a society where delayed marriages and one-person households are increasingly common.</p><p>For the elderly, the Macao SAR government has pledged to augment old-age pensions and living allowances, ensuring that Macao's seniors, who constitute nearly 13 percent of a population that is nudging 7 million, can age with dignity amid rising healthcare and living costs. These policies exemplify a holistic approach to social welfare: By addressing both ends of the demographic spectrum, the Macao SAR government seeks to stabilize population dynamics while fostering intergenerational equity. Critics may argue that monetary incentives alone cannot reverse entrenched cultural shifts, yet such measures are undeniably a critical first step in creating an environment where families feel financially secure to grow.</p><p>While social welfare reforms dominate headlines, the Policy Address' most transformative elements lie in its economic vision. Central to this is the establishment of a 10-billion-pataca fund to bolster small and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of Macao's nongaming economy. The newly launched SME Bank Loan Interest Subsidy Scheme offers a 4 percent annual interest subsidy, capped at three years, for loans up to 5 million patacas. This initiative not only alleviates liquidity constraints but also encourages SMEs to innovate and expand, particularly in sectors like technology, green energy, and cultural tourism.</p><p>However, the Macao SAR government's ambitions extend far beyond financial subsidies. In a bold strategic pivot, Sam emphasized Macao's integration into the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and the broader Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area initiative. By leveraging Macao's unique status as a global tourism and leisure hub, the Macao SAR aims to position itself as a gateway for the Chinese mainland and international businesses seeking access to Greater Bay Area markets. A key component of this strategy involves incentivizing casino operators, whose concessions are up for renewal in 2030, to increase investments in nongaming sectors.</p><p>This recalibration is both timely and imperative. While gaming taxes historically contributed over 80 percent of government revenue, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the perils of overreliance on a single industry. By mandating that casino conglomerates allocate resources to sectors like MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, exhibitions), healthcare, and fintech, Macao can cultivate a more resilient, multifaceted economy. For instance, proposals for integrated resorts featuring AI-driven entertainment complexes or biomedical research hubs could redefine Macao's global identity.</p><p>The Policy Address also underscores the untapped potential for collaboration between Macao and Hong Kong. While both SARs possess distinct economic identities, their complementary strengths \u2014 Hong Kong's financial prowess and Macao's tourism expertise \u2014 create fertile ground for partnership. Sam's call for Hong Kong entrepreneurs to invest in Hengqin's development is particularly astute. Hong Kong's multinational corporations, with their extensive networks and innovation ecosystems, could partner with Macao's SMEs to develop smart-city technologies, green infrastructure, or cultural heritage projects.</p><p>Moreover, cross-border initiatives could alleviate pressures in both cities. Hong Kong's saturated real estate market and high living costs, for example, might be mitigated by encouraging professionals to reside in Hengqin while working in Hong Kong via improved transport links. Conversely, Macao's hospitality sector could benefit from Hong Kong's expertise in luxury retail and entertainment, fostering a regional tourism circuit that rivals Singapore or Dubai.</p><p>Macao's approach to casino operators offers a paradigm for other regions grappling with corporate social responsibility. By tying license renewals to investments in community-centric projects, affordable housing, vocational training centers, or renewable energy infrastructure, the Macao SAR government ensures that private sector profits are reinvested into public goods. Hong Kong, which is facing its own challenges with wealth inequality and housing shortages, could adopt similar mechanisms for its property developers or financial institutions. Imagine a policy where banks contributing to a \"social innovation fund\" receive tax breaks, thereby channeling capital toward grassroots initiatives.</p><p>Sam's inaugural Policy Address is a masterclass in balanced governance. It harmonizes short-term populism (cash transfers, childcare subsidies) with long-term structural reforms (economic diversification, regional integration). By confronting demographic decline through targeted welfare measures and reimagining Macao's economic identity beyond gaming, the administration demonstrates a clear-eyed understanding of the Macao SAR's challenges and opportunities.</p><p>Yet, the true test lies in execution. Success will depend on rigorous oversight of subsidy programs, seamless collaboration with Guangdong authorities in Hengqin, and fostering a culture of innovation among risk-averse local businesses. Additionally, Macao must cultivate talent, through education reforms and immigration incentives, to fuel its nascent industries.</p><p>As Macao navigates this transformative era, its policies offer valuable lessons for cities worldwide: That economic resilience stems from diversification; that demographic challenges demand intergenerational solutions; and that public-private partnerships, when strategically designed, can become engines of inclusive growth. In bridging tradition with innovation, Macao is not merely securing its own future \u2014 it is illuminating a path for others to follow.</p><p>The author is a Legislative Council member, founder of Save HK, and a member of the Central Committee of the New People's Party of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p><p>The views do not necessarily represent those of China Daily.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://campus-cdhk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/store_manager/photo_pre/13/152/55/353cec9f-2f29-4e01-9008-2645401d33de/high_wm.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["While both SARs possess distinct economic identities, their complementary strengths \u2014 Hong Kong's financial prowess and Macao's tourism expertise \u2014 create fertile ground for partnership.

In the face of these challenges, the Group has adhered to the philosophy of sustainable development, proactively responded to changes in the external environment, and continuously strengthened its core competitiveness through prudent operational strategies and optimized resource allocation. For the year ended 31 March 2025, the Group recorded revenue of HK$869.7 million, an increase of 92.3% from the previous financial year; gross profit of HK$102.7 million, up by 266.8% year-on-year; and adjusted annual EBITDA profit of HK$44.8 million, achieving a turnaround from loss to profit. This represents a significant achievement in our business transformation and a solid step forward in the Group's pursuit of green development.</p><p>In addition to acting as the Hong Kong main contractor for superstructure building and repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition works, the Group has vigorously expanded its green business in recent years, particularly in the development of a global power battery recycling system, where its related operations have achieved breakthrough progress. Moving forward, the Group will continue to leverage green business as a driving force to promote efficient resource utilization and low-carbon transformation, steadily creating growing value returns for shareholders while contributing to the establishment of a green industrial ecosystem in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the development of a global circular economy.</p><p>GOING FORWARD</p><p>Global electric vehicle sales have repeatedly hit record highs, driving a simultaneous surge in demand for lithiumion batteries and retired battery processing. Since initiating its transformation in 2023, the Group has adopted the strategic direction of \"anchoring in Hong Kong while expanding globally\" and proactively positioned itself in key areas amid the electrification trend, focusing on developing sustainable solutions for power batteries and other related businesses.</p><p>Rooted in Hong Kong, its subsidiary was officially approved to build \"Hong Kong's First EV Battery Processing Plant\" in June 2024, and construction is currently progressing steadily. Leveraging the Group's extensive technical expertise and comprehensive certifications in battery recycling, the facility will utilize advanced equipment and technology to meet local demand for retired lithiumion battery processing while serving as a hub in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to collaborate with industry partners in expanding a green recycling economy system. The Group is also actively engaged in advancing green infrastructure initiatives. This includes promoting batteries energy storage systems to provide safe, reliable, and low-carbon power solutions for construction sites and commercial and industrial applications; providing infrastructure support for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in communities by complementing the EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme (EHSS) and supporting the development of its EV charging facilities business; additionally, the Group is exploring innovative pathways for retired battery repurposing in energy storage, aiming to establish a closed-loop battery lifecycle management system. These efforts not only strengthen Hong Kong's low-carbon transition but also unlock substantial business growth opportunities for the Group.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Group continues to strengthen its global footprint, establishing over 70 service locations across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, regions with mature electrification markets to build an internationally connected recycling network, providing customers with one-stop green energy management solutions. Key global markets such as Europe have recently introduced new regulations on battery traceability management and recycling, significantly raising industry compliance thresholds. In the future, compliance licenses and professional expertise will become critical intangible assets and core competitive barriers in the sector. With its comprehensive licensing coverage for power battery recycling across major global markets, the Group has established a differentiated competitive advantage in rapidly responding to regional demands, reinforcing its leading position in global business expansion; additionally, its locally embedded operational teams are deeply attuned to regional market characteristics, providing crucial support for technology implementation and service responsiveness. These dual advantages continue to serve as strategic engines for advancing the standardization of global power battery recycling and regeneration chains, delivering strong momentum for the Group's business growth.</p><p>In terms of resource collaboration, the Group also deepened strategic partnerships with leading domestic and overseas industry players, including renowned automakers, core battery suppliers, and energy storage service providers. With the accelerating adoption of commercial electric vehicles, such as electric trucks and electric ferries, coupled with technological breakthroughs and favorable policies, the momentum toward the full electrification of transportation is expected to intensify. This will drive the maturation of the retired battery recycling industry and other energy utilization value chains, presenting vast prospects for future development.</p><p>APPRECIATION</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to all employees for their hard work, shareholders for their continued trust, business partners for their close collaboration, and the broader community for their unwavering support. We will continue to drive growth through innovation, respond to market changes with agility, and deepen our sustainable development strategy centred on renewable energy and low-carbon solutions to deliver steady growth and enhance long-term competitiveness for our shareholders. At the same time, through close collaboration with our partners, we will promote the green transformation of our industries and collaborate with the community to advance towards a net-zero future.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 20, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 258 words </p><p>July 29: ENVISION GREENWISE: DISCLOSEABLE TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO RULES 13.13 AND 13.15 OF THE LISTING RULES</p><p>ADVANCES TO THE BORROWER</p><p>On 6 January 2025, the Company entered into a Facility Agreement with the Borrower, pursuant to which, the Company as the lender and the Borrower as the borrower agreed that, the Company shall provide an advance to the Borrower, in the total principal amount of USD7,000,000 at the simple interest rate of 5% p.a.</p><p>On 23 January 2025, the Company entered into an Addendum to the Facility Agreement with the Borrower, pursuant to which, the Company and the Borrower agreed to increase the total principal amount under the Facility Agreement by USD3,000,000, while the other terms and conditions shall remain unchanged.</p><p>LISTING RULES IMPLICATIONS</p><p>As the highest applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of the Facility Agreement on a standalone basis exceeds 5% but is lower than 25%, the Facility Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereunder constituted a discloseable transaction for the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>As the Agreement and the Addendum were entered into within a 12-month period, when aggregated as a series of transaction pursuant to Rules 14.22 and 14.23 of the Listing Rules, the highest applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of the Addendum (when aggregated with the Facility Agreement) exceeds 5% but is lower than 25%, constituting a discloseable transaction for the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 20, 227 words </p><p>July 29: Envision Greenwise Holdings : Outlook</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK</p><p>The Group principally provides superstructure building and RMAA works service as a main contractor in Hong Kong.

It was known as a busy commercial hub and one of Shanghai\u2019s earliest urban areas.<br/><br/>Built in 1715 during the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the guild hall was the center of Shanghai\u2019s once busy sand barge trade.<br/><br/>It was established by the city\u2019s shipping merchants to coordinate business dealings, regulate shipping routes and resolve price disputes.<br/><br/>As the oldest of Shanghai\u2019s many trade guilds, it played a key role in shaping the city\u2019s early commercial development.<br/><br/>The building featured a two-story stage for performances, a 200-square-meter assembly hall for merchants and a guest building for visiting traders.<br/><br/>It was once the largest and most luxurious club in the city, used by influential figures in Shanghai\u2019s sand-shipping industry.<br/><br/>The guild hall\u2019s grandeur was matched by its intricate architecture, with corniced tile roofs, dragon and phoenix carvings and other ornamental wooden sculptures.<br/><br/>However, by the early 2000s, the once-proud hall had fallen into disrepair. The surrounding buildings were demolished before the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, leaving the guild hall isolated and increasingly dilapidated.<br/><br/>For years, the hall served as makeshift housing for construction workers, and its stages and assembly halls were converted into living spaces.<br/><br/>After the latest renewal project, the structure reopened as a public activity center and exhibition hall about Shanghai\u2019s maritime history.<br/><br/>The corniced tile roof and many wooden dragon and phoenix sculptures have been restored to remind visitors of the former glory of the city\u2019s shipping industry.<br/><br/>The Flower Bridge is another hallmark of the transformation. Spanning 5,600 square meters, the pedestrian bridge features lush greenery and is a vital link for the Dongjiadu business district. It is described as \u201cShanghai\u2019s most beautiful pedestrian overpass.\u201d<br/><br/>For Li Jia, a 28-year-old graphic designer, it has become a daily retreat. <br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a bridge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my unwinding ritual. The view and ambiance are therapeutic.\u201d<br/><br/>Lin Xiaojun, CEO and design principal of Shanghai Naqian Landscape Design, said: \u201cThe bridge is the first of its kind in Shanghai, with such a high volume of greenery. It connects the Huangpu Riverside with the commercial district, creating a seamless integration of green space and urban architecture.\u201d<br/><br/>The skywalk reduces the need for pedestrians to cross busy streets and serves as a scenic viewing platform, offering views of the river, the Lujiazui skyline and the Bund.<br/><br/>The bridge\u2019s design also incorporates a unique \u201cflower eye\u201d \u2014 a central void in the bridge that offers pedestrians a distinctive perspective of the traffic below.<br/><br/>The renewal project also includes the construction of six pocket parks across the area.<br/><br/>These green spaces are designed not only to beautify the neighborhood but also to provide residents, office workers, and tourists with areas for relaxation, fitness and social interaction.<br/><br/>The central garden at the Greenland Bund, for example, spans 13,000 square meters, equivalent to about two standard football pitches, and connects various parts of the area.<br/><br/>It serves as a hub for cultural activities and will soon be linked to an underground public space, enhancing accessibility and creating a multi-level urban experience.<br/><br/>\u201cPocket parks are a way to give people access to nature in a city where space is limited,\u201d said Zhu of the greenery management office.<br/><br/>\u201cThey offer people a place to relax, enjoy the environment and disconnect from the fast pace of city life.\u201d<br/><br/>The renewal project has faced several challenges, especially in integrating modern infrastructure with the preservation of historical sites.<br/><br/>The guild, for instance, required sensitive restoration work to ensure its historical elements were preserved while updating the surrounding area for modern use.<br/><br/>The designer Lin noted that the project team took great care to design spaces around the hall that were respectful of its historical value. They integrated classical Chinese garden esthetics with modern urban features.<br/><br/>\u201cWe wanted to create an environment that feels both historical and contemporary,\u201d said Lin. \u201cWe used elements like moon gates, low walls and lush gardens to preserve the feeling of the space while making it accessible to the public.\u201d<br/><br/>Another innovative feature of the urban renewal is the comprehensive pedestrian system, which includes both elevated pedestrian bridges and underground pathways. Such design helps reduce street-level congestion and creates a pedestrian-friendly environment, making it easier for people to move through the area.<br/><br/>As part of the city\u2019s broader goal to become a \u201cpark city,\u201d Dongjiadu is setting a precedent for how urban renewal can enhance quality of life while preserving historical and cultural landmarks.<br/><br/>\u201cWe are not just building new structures; we are creating a new way of living,\u201d said Zhu.<br/><br/>\u201cThe goal is to improve the quality of life by integrating nature into the city, preserving our history and creating a modern urban environment that works for everyone.\u201d<br/><br/>Restoration work for the Dongjiadu Cathedral, with a history spanning 180 years, has also been completed, preserving its original appearance.<br/><br/>Built in 1847 and completed in 1853, it was the first large-scale church established by Western missionaries in China after the Opium War.<br/><br/>Before the 1950s, it served as the cathedral of the Catholic Diocese of Shanghai, with a capacity to hold 2,000 people.<br/><br/>The church\u2019s restoration maintains its historical grandeur while ensuring its role as a significant cultural and religious landmark in the Dongjiadu area.<br/><br/>As the urban renewal project continues, Dongjiadu will feature more green spaces, including community botanical gardens and biodiversity education initiatives.<br/><br/>The area is becoming a unique example of how a modern city can honor its heritage while embracing sustainability, innovation and livability.</p>", "publisher": "Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)", "instances": ["The project redefines how a historic area can evolve in an environmentally sustainable way while honoring Shanghai\u2019s unique maritime past.

Backed by substantial resources, top talent, and cutting-edge technology, Vingroup is well-equipped to overcome the challenges and drive sustainable growth.</p><p>HANOI, VIETNAM \u2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.media-outreach.com/\">Media OutReach Newswire</url> \u2013 13 November 2024 - Driven by the vision of \"Creating a Green Future,\" Vingroup, Vietnam's largest private conglomerate, is strategically positioned to lead the nation's journey toward sustainability. Supported by substantial financial resources, a diverse and skilled workforce, and a strong commitment to innovation, Vingroup is set to overcome the financial, human, and technical challenges on the path to green transformation, contributing to Vietnam's ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. <br/><br/>Tackling the Financial Demands of Green Investment <br/><br/>Green transformation requires significant upfront investment, from infrastructure improvements to cutting-edge research in clean technology. For many companies, these financial demands are daunting. Yet Vingroup, a significant contributor to Vietnam's economy, accounting for 1.6% of GDP in 2023, is uniquely equipped to meet these challenges. <br/><br/>This financial strength has empowered Vingroup to spearhead ambitious projects that would be out of reach for many other firms. Its automotive subsidiary, VinFast, exemplifies this commitment. Vingroup's substantial financial strength has enabled it to undertake ambitious projects that would be beyond the reach of many other companies. A prime example is its electric vehicle (EV) subsidiary, VinFast. In just over five years, VinFast has emerged as a leading automotive brand in Vietnam. By October 2024, it achieved a historic milestone as the country's best-selling automotive brand, surpassing both foreign and domestic competitors, including traditional gasoline-powered brands. This also positions Vietnam among the few countries with a domestic leader in the electric vehicle sector. <br/><br/>Internationally, VinFast has rapidly expanded its presence across North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. This early success underscores Vingroup's ability to drive sustainable, long-term projects. <br/><br/>But beyond its financial capacity to fund green projects, Vingroup's strategic approach is also redefining industries by prioritizing sustainability. From electric vehicles to eco-friendly real estate development, Vingroup is setting a new benchmark for sustainable growth, inspiring other companies to follow suit. <br/><br/>Building a Skilled Workforce <br/><br/>While financial resources are crucial, skilled talent is essential for driving sustainable innovation. Vingroup has proactively recruited top global talent with both technical expertise and a passion for environmental progress. <br/><br/>Through strategic hiring, Vingroup has attracted renowned scientists, engineers, and technical experts, including renowned figures like Professor Vu Ha Van, who joined the Vingroup Big Data Institute as Scientific Director in 2018. Also a professor of mathematics at Yale, Professor Van returned to Vietnam after a pivotal conversation with Vingroup's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, during which he saw in Vuong a shared vision to make a significant impact in Vietnamese science and technology. This commitment to attracting top talent has not only strengthened Vingroup's technical capacity but also infused it with valuable international perspectives, which are critical to achieving environmentally friendly practices. <br/><br/>Vingroup's emphasis on people embodies its belief that sustainability is ultimately driven by the individuals leading these efforts. By fostering a skilled and motivated workforce, Vingroup has reinforced its position as a leader that values intellectual capital, empowering it to pioneer sustainable development across its sectors. <br/><br/>Overcoming Technical Complexity in Green Transformation <br/><br/>Beyond finances and talent, green transformation requires advanced technical solutions, from energy-efficient systems to green infrastructure and sustainable product design. Implementing these on a meaningful scale demands a sustained commitment to research and development (R&amp;D) and strategic partnerships. Vingroup has embraced these technical challenges by investing heavily in in-house R&amp;D and engaging in impactful collaborations. <br/><br/>In sustainable urban development, for example, Vingroup's TechnoPark Tower achieved LEED Platinum certification, the highest standard for green buildings. This high-rise integrates nearly 3,000 smart sensors for lighting and air-conditioning, allowing automatic adjustments that save up to 17.4% in energy use annually. <br/><br/>VinFast, too, exemplifies Vingroup's technical focus, with investments in EV battery recycling through partnerships with Japan's Marubeni and North America's Li-Cycle to ensure lithium-ion batteries are reused, showing that cutting-edge technology can be implemented sustainably. <br/><br/>Vingroup's real estate arm, Vinhomes, has also integrated green infrastructure into its projects, including extensive electric vehicle-friendly facilities across its residential developments. This interconnected approach enables each subsidiary to contributing to Vingroup's overall sustainability goals. Such synergy across the whole ecosystem amplifies the effect of each green initiative, transforming sustainability from isolated efforts into a unified mission embraced by all branches. <br/><br/>Visionary Leadership in the Face of Global Challenges <br/><br/>Vingroup's commitment to sustainability reflects not only strong business acumen but also a broader vision of responsible corporate stewardship. As a corporation that operates on both local and global stages, Vingroup understands the responsibility large companies have in addressing environmental challenges. With Vietnam's national pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Vingroup's role takes on greater significance, supporting the country's ambitious climate goals. <br/><br/>The leadership's vision for a sustainable future is evident in its alignment with Vietnam's environmental objectives, setting an example for other enterprises. Vingroup's initiatives demonstrate that economic success and environmental responsibility can not only coexist but also drive long-term corporate growth, showcasing the importance of sustainable practices in shaping the future of business in Vietnam and beyond. <br/><br/>Hashtag: #Vingroup #ESG #greenfuture #VinFast #EV<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://vingroup.net/en\">https://vingroup.net/en</url></p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://release.media-outreach.com/release.php/Images/Thumb/400x0/563453/563453-image-1-jpeg-400x0.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://release.media-outreach.com/release.php/Images/563453/image-1.jpeg\">By October 2024, VinFast has become the top-selling automotive brand in Vietnam, affirming its potential and promising prospects for future growth. - Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://release.media-outreach.com/Release/templates/images/socialMedia/generic_link.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mP8/5+hHgAHggJ/PchI7wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\">site does not use correct feed url - Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Media OutReach (English)", "instances": ["Vingroup's emphasis on people embodies its belief that sustainability is ultimately driven by the individuals leading these efforts.

However, if the system fails to manage a flash flood like the one in September 2023, history may repeat itself.  <br/>Green groups have been advocating for the government to adopt \"blue-green infrastructure\" solutions by integrating green space, trees and natural drainage into the urban environment. This kind of infrastructure must be incorporated into all new government projects. With incentives, private developers can adopt it too.  <br/>An analysis of the Spanish flood by World Weather Attribution indicates the rainfall was about 12 per cent heavier than it would have been if human-induced warming had not occurred. It also found that such weather events are now twice as likely.  <br/>To tackle the climate crisis and alleviate the risk of these environmental catastrophes, the world should consider enhancing each and every climate action plan. That includes Hong Kong.  <br/>Our per capita electricity use has climbed between 2011 and 2021 to 22.25 gigajoules. Amending the Building Efficiency Ordinance is a feasible policy solution. The authorities should consider the recommendations from The Green Earth. We suggest that buildings should be required to explain and improve their energy utility index if it increases compared to their previous audit score. The energy management opportunities identified through the audit should be widely adopted to reduce emissions.  <br/>As a community, Hong Kong must recognise that every effort counts in fighting climate change. Doing business as usual is no longer an option if we wish to prevent the loss of lives or damage to property due to flash floods, super typhoons or extreme heat. <br/> Rico Wong, deputy director, The Green Earth</p>", "publisher": "South China Morning Post", "instances": ["Highly urbanised Hong Kong relies heavily on its drainage system to divert rainwater during storms.

How does Vale view the future demand for steel and iron ore in China? What adjustments will the company make to its business and development strategy?</p><p>Gustavo Pimenta: China is very important for Vale. It is the world's largest steel manufacturer and iron ore consumer. It has been our largest market since 2006 and destination of more than 50% of our iron ore products since 2014. We believe that China will continue to be our most important market in the future.</p><p>China's latest policies bring positive prospects to our industry.</p><p>Firstly, China has set its deficit-to-GDP ratio for this year at around 4%, an increase of 1 percentage point from last year. It marks the first time on record that China has set the deficit-to-GDP ratio at 4%, which sends out positive signals that China will step up efforts to navigate challenges and boost economic development.</p><p>Secondly, the implementation of pro-consumption measures, such as the consumer goods trade-in program, have boosted sales of automobiles and home appliances, especially those with lower carbon footprints. According to the government work report, this year, China will issue ultra-long special treasury bonds of 300 billion yuan to support the implementation of the consumer goods trade-in program, doubling the scale from last year. We believe the manufacturing industry will continue to achieve stable development this year and in the future, which will spur demand for steel and its raw materials like iron ore.</p><p>For markets outside China, we have observed growth there, particularly in India. However, China will remain at the core of our business strategy, and we are making every effort to meet the evolving demands of our Chinese customers.</p><p>Vale plans to increase its iron ore production year by year. To that end, it has launched the Novo Caraj\u00e1s program to expand iron ore and copper production. What is the rationale behind this move?</p><p>On the demand side, we anticipate that iron ore demand will remain stable in the coming years. In 2024, demand for seaborne iron ore was approximately 1.55 billion tons. We estimate that this demand will basically remain flat at 1.545 billion tons in 2030.</p><p>On supply side, we believe that supply challenges have been consistently underestimated. In 2024, the total supply of iron ore was approximately 1.6 billion tons. We estimate that this supply will decrease to approximately 1.495 billion tons in 2030. The primary cause of this decrease is resource exhaustion. Based on a traditional depletion rate of around 3%, the supply reduction due to resource depletion is expected to reach about 300 million tons. Additionally, companies with operating cost higher than $90 per ton will quit the market, meaning that the supply will decrease by 150 million tons. These decreases will be partially offset by new projects. However, ultimately, there will be a shortfall of around 50 million tons.</p><p>In mid-February, we launched the Novo Caraj\u00e1s program, in the presence of our president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, focusing on resuming and maintaining iron ore volumes and expanding copper production. This program foresees investments of 70 billion reais ($12.3 billion) in 2025-2030, which is in line with our guidance.</p><p>Caraj\u00e1s is rich in minerals essential for decarbonization and the global energy transition. The program aims to bring together Caraj\u00e1s' mining expansion potential, including mines in operation, expanded projects and new projects, to strengthen our ability to process critical minerals to produce high quality iron ore for green steel and copper for energy transition, which is of great importance to reducing carbon emissions.</p><p>The program stems from our strong confidence in China's long-term prospects, unswerving commitment to cultivating the Chinese market, and enthusiastic willingness to continue growing with China.</p><p>The mining and metals market, where Vale works in, is naturally cyclical. It is very important for Vale to be resilient at any point in the cycle. Our top priority is to maximize efficiency in capital allocation and operating costs. This ensures that we can optimize our assets to achieve their intended performance levels.</p><p>Vale plans to establish three mega hubs in the Middle East and build an iron ore concentrating plant in Oman. What are the company's consideration behind this Middle East expansion? Which regions will be the primary markets for the iron ore produced in the Middle East?</p><p>Mega hubs are industrial complexes that aim to produce hot briquetted iron (HBI) through direct reduction route. Compared with the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route using coal, the direct reduction route using natural gas can substantially reduce carbon emissions in the steelmaking chain. In the future, if natural gas is replaced by green hydrogen, carbon emissions may even arrive at zero.</p><p>We have already announced plans to develop mega hubs in the Middle East and other regions. The Middle East enjoys a unique set of conditions including competitive energy prices, strategic location and entrepreneurial mindset, which we believe are perfect to develop mega hubs. These mega hubs shall supply different markets across the globe supporting the decarbonization of the steelmaking industry.</p><p>Vale is a long-term partner of China for over 50 years. At the same time, Vale has more than a decade of experience operating in the Middle East. We look forward to working with our Chinese partners to further grow our business in the Middle East, strengthen our operations in the region, and create long-term value for the global steel industry.</p><p>What are the progress and challenges of Vale's carbon emission reduction goals?</p><p>As the leader in the high-quality iron ore market, Vale is naturally well-positioned for a low-carbon economy. In recent years, while continuously supplying high-quality iron ore products to China, we have developed multiple solutions to support the green transition of the steel industry.</p><p>We are committed to helping our steelmaking customers overcome the challenges of reducing their carbon emissions. We have established a goal of reducing our net scope 3 emissions by 15% by 2035. To reach the goal, we spent almost 20 years developing a product called iron ore briquette. This revolutionary product can be used in the conventional BF-BOF route, which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 10%. It can also be used in the cleaner direct reduction route to produce low-carbon steel. Studies indicate that for every ton of steel produced via the BF-BOF route, two tons of CO2 are emitted. In contrast, the CO2 emissions can reduce to between 0.6 ton and 1 ton if the direct reduction route is applied.</p><p>So far, we have signed agreements with more than 50 steelmakers to provide them with solutions designed to reduce carbon emissions during production.</p><p>We have developed a new business model called mega hubs and we see tremendous opportunities for collaboration with China in this area. Mega Hubs are industrial complexes designed to produce HBI through the direct reduction route. Compared to the traditional BF-BOF route that relies on coal, the direct reduction route utilizing natural gas can significantly reduce carbon emissions across the steelmaking chain. We have signed agreements to develop mega hubs in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Oman.</p><p>As the energy transition in Europe and the U.S. appears to be slowing, will Vale adjust its corporate strategy accordingly?</p><p>Today, energy-related emissions account for over 80% of the global total. Although renewable energy output has more than doubled in the last decade, it makes up only slightly over 13% of total energy use. Transforming how we use energy is crucial for both energy security and carbon emission reduction.</p><p>It is important for developing countries to strike a balance between sustainability, affordability and energy security. Last year, President Lula launched the National Energy Transition Policy. And energy transition is one of the six pillars in our country's Ecological Transformation Plan. China has become the world's largest investor in energy transition. In 2023, China's investment in energy transition reached $676 billion. Last year, China invested $818 billion in clean energy technology, up 20% year-on-year.</p><p>Vale has a unique advantage in meeting the growing demand for critical minerals essential for the global energy transition. We will meet the growing demand driven by the expansion of renewable energy, electrification and green infrastructure by increasing copper output, particularly in the Caraj\u00e1s region. This will allow us to leverage the advantages of our unique mineral assets and synergies with the existing local infrastructure.</p><p>How is Vale collaborating with Chinese companies, particularly steelmakers, on decarbonization, and what advantages do these partners bring in low-carbon technologies?</p><p>Our path to decarbonization is inseparable from China. In terms of Scope 3 emissions, which account for 98% our total emissions, as more than 60% of our iron ore products are sold to China, we are eager to collaborate with our Chinese customers on decarbonization.</p><p>Recently, I had the privilege to witness the signing of the MoU (memorandum of understanding) with HBIS Group with its chairman, Mr. Liu Jian. We will deepen collaboration on decarbonization and jointly promote the green and low carbon development of the steel industry. HBIS Group is one of our most important customers in China and our teams have maintained close and in-depth exchanges on steelmaking decarbonization. We are excited to sign this MoU to further deepen our collaboration in this field.</p><p>Shipping is another major source of our Scope 3 emissions. We have also closely partnered with China in this field. A good example is the 400,000-dwt (deadweight tonnage) very large ore carrier, Sohar Max, which is one of the largest vessels in the world with a wind propulsion system. This vessel is mainly used to transport Vale's iron ore from Brazil to China. Last year, the ship completed the installation of five rotor sails, which enhances energy efficiency by up to 6% and reduce CO2 emissions by up to 3,000 tons per ship per year. The rotor sails were produced by Chengxi Shipyard Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corp. Ltd. (CSSC), and were installed by COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry (Zhoushan) Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of China COSCO Shipping Corp. Ltd.</p><p>In terms of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, our Sol do Cerrado solar energy park in Brazil uses the photovoltaic modules and spare parts supplied by JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd., which has supported our company in achieving our goal of \"100% renewable electricity consumption in Brazil\" in 2023, two years ahead of our schedule.</p><p>In November 2024, we signed a letter of intent with BYD Co. Ltd. to study the electrification of light vehicles. In the coming months, the two companies will make assessments on the installation of vehicle charging infrastructure in Vale's operational areas. During the same period, Vale will make tests on some electric car models in our operational areas. The tests will start with BYD's Dolphin model and will then be carried out with its Shark pickup truck. In addition, cooperation also includes tours of Vale's operational areas, where the two sides will verify several issues including charging structure, ways of using the vehicles and maintenance services required to ensure the good performance of the fleet. We are glad to have BYD's support in this initiative, which reinforces our commitment to accelerating decarbonization, both at Vale and in our supply chain.</p><p>How does Vale apply artificial intelligence (AI) technology in mining operations and shipping?</p><p>AI is reshaping how Vale manages its manufacturing processes and resources. For example, by using AI-powered process control models, we have improved ore recovery rate by 2%.</p><p>We also use an AI solution for predicting the estimated time of arrival of Vale's ships at ports. The solution uses AI models to analyze data and predict voyage times, providing optimal speed recommendations. The technology helps us improve port operations and management as it reduces fuel consumption and lowers CO2 emissions.</p><p>What's your view on the impact of the AI revolution on industries?</p><p>AI is profoundly transforming the industrial sector, offering businesses opportunities to improve efficiency, safety, and innovation.</p><p>In the mining industry, AI can transform operations by optimizing processes, reducing costs and improving decision-making. By leveraging advanced algorithms, machine learning models, deep learning, generative AI and computer vision, mining companies can analyze vast amounts of data to predict equipment failures, optimize resource extraction and improve overall productivity.</p><p>For example, AI can be used to help identify potential mineral deposits and the feasibility for their exploitation, save time spent in discovering mineral deposits and reduce costs. With the help of AI, we will be able to predict local customer demand to offer them mineral products they want. In summary, the integration of AI into mining operations is not just a trend, it is crucial for maintaining and improving competitiveness.</p><p>Wang Xintong contributed to this story.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Contact reporter Ding Yi (yiding@caixin.com ) and editor Michael Bellart (michaelbellart@caixin.com )</p>", "publisher": "Caixin Global (Online)", "instances": ["Last year, China invested $818 billion in clean energy technology, up 20% year-on-year.

Reliable results from modeling were used to assess the individual contribution of LID and improved drainage facilities to urban flooding mitigation. We selected a natural island in Guangzhou City, China, as the study site. The results indicate that combining three LID measures, namely green roofs, sunken green spaces, and permeable pavements, can reduce total runoff by 41.7% to 25.89% for rainfall recurrence periods ranging from 1 year to 100 years, and decrease the volume of nodal overflow by nearly half during rainfall events of less than 10-year return period.

Known affectionately as \"Dr. Tree,\" Jim Chi-yung stands out as a champion of Hong Kong's green heritage. His pioneering work in urban forestry has helped transform the city's skyline into a greener, more sustainable space, offering a model for other cities grappling with the environmental challenges of rapid urbanization. \"People often think of my field as purely technical, but urban forestry is an interdisciplinary science,\" Jim, a research chair professor and advisor of Geography and Environmental Science at the Education University of Hong Kong, and a former head of the Department of Geography at the Univeristy of Hong Kong, told Xinhua. </p><p>\"It demands that we balance conservation with the many competing needs of urban development.\" In September this year, a ranking by Standford University named Jim the world's leading forestry scientist, out of more than 35,000 researchers, who not only retained his top spot in the \"Single-Year Impact List\", but also topped \"the lifetime impact list.\" On the rooftop of CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP)'s Chui Ling Road substation in Tseung Kwan O lies Hong Kong's largest \"sky woodland.\" The rooftop brimmed with native trees, its walls draped with climbing plants, creating a strikingly verdant contrast amid the cityscape. A walk through this green canopy feels like entering a natural forest, a haven for urban wildlife in the heart of a bustling city -- a brainchild of Jim's decades of research in initially soil science and later on arboriculture and urban ecology. Jim's efforts are particularly evident in his preservation of \"champion trees\" -- mature, often ancient specimens that form the backbone of Hong Kong's green heritage. Many of these trees, such as the century-old camphor trees on Haiphong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, have become at stake amid urban expansion and typhoons. Fortunately, Jim came to their rescue with his expertise. \"Champion trees are vital to Hong Kong's natural and cultural identity, and cannot be left unattended,\" Jim said. His advocacy also led to the creation of a government registry for ancient trees. For decades, Jim has been trailblazing in shaping policies that protect these natural monuments. His influence was crucial in influencing the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation's decision to preserve the stone wall trees at Forbes Street during the construction of West Island Line's Kennedy Town Station. Perhaps the most recent and transformative aspect of Jim's work is his focus on green infrastructure, transforming rooftops and walls into sustainable ecosystems. Unlike traditional green roofs that often rely solely on grass or shrubs, Jim incorporated native trees to create self-sustaining and biodiverse spaces. Besides the CLP rooftop forest, Jim has designed more than 20 green rooftops in Hong Kong, including projects for the University of Hong Kong and Tai Po Market Station. \"The environmental benefits of these green spaces go beyond aesthetics,\" said Jim, \"They help cut energy costs through natural insulation, extend lifespan for roof waterproofing, improve air quality, and support biodiversity, which in turn helps cities adapt to climate change.\" At 71, Jim's work is as relevant as ever. His current projects include improving the microclimates in Hong Kong's cramped subdivided homes, where many low-income families live. \"Urban ecology is not just about trees, but about the quality of life in cities, particularly in areas where the environment has been compromised by rapid development,\" he said. For decades, Dr. Tree's commitment has extended beyond research into mentoring the next generation of environmental scientists, including Benedict Essuman-Quainoo, a former PhD student and now a lecturer at the Education University of Hong Kong. Benedict, originally from Ghana in West Africa, has embraced Jim's focus on \"nature in cities,\" working to promote sustainable and resilient urban ecosystems in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world, including his home country. \"In a city where every square foot counts, Dr. Jim has shown that there is always space for nature to flourish,\" Benedict said. \"Dr. Jim is so meticulous, from research design, and methodology to writing style, and is punctuate in everything,\" Benedict said. \"He is such an inspiration for me, both in the past and now, with that passion for research and care for his students.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["For decades, Jim has been trailblazing in shaping policies that protect these natural monuments.

With their unique status under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, both SARs are poised to deepen their global presence, particularly within the expanding Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. While the premier's address underscored Beijing's continued commitment to the SARs' high degree of autonomy, the real significance lies in how Hong Kong and Macao can evolve amid shifting economic paradigms, structural reforms on the Chinese mainland, and volatile conditions in world markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the macroeconomic front, China's performance in 2024 \u2014 gross domestic product reaching 134.9 trillion yuan ($18.6 trillion), up 5 percent \u2014 displays a resilience that defies many global trends. This standout growth echoes a broad-based strategy: fueling infrastructure, fostering advanced manufacturing, encouraging technological breakthroughs, and driving domestic demand as an engine of sustainability. High-tech industries, from artificial intelligence to new energy, have taken center stage. For Hong Kong and Macao, whose global brands rest in finance, tourism, culture, and professional services, the current nationwide emphasis on innovation offers a mutually beneficial pathway to enhance competitiveness and expand reach.</p><p>Integral to this idea is the Greater Bay Area's growing influence. Since its launch in 2019, the 11-city cluster has aimed to merge Hong Kong's global connections, Macao's cultural-tourism strengths, and Shenzhen's technological prowess. The result is a region that bets heavily on advanced manufacturing and next-generation industries, whether in semiconductors, biotech, or clean energy. More than a conglomeration of diverse markets, the region stands as a carefully coordinated initiative designed to expedite cross-border workflow, connect supply chains, and channel capital into emerging areas. This synergy increases the region's appeal to multinational companies, many of which seek an Asian foothold that seamlessly blends global best practices with reliable infrastructure.</p><p>Notably, the region's value proposition has garnered international interest. German high-tech firms have taken notice of Shenzhen's electronics ecosystem and Hong Kong's financial infrastructure, exploring joint ventures that leverage each area's respective strengths. Likewise, Swiss banking institutions are deepening their relationships with their Hong Kong-based counterparts, particularly around sustainable investment products \u2014 a sign that capital flows can remain robust despite external uncertainties. These examples illustrate that while the concept of the Greater Bay Area is still evolving, it already holds tangible influence in global economic corridors.</p><p>Beyond commercial gains, one of the most salient aspects of Beijing's broader outlook is its willingness to keep opening up. The removal of foreign equity caps in several manufacturing sectors in the mainland, for instance, signals a real commitment to capital inflow and cross-border collaboration. Though some might question China's current global stance, one cannot discount how these policy shifts make the market more navigable for overseas entities. When paired with Hong Kong's continuity as a financial and legal hub, this spells new possibilities for foreign direct investment and advanced industry development that tie directly back to the Greater Bay Area's integrated model.</p><p>All this hinges on structural stability. During 2024, China's leadership pursued a balanced approach \u2014 bolstering domestic growth, maintaining moderate inflation, and promoting job creation. This steadiness benefits Hong Kong, a city that thrives on predictability. Access to a stable currency, diverse capital markets, and robust trade volumes fosters confidence for global companies seeking an Asian base. Additionally, steady job creation in core mainland cities boosts overall consumption, a trend that can ripple across the border, especially if Hong Kong's service industries continue capitalizing on cross-boundary economic opportunities. Developments in Macao's leisure and hospitality sectors follow a similar logic: A rising Chinese middle class spells potential for tourism and gaming, provided appropriate diversification efforts continue apace.</p><p>By sustaining thoughtful reforms, nurturing global partnerships, and ensuring a stable social fabric, they can seize the opportunity that the \"one country, two systems\" principle continues to provide \u2014 and, in the process, remain exemplars of resilience and progress in an ever-evolving world</p><p>Even so, challenges lie beneath these encouraging statistics. A cooling global economy, persistent inflation in the West, and geopolitical tensions present significant risks \u2014 whether in supply chain disruptions or in external attempts to curtail technology transfers. Rising trade barriers affect not just major mainland exporters but Hong Kong's re-export and logistics functions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the global race for cutting-edge tech \u2014 encompassing everything from AI algorithms to advanced semiconductor design \u2014 enlists the Greater Bay Area as it works to become a hotspot for both manufacturing and research and development.</p><p>In these circumstances, Hong Kong's adaptability may prove its greatest asset. The city has reinvented itself across eras: from a manufacturing center to a financial services hub, and now toward a knowledge-driven economy blending fintech, digital entertainment, and biotechnology. By aligning more fully with the mainland's innovation initiatives \u2014 such as strengthening ties with labs and startups in Shenzhen \u2014 Hong Kong can establish itself as a launchpad for capital-intensive ventures that benefit from a global perspective and local entrepreneurial spirit. Simultaneously, Macao can continue to explore niche tourism and cultural projects, further diversifying its offerings to draw international visitors and firms seeking a foothold in Portuguese-speaking markets.</p><p>Meanwhile, any robust development blueprint must incorporate social considerations. Beijing's focus on environmental sustainability \u2014 reflected in lower PM2.5 (particulate matter) levels and a higher ratio of \"good air days\" across major cities \u2014 demonstrates a growing recognition that long-term prosperity requires a healthy ecosystem. With Hong Kong's environmental non-governmental organizations and climate tech startups already spearheading initiatives in areas like green finance, there is fertile ground for deeper cross-border partnerships that champion eco-conscious policies. Developing the Greater Bay Area as an exemplar of sustainable urban growth could pull in global stakeholders eager to invest in green infrastructure.</p><p>The social dimension also includes housing, healthcare, and education \u2014 areas that demand continued attention to maintain public trust. For years, Hong Kong's housing market has been notoriously constrained, with deep repercussions for social equity. If policymakers prioritize cross-boundary exchange of both talent and resources within the Greater Bay Area, it might gradually ease local pressure and introduce new residential and commercial solutions. Likewise, greater cooperation in public health, highlighted by shared COVID-19 pandemic experiences, could help both SARs build a safety net more resilient to future crises.</p><p>At the same time, safeguarding national security and social stability remains a government priority. This is where the \"one country, two systems\" principle must be maintained through balanced approaches that respect local autonomy while fostering constructive integration with the mainland. Given this backdrop, Hong Kong and Macao need to remain vigilant about preserving what sets them apart \u2014 transparent institutions, an international legal framework, and a cosmopolitan social fabric \u2014 so that both can continue serving as gateways between the mainland and the rest of the world.</p><p>Ultimately, as the central government signals confidence in the SARs, the true measure of that support will be how effectively Hong Kong and Macao leverage it. It is not enough to tout growth figures or the potential of the Greater Bay Area; success depends on pragmatic execution \u2014 streamlining cross-border regulations, securing top-tier global talent, and investing in forward-looking industries. By doing so, both SARs reaffirm their standing as pivotal hubs under China's broad modernization plan while securing their place in an increasingly turbulent world.</p><p>In this sense, the premier's report resonates strongly in the streets of Central and the promenades of Macao. The bigger story is the promise that arises when open-minded governance, a readiness to embrace competition, and respect for local distinctiveness combine. Even in uncertain times, Hong Kong and Macao have what it takes to rise above external pressures and domestic challenges, so long as they align with the robust momentum unleashed across the Greater Bay Area and the broader mainland. By sustaining thoughtful reforms, nurturing global partnerships, and ensuring a stable social fabric, they can seize the opportunity that the \"one country, two systems\" principle continues to provide \u2014 and, in the process, remain exemplars of resilience and progress in an ever-evolving world.</p><p>The author is the convener at China Retold, a member of the Legislative Council, and a member of the Central Committee of the New People's Party.</p><p>The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://campus-cdhk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/store_manager/photo_pre/13/184/143/73a09c3d-8f5f-4b53-892d-2c70c0518b48/high_wm.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["5 (particulate matter) levels and a higher ratio of \"good air days\" across major cities \u2014 demonstrates a growing recognition that long-term prosperity requires a healthy ecosystem.

It was known as a busy commercial hub and one of Shanghai's earliest urban areas.<br/><br/>Built in 1715 during the early Qing Dynasty (1368-1644), the guild hall was the center of Shanghai's once busy sand barge trade.<br/><br/>It was established by the city's shipping merchants to coordinate business dealings, regulate shipping routes, and resolve price disputes.<br/><br/>As the oldest of Shanghai's many trade guilds, it played a key role in shaping the city's early commercial development.<br/><br/>The building featured a two-story stage for performances, a 200-square-meter assembly hall for merchants, and a guest building for visiting traders.<br/><br/>It was once the largest and most luxurious club in the city, used by influential figures in Shanghai's sand-shipping industry.<br/><br/>The guild hall's grandeur was matched by its intricate architecture, with corniced tile roofs, dragon and phoenix carvings and other ornamental wooden sculptures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, by the early 2000s, the once-proud hall had fallen into disrepair. The surrounding buildings were demolished before the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, leaving the guild hall isolated and increasingly dilapidated.<br/><br/>For years, the hall served as makeshift housing for construction workers, and its stages and assembly halls were converted into living spaces.<br/><br/>After the latest renewal project, the structure reopened as a public activity center and exhibition hall about Shanghai's maritime history.<br/><br/>The corniced tile roof and many wooden dragon and phoenix sculptures have been restored to remind visitors of the former glory of the city's shipping industry.<br/><br/>The Flower Bridge is another hallmark of the transformation. Spanning 5,600 square meters, the pedestrian bridge features lush greenery and is a vital link for the Dongjiadu business district. It is described as \"Shanghai's most beautiful pedestrian overpass.\"<br/><br/>For Li Jia, a 28-year-old graphic designer, it has become a daily retreat. \"It's not just a bridge,\" she said. \"It's part of my unwinding ritual. The view and ambiance are therapeutic.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"The bridge is the first of its kind in Shanghai, with such a high volume of greenery,\" said Lin Xiaojun, CEO &amp; Design Principal of Shanghai Naqian Landscape Design.<br/><br/>\"It connects the Huangpu Riverside with the commercial district, creating a seamless integration of green space and urban architecture.\"<br/><br/>The skywalk reduces the need for pedestrians to cross busy streets and serves as a scenic viewing platform, offering views of the river, the Lujiazui skyline and the Bund.<br/><br/>The bridge's design also incorporates a unique \"flower eye\" \u2013 a central void in the bridge that offers pedestrians a distinctive perspective of the traffic below.<br/><br/>The renewal project also includes the construction of six pocket parks across the area.<br/><br/>These green spaces are designed not only to beautify the neighborhood but also to provide residents, office workers, and tourists with areas for relaxation, fitness and social interaction.<br/><br/>The central garden at the Greenland Bund, for example, spans 13,000 square meters, equivalent to about two standard football pitches, and connects various parts of the area.<br/><br/>It serves as a hub for cultural activities and will soon be linked to an underground public space, enhancing accessibility and creating a multi-level urban experience.<br/><br/><br/>\"Pocket parks are a way to give people access to nature in a city where space is limited,\" said Zhu of the greenery management office.<br/><br/>\"They offer people a place to relax, enjoy the environment, and disconnect from the fast pace of city life.\"<br/><br/>The renewal project has faced several challenges, especially in integrating modern infrastructure with the preservation of historical sites.<br/><br/>The guild, for instance, required sensitive restoration work to ensure its historical elements were preserved while updating the surrounding area for modern use.<br/><br/>The designer Lin noted that the project team took great care to design spaces around the hall that were respectful of its historical value. They integrated classical Chinese garden aesthetics with modern urban features.<br/><br/>\"We wanted to create an environment that feels both historical and contemporary,\" said Lin. \"We used elements like moon gates, low walls, and lush gardens to preserve the feeling of the space while making it accessible to the public.\"<br/><br/>Another innovative feature of the urban renewal is the comprehensive pedestrian system, which includes both elevated pedestrian bridges and underground pathways.<br/><br/>Such design helps reduce street-level congestion and creates a pedestrian-friendly environment, making it easier for people to move through the area.<br/><br/><br/>As part of the city's broader goal to become a \"park city,\" Dongjiadu is setting a precedent for how urban renewal can enhance quality of life while preserving historical and cultural landmarks.<br/><br/>\"We are not just building new structures; we are creating a new way of living,\" said Zhu.<br/><br/>\"The goal is to improve the quality of life by integrating nature into the city, preserving our history, and creating a modern urban environment that works for everyone.\"<br/><br/>Restoration work for the Dongjiadu Cathedral, with a history spanning 180 years, has also been completed, preserving its original appearance.<br/><br/>Built in 1847 and completed in 1853, it was the first large-scale church established by Western missionaries in China after the Opium War.<br/><br/>Before the 1950s, it served as the cathedral of the Catholic Diocese of Shanghai and was the largest Catholic church in China, with a capacity to hold 2,000 people.<br/><br/>The church's restoration maintains its historical grandeur while ensuring its role as a significant cultural and religious landmark in the Dongjiadu area.<br/><br/>As the urban renewal project continues, Dongjiadu will feature more green spaces, including community botanical gardens and biodiversity education initiatives.<br/><br/>The area is becoming a unique example of how a modern city can honor its heritage while embracing sustainability, innovation, and livability.</p>", "publisher": "Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)", "instances": ["The project redefines how a historic district can evolve in an environmentally sustainable way while honoring Shanghai's unique maritime past.

Gouveia \u2014 a nature enthusiast, assistant professor, and leader of the urban ecology lab at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School \u2014 has over 10 years of research experience in several countries, including the Czech Republic, the U.S., and the U.K.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> From 2016 to 2019, the Portuguese spent four years at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Now based in Shenzhen, Gouveia described the opportunity to establish her lab as a dream come true for any researcher.<br/><br/><br/><br/> A passion for ecology<br/><br/><br/><br/> Gouveia attributes her love of nature to her father, a fellow nature lover who enjoyed gardening. \u201cI grew up surrounded by nature, and we had a very large garden,\u201d she recalled.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Sharing an anecdote about her childhood fascination with small insects, she said, \u201cEvery time I returned home, my mother would say, \u2018Show me your pocket. What\u2019s inside?\u2019\u201d Gouveia would pull little insects out, chuckling. \u201cI was always curious about animals and wanted to learn more about them.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Her love of nature inspired her to pursue a career in ecological research. Encouraged by a professor who shared her passion for nature, ecology, biology, and zoology during her bachelor\u2019s studies, she shifted her focus from biology in her undergraduate and master\u2019s programs to specialize in ecology during her Ph.D., ultimately becoming a professor in the field.<br/><br/><br/><br/> As a researcher, Gouveia believes that passion is essential. \u201cSometimes research can be tedious. Data collection may not always yield expected results, and setbacks are common. Without love and passion, you can\u2019t work effectively,\u201d she noted. \u201cFirst, we need to help people understand the importance of studying ecology. Then, we must inspire them to fall in love with it.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Founding a lab<br/><br/><br/><br/> Gouveia\u2019s journey in Shenzhen began in February 2023 when she accepted an offer from Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School that would allow her to establish an urban ecology lab. \u201cThe job offer was incredibly appealing. The opportunity to build a lab from scratch is rare in academia,\u201d Gouveia said.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In just six months, she transformed a modestly sized, empty room into a fully equipped lab, complete with cabinets, microscopes, drones, and various detectors. The lab also houses butterflies and other insect species, which are central to its research focus.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Gouveia\u2019s lab now consists of nine members, including one postdoctoral researcher, four master\u2019s students, three Ph.D. candidates, and Gouveia herself. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my group,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing their outcomes as we\u2019re still in the early stages.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Gouveia mentioned that Shenzhen is a \u201cperfect place for urban ecological research.\u201d She explained, \u201cShenzhen is like a gigantic lab. We have mangroves, oceans, rivers, and mountains \u2014 every natural element is present here.

BRICS countries are expected to bring online a combined 72 gigawatts of fossil-fuel generating capacity this year, compared with 190 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity added by China, India and Brazil alone so far, according to the article, citing a report released on Tuesday by Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco-based non-profit. This signals an important milestone in the clean energy transition for the bloc, which not only shows that the BRICS countries have taken solid steps on the road to the green energy transition, but also suggests that they will not follow the old development path of Western countries that relied on fossil fuels. Instead, they will explore a new energy development path that aligns with their own national conditions and the global sustainable development goals.As representatives of emerging markets and developing countries, the BRICS nations are experiencing rapid economic growth accompanied by a significant demand for energy. </p><p>However, they face multiple challenges, including global climate change, energy supply security and environmental pollution, which make it basically impossible for them to follow the fossil fuel-dependent development model that some Western nations employed in the past. This is also why BRICS nations now need to pursue a greener and low-carbon development path tailored to their unique national conditions through cooperation and innovation.As a member of the BRICS nations, China has made significant strides in renewable energy, achieving substantial increases in installed capacity alongside remarkable advancements in technology and cost-effectiveness. China's success serves as a valuable reference for other BRICS countries, helping lower technological costs. Nations such as India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa have also implemented policies to promote the development of renewable energy, thereby accelerating the development of renewable energy projects.The technical support and shared demands for the energy transition, along with common challenges related to energy security, environmental protection and economic development, create a strong basis for cooperation among BRICS countries in the realm of new energy. In this context, collaboration on the energy transition and green low-carbon initiatives among BRICS nations is becoming increasingly close, resulting in a number of cooperative projects.Take South Africa's 100-megawatt Redstone Concentrated Solar Thermal Power (CSP) Project as an example. In mid-September, the Redstone project, built by a Chinese enterprise, was connected to the grid. Once fully operational, the project will contribute approximately 480 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity to South Africa's grid each year, meeting the electricity needs of more than 200,000 households, according to media reports.Moreover, the establishment of the New Development Bank has provided important financial support to member countries in terms of green infrastructure. The bank announced that it will provide $30 billion in funding support to member countries from 2022 to 2026, with 40 percent of the funds allocated to mitigate climate change, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Such financial support has promoted investment in clean energy among member countries and accelerated the commercialization of new energy technologies. Exploration and collaboration on new-energy development among BRICS countries not only inject fresh momentum into their own sustainable growth but also offer new possibilities for the global energy transition and climate change mitigation. Through tangible actions, they illustrate that developing nations do not need to replicate the old paths of developed countries; rather, they can pursue and implement green, low-carbon development models while fostering economic growth. This new approach not only helps alleviate global climate change but also serves as a reference for other developing nations. </p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["In mid-September, the Redstone project, built by a Chinese enterprise, was connected to the grid.

Noting that it has been 16 years since the G20 Summit was launched, Xi said that proceeding from a new starting point, the G20 needs to build on its past achievements and continue to act as a force to improve global governance and move history forward. It is important to keep in mind that mankind lives in a community with a shared future, Xi said, adding that G20 members should see each other's development as opportunities rather than challenges, and view each other as partners rather than rivals, Xi said. </p><p>It is also important to observe the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and defend the international order based on international law, he said. Greater international consensus could be built to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, he added. The Chinese president made a five-point proposal to improve global governance. First, the G20 needs to improve global economic governance and build a world economy characterized by cooperation. The G20 should stay committed to strengthening global economic partnerships, reinforcing macro policy coordination, cultivating new quality productive forces, creating a ballast for macro policy coordination, and fostering an open, inclusive, and nondiscriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. It is also important to create a clean business environment by upholding a zero-tolerance stance against corruption and stepping up international cooperation on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery. Second, the G20 needs to improve global financial governance and build a world economy characterized by stability. The voice and representation of developing countries should be increased, and joint efforts are needed to keep the international financial market stable and prevent negative spillover of domestic monetary policy adjustments. Developed countries should fulfill their responsibilities in this regard. It is important to enhance the systems for financial risk monitoring, early warning and handling, and strengthen the global financial safety net to better meet the green financing needs of developing countries. Third, the G20 needs to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterized by openness. The G20 should further promote the reform of the World Trade Organization, oppose protectionism, avoid politicizing economic issues, fragmenting the global market and taking protectionist moves in the name of green and low-carbon development. The bloc should work together to build industrial and supply chain partnerships that are more equal, inclusive and constructive. Fourth, the G20 needs to improve global digital governance and build a world economy characterized by innovation. It is important to lead the digital transition, the deep integration of the digital economy and the real economy, and rules-making in emerging areas. International governance and cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI) should be strengthened, to make sure that AI is for good and for all. China will hold another world AI conference in 2025 and welcomes the participation of fellow G20 members. Fifth, the G20 needs to improve global ecological governance and build a world economy characterized by eco-friendliness.

Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed comprehensively advancing high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).The symposium is of great importance as it provides a window to summarize the BRI development over the last 11 years, while also charting out a new course for advancing high-quality BRI cooperation in 2025, scholars said.\"This year's symposium placed greater emphasis on strengthening mechanisms for the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, with a particular focus on connectivity. Connectivity extends beyond the 'hard connectivity' of infrastructure to include the 'soft connectivity' of rules and standards, as well as the 'heart connectivity' that nurtures deeper bond between peoples in partner countries,\" Maya Majueran, director of Belt and Road Initiative Sri Lanka (BRISL), a Sri Lanka-based organization that specializes in BRI cooperation, told the Global Times on Thursday. According to Majueran, the symposium also reiterated the importance of building a human community with a shared future, which is a core principle that continues to resonate strongly with the Global South countries. </p><p>\"This vision is one of the key reasons for the Global South's active participation in the BRI,\" he said.Yasir Habib Khan, founder and director of Pakistan-based Institute of International Relations and Media Research, told the Global Times the symposium has offered a crucial window to gauge the startling achievement of BRI global cooperation throughout 2024, a pivotal year which marks the 11th anniversary of BRI and the beginning of its second decade voyage.The initiative was put forth in 2013, and by the end of 2024, the BRI cooperation has \"achieved numerous breakthroughs that have significantly benefited the global economy,\" Khan said, while taking example of the recent inauguration of Chancay Port in Peru, which welcomed its first cargo ship from Taicang Port in Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu Province in November.On Tuesday, the 100,000th China-Europe freight train arrived in Germany, marking a historic milestone for the flagship BRI connectivity project which was incepted 13 years ago. \"Under the BRI framework, China has collaborated with partner countries to build critical infrastructure such as roads, railways, power plants, and ports, while also funding community-focused projects like hospitals and schools. These efforts reflect China's commitment to high-quality development and its significant contributions to global progress,\" Majueran said.So far, China has signed BRI cooperation documents with more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, according to the symposium. Data from the Ministry of Commerce showed that by the end of 2023, Chinese companies had established 17,000 overseas enterprises in countries participating in the BRI, with direct investment exceeding $330 billion.Overcoming challenges The symposium noted that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change in recent years. According to foreign scholars, China and other BRI partner countries have joined hands to overcome those challenges and effectively address the impact of geopolitical conflicts.\"Throughout the year, global politics and economics, dominated by unipolar powers, have continued to exert significant pressure on the multilateral free trade system, sparking an undercurrent of 'anti-globalization' in 2024\u2026 Despite the evolving context, BRI global cooperation has been carrying out resolutely,\" Khan noted.He stressed that in the case of Pakistan, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship BRI project, has faced several challenges and terrorist threats this year. However, China's cooperation with Pakistan has remained steadfast and unwavering, not deterred by the obstacles or challenges.Foreign experts also dismissed certain Western politicians' hype on so-called concerns over debt sustainability, environmental impact, and national security of BRI projects, calling those allegations \"groundless.\"\"It is important to note that China sees all countries, regardless of size, strength, wealth, or development status, as equal members of the international community. And China rejects hegemony and power politics, promoting a world where no nation imposes its will on others,\" Majueran said. He stressed that this inclusive and cooperative approach, as exemplified by BRI, has positioned China as a trusted partner in the Global South, fostering win-win solutions and offering an appealing alternative to traditional power dynamics.Development prospectsDuring the symposium held in Beijing, Xi also pointed out that the Belt and Road cooperation has entered a new period of high-quality development.Looking forward, analysts stressed that BRI cooperation will continue the high-quality development course, but with more focus on projects that are \"more sustainable, feature long-term partnerships and enhance the economic self-resilience of participating nations.\"According to Khan, one of the focal areas will be on promoting technological and artificial intelligence (AI) cooperation. \"Since BRI is gaining prestige to enter in 2025 soon, the implementation of the Belt and Road Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan will take a lead as well. And BRI will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in fostering exchanges and dialogue with other countries, driving a global revolution in AI development,\" he added.The green economy seems to be another high priority next year. According to one of the eight major steps announced by China last year in support of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, China will implement the Green Investment Principles for BRI, and provide 100,000 training opportunities for partner countries by 2030.It is expected that China will deepen cooperation in areas such as green infrastructure, green energy and green transportation, and step up support for the BRI International Green Development Coalition, which was set up in 2023, Khan noted.The ultimate aim of the BRI's high-quality development is to deliver tangible and meaningful benefits to all participating nations. And to achieve this, the future development of BRI should prioritize high standards, sustainability, and improving lives by enhancing cooperation quality, boosting investment efficiency, ensuring superior supply chain standards, and strengthening development resilience, Majueran said. </p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["The green economy seems to be another high priority next year.
