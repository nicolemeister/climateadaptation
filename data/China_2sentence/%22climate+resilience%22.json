Model validation demonstrated robust predictive accuracy. Four primary environmental predictors obtained from WorldClim version 2.1-the minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6), annual precipitation (Bio12), maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5), and elevation-collectively explained over 90% of habitat suitability.

He highlighted the urgent need for such solutions, noting that nearly 70 percent of China's arable land \u2014 92.7 million hectares \u2014 is considered low to medium-yield, severely limiting agricultural output. Unhealthy soil can lead to an estimated annual loss of 1.5 tons of yield per hectare.</p><p>The study, first-authored by Wang Guangzhou, an associate professor at China Agricultural University, underscores how intensive agriculture, with its singular focus on production, has inadvertently damaged soil health, leading to salinization, acidification, structural barriers and infertility. Wang stressed the critical role of microorganisms in fostering plant growth, enhancing soil quality, and optimizing positive plant-soil feedback.</p><p>\"At the individual plant level, we propose measures such as enhancing the release of root exudates, which act as chemical signals to beneficial microbes,\" Wang said.</p><p>Root-associated microbes help plants absorb nutrients and fend off pathogens. The researchers recommend tailoring microbial engineering technologies and developing synthetic microbial communities to optimize these interactions. Properly applied, such microbes could serve as eco-friendly alternatives to pesticides and fertilizers, Wang said.</p><p>He also warned against the long-term damage of monoculture. In one case in April, farmers in Hebei province reported a severe outbreak of bean root rot disease after 15 years of continuous monocropping, with roots turning from white to black. Wang recommended traditional practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, cover cropping and organic fertilization to counteract the buildup of host-specific pathogens and restore positive plant-soil feedback.</p><p>Real-world application of the study's principles has already yielded results.

This conference is seen as a key moment to resolve one of the world's worst humanitarian tragedies. It is expected to be convened by Ambassador Philemon Yang, president of the United Nations General Assembly. But success will depend on more than speeches; it must lead to real, lasting action. </p><p>The Rohingya people, mostly Muslims, have suffered for years. About 1 million fled to Bangladesh after violent attacks in 2017. Another 600,000 remain in Myanmar, living in poverty and fear. They have been denied citizenship and basic rights. Many face food shortages, forced military recruitment and other atrocities. Their future remains uncertain. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

There, Bangladesh's Chief Adviser, Muhammad Yunus, called for global action. A UN resolution followed, and Bangladesh has since played a key role. </p><p>Myanmar's internal situation has only worsened. Since a military coup in 2021, more than 6,000 civilians have died. According to a local monitoring group, about 22,000 people have been jailed for political reasons. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/video/asia/3304322/powerful-magnitude-77-earthquake-strikes-myanmar-buildings-sway-and-fall-bangkok\">A major earthquake in March this year</url> brought no pause to the violence. Civil war continues, and the military junta refuses to step back. Amid the chaos, the Rohingya are more vulnerable than ever. </p><p>To succeed, the conference must meet four urgent goals. First, it must set a clear and enforceable plan for the Rohingya to return home safely and with dignity. This means deadlines, international oversight and strong guarantees. </p><p>Second, it must solve the root problem: the Rohingya must be recognised as citizens of Myanmar. Without legal rights, no return will be meaningful. </p><p>Third, aid must reach those still in Rakhine state. Countries like China and Asean members must help ensure humanitarian access. </p><p>Fourth, the international community must pressure Myanmar's military.

Following a successful pilot at Alexandra House, which earned the Industry Excellence Award for best practice, the IFMCT has been scaled to Charter House and Exchange Square, demonstrating its adaptability. With proven results, Hongkong Land is now preparing to roll out the platform across its entire Central Portfolio by 2026. <br/><br/>Mr Michael Smith, Chief Executive, Hongkong Land, said:\" This pioneering initiative stands as a testament to Hongkong Land's leadership in delivering forward-thinking sustainable solutions, highlighting the Group's long-standing culture of innovation and our commitment to creating lasting value for all our stakeholders. We're proud of the platform's success in Hong Kong and look forward to extending its impact across our regional portfolio.\" <br/><br/>The IFMCT unifies over 20 standalone building systems into a single platform - integrating the Building Management System (BMS), AI-driven Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC), thermal comfort control, energy optimisation, and soft services such as cleaning, vendor management, procurement and tenant wellness monitoring. By leveraging real-time monitoring, advanced AI analytics, and 4D digital twin visualisation, the advanced system enhances operational efficiency and minimises disruptions, improving reliability and extending asset lifecycles. <br/><br/>The IFMCT drives operational excellence, accelerating decarbonisation efforts through close collaboration with tenants <br/><br/>The IFMCT automates workflows to optimise both hard and soft services, improving daily building operation as well as tenant experience. Shifting from traditional, reactive maintenance to a predictive, proactive model, the platform harnesses AI-powered health analytics to detect early signs of performance decline, preventing service interruptions. <br/><br/>For instance, Air Handling Units (AHUs) are managed like people: healthy units skip routine check-ups, while symptomatic ones receive priority servicing. This condition-based approach resulted in a 16% reduction in AHU maintenance effort after one year, cutting maintenance frequency from monthly to biannual, clearly demonstrating the tangible benefits of intelligent servicing. Other measurable outcomes include a 66% automation rate for work orders, and an 80% reduction in time needed to retrieve asset documentation. The platform has significantly decreased the volume of alarm monitoring calls to both tenants and vendors, streamlining communication. <br/><br/>As climate resilience takes on greater urgency, the IFMCT elevates the adaptability of buildings and operations through intelligent energy management. The platform balances energy demand and adjusts heating and cooling systems in response to forecasted weather patterns, helping Hongkong Land and its tenants reduce energy consumption and accelerate decarbonisation efforts. <br/><br/>Hongkong Land to scale the IFMCT regionally following successful pilot and Central Portfolio expansion <br/><br/>The IFMCT's standardised data structure enables seamless integration across markets, supporting Hongkong Land's regional expansion of intelligent property management solutions towards the ultra-premium integrated commercial properties strategy. Building on its success in Hong Kong, the platform is set to be deployed at Westbund Central in Shanghai, a development offering high-quality retail spaces, office towers, residences, hotels, and arts and cultural venues.

The 63.9-million-U.S.-dollar World Bank-supported Jurisdictional Sustainable Landscape Program, involving the purchase of verified emission reductions, will be implemented over a seven-year period in the eastern part of the country. </p><p>Minister of Green Economy and Environment Mike Mposha said the launch of the program demonstrates the government's commitment to transforming the eastern part of the country into a comprehensive low-carbon rural development model that combines forest protection with the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices. The minister noted that despite the eastern part of the country being endowed with vast forests, abundant agricultural land, and rich wildlife, the forests are facing challenges such as illegal encroachment, deforestation, and uncontrolled charcoal production. \"This program is expected to play a crucial role in bringing the Zambian government's vision into reality and serve as a model for shaping and influencing national and provincial policies related to forest conservation, land use, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable natural resource management and carbon trading,\" he said. According to the minister, the generated and verified emission reductions will be traded as certified carbon credits to international carbon buyers to generate monetary benefits that will be distributed to the local communities, motivating them to better manage their natural resources. World Bank Country Manager for Zambia Achim Fock said the key component of the program is to develop robust, verified carbon crediting programs that will unlock new resources for climate financing and adopt a holistic approach to address land use dynamics. He said the initiative is the largest carbon farming project in Africa that integrates agriculture and forestry with a comprehensive landscape approach. Sam Waldock, acting British high commissioner to Zambia, said Zambia will reap additional rewards for its efforts in forest conservation, climate-smart agriculture, and other activities through the sale of carbon credits. He said Zambia is facing many challenges due to climate change, emphasizing the urgent need to adapt to climate change through economic transformation, including agricultural reforms and enhanced natural resources management.

The global average surface air temperature in June was 16.46 degrees Celsius, 0.47 degrees above the 1991-2020 average for the month and 1.3 degrees higher than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial level, C3S said in its monthly bulletin.

For Selma Andreas, a resident of a remote village in the Oshana region in northern Namibia, radio has become an essential tool in navigating her agricultural activities and livelihoods. </p><p>\"Radio has been my hope for a way out,\" the 47-year-old said Friday. In rural areas like hers, farmers depend on radio broadcasts for weather forecasts to supplement their traditional knowledge. For Andreas, this medium has been crucial for her new farming season. \"I learned how to make organic compost from plant residue and crop stalks, as we have limited cattle to produce enough manure, which we relied on in the past,\" she said. Radio programs also guide her in managing her crops. \"It rained yesterday. I had to work harder the day before to prepare my field before the weeds outgrow my crops, especially if the soil becomes too wet to work on,\" Andreas said. For her, Kati FM, an indigenous-language radio station under the Namibia Broadcasting Corporation, has been instrumental in enhancing her agricultural knowledge. Andreas is not alone in her reliance on radio broadcasts. Hilda Shilongo, a 50-year-old resident from the Oshikoto region, northern Namibia, also turns to radio to guide her farming practices. Three years ago, she tuned into a radio program where an agronomic official discussed how farmers could use improved seeds, weeding techniques, and proper post-harvest handling to ensure quality pearl millet grains that meet market standards. She applied these methods the following year and saw a noticeable improvement in her harvest. Since then, she has continued listening to agricultural programs on the radio to enhance her knowledge. Agatus Timo, an 87-year-old farmer from the Oshana region with over 50 years of farming experience, has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including droughts, floods, and pests. Thanks to radio programs, Timo has gained valuable knowledge which has eased the burden of climate challenges. According to him, beyond weather reports, radio also assists rural residents in accessing national services. \"It lets us know exactly where to get seeds and other agricultural services, such as government-subsidized plowing with tractors,\" he said. The benefits of radio extend beyond farming. Aram Martin, councilor for Oshakati West Constituency, highlighted the crucial role radio plays in informing residents about drought relief distribution dates, which are critical to sustaining livelihoods. Following a devastating drought last year, Namibia declared a state of emergency on May 22, 2024. According to John Mutorwa, Namibian deputy prime minister, the government has since rolled out emergency drought relief, benefiting about 1.4 million people. According to the Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia, the country has about 40 broadcasting licensees, including public, commercial, and community radio stations, which play a vital role in bridging the information gap for rural farmers, helping them adapt to climate change and secure their livelihoods.

In an interview with Xinhua on the sidelines of the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP15) underway in the resort city of Victoria Falls in the Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe, Krijger acknowledged China's efforts in wetland preservation, following the accreditation of nine more Chinese cities as wetland cities at COP15 on Thursday. \"Indeed, if you look across the world, China has taken a leadership position in doing the right thing for wetlands,\" he said. </p><p>\"The biggest number of wetland cities in the world is in China, and leading the COP, having these mangrove centers, and having strong policies already in place, and big restoration actions, so I think China is leading.\" China is home to a significant portion of the world's important wetlands, which highlights the importance of the country's efforts in investing in wetland preservation. \"Through the trade relations that China has, and the investments that China has all over the world, (China) is also connected to (other) very important wetlands worldwide,\" Krijger said. COP15, which officially opened on Thursday, is running under the theme of \"Protecting Wetlands for Our Common Future,\" bringing together representatives of governments to strengthen international commitments for wetland conservation and to highlight the vital role of wetlands in sustaining ecological health, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Krijger said platforms such as the Ramsar Convention must continue to amplify the need to preserve wetlands and enhance mutual learning. The Ramsar Convention, named after the Iranian city of Ramsar where the convention was signed in 1971, is an intergovernmental agreement dedicated to the conservation and rational use of wetland ecosystems. Krijger said that Wetland International, a global not-for-profit organization dedicated to the conservation and restoration of wetlands, has worked with China in supporting wetland preservation efforts for many years. \"It is really important that any country steps up and takes their wetlands seriously. Wetlands are easy targets for all kinds of developments, such as real estate and harbors. So strong legislation and strong policies are very much needed to counteract the attractiveness of wetlands,\" he said. \"I think we can learn a lot from the Chinese efforts and bring that to the rest of the world. And also, we could perhaps be facilitating exchange and joint learning across our network,\" Krijger said. While development is welcome, he said, there is a need to maintain a balance between development and the health of wetlands. \"This is a key challenge because, on the one hand, people want to live near or in wetlands because of the water and all the benefits it brings. At the same time, if the development is not done in the right way, that will diminish, at least in the long run, but sometimes even in the short run.\" Krijger said he is eager to visit Chinese wetland cities in the future to learn how they achieve urban development while reaping the benefits of preserving the wetlands.

While much of this has centred on maritime security, the elevation of ties to a strategic partnership offers scope for more comprehensive collaboration. </p><p>Manila and New Delhi share concerns over the uncertainties in the US-China relationship and the increasingly transactional economic policies of US President Donald Trump. On the one hand, the US has been pushing India to halt Russian oil imports, bringing the tariff rate on the country to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3321146/trumps-50-tariff-sows-total-mistrust-between-us-india\">50 per cent</url>.

Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>How the US and China recalibrate their ties will affect how other players navigate Indo-Pacific geopolitics. Therefore, it is crucial for India and the Philippines to continue exploring ways to broaden their cooperation. In which areas can the two countries maximise their strategic partnership? </p><p>First, the Marcos administration anchors its security partnerships on the recently implemented Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept, which prioritises territorial defence of the archipelago and the security of its surrounding waters, along with the interlinked maritime zones of the Western Pacific. The Philippines thus places great importance on its security partnership with India. </p><p>India has supported the Philippine defence modernisation programme and self-reliant defence posture initiative. While initial defence agreements revolved around exporting systems such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3318809/india-gets-global-buyer-interest-brahmos-missile-asia-south-america\">BrahMos supersonic cruise missile</url>, emphasis must also be placed on defence industrial base cooperation, shipbuilding and joint production. </p><p>Second, both sides should consider cooperating on steel production. Steel is vital to defence modernisation. However, as China dominates the steel export market, it may result in embargoes during political crises, thus making supply lines vulnerable to pressure. While the Philippines is the world's second-largest nickel producer, India is among the top steel producers (including of military-grade steel), with several nickel processing sites. </p><p>With Manila encouraging India to explore the nickel trade, it may be helpful to involve Japan, another major steel producer, in a trilateral working group, as New Delhi and Tokyo have already established a bilateral steel dialogue mechanism. By pooling resources, all three countries can create a more sustainable and alternative supply chain for steel. </p><p>Third, another key area for collaboration is in the space sector. Among the outcomes of Marcos' visit to Delhi was the statement of intent between the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Philippine Space Agency on cooperation in outer space. As an archipelago, the Philippines faces challenges relating to the nexus between food security, climate change and maritime domain awareness. Satellite development and the use of space-based assets are crucial to developing early warning systems in case of natural disasters, monitoring the movement of fish, improving fishery management and cultivating climate resilience. </p><p>India's indigenous space programme has excelled over the years and become a credible source of assistance to several nations. Since 2014, India has launched satellites for 34 countries, including the US, Canada and France. India can provide the Philippines with satellite-launching services and pursue a joint production programme for operation-specific satellites. </p><p>Fourth, the Philippines and India can explore more bilateral mechanisms to address specific issues. Among them would be the protection of overseas Filipino workers. </p><p>The Philippines is the top provider of seafarers, and most Filipino seafarers traverse the Indian Ocean. Because of an increase in piracy activities and attacks by <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2023/0217_villar1.asp\">Houthi militants</url>, the security dynamics of this maritime space has become increasingly perilous. As a result, ships that are targeted or hijacked often carry Filipino crew members. </p><p>India is a leading responder to such threats across the Indian Ocean. Given the Philippines' limited capacity, it would be practical to devise a coordination framework with India for quick action and assistance as security conditions are likely to be exacerbated by conflicts in the Middle East. </p><p>Fifth, with direct flights commencing this year, along with the Philippines granting Indian tourists visa-free entry and India granting Filipino tourists free e-visas, the Philippines and India must maximise this enhanced connectivity to facilitate more consistent civil society-to-civil society cooperation, particularly among academics and experts. </p><p>The two countries held their first Track 2 dialogue on maritime security cooperation in Manila in September 2023. The second Track 2 on security cooperation was only held two years later in Jakarta. Moreover, Track 1.5 cooperation remains absent. Enhanced connectivity should be directed towards expanding such collaborations. </p><p>The timing of the elevation of the strategic partnership between the Philippines and India is not only practical but also crucial amid the growing uncertainties of Indo-Pacific geopolitics.

According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 41,000 wildfires have burned nearly 3 million acres as of late July -- well above the 10-year average. Major blazes include Oregon's megafire engulfing over 95,000 acres, California's Madre Fire burning more than 80,000 acres, and Arizona's White Sage Fire scorching approximately 58,000 acres.<br/>These crises unfold amid significant cuts to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) workforce. A Reuters investigation found the agency lost around 5,000 employees -- roughly 15 percent of its workforce -- in just five months due to buyouts and early retirements. Field reports suggest that the loss of support staff forced some firefighters into administrative roles and contributed to supply shortages on the front lines.<br/>The Trump administration also sought to cut funding for NASA's Earth science programs, including satellite missions critical to wildfire monitoring and environmental response. Although Congress restored much of this funding, Science magazine and other observers noted that the repeated attempts to reduce funding have created long-term uncertainty for climate data continuity and fire risk planning.<br/>SOARING DEFICIT<br/>Despite these cutbacks, the Trump administration has aggressively pursued its \"Big and Beautiful\" infrastructure agenda -- spotlighting border walls, highways, and rural broadband expansion. Significant funding has reportedly been authorized for select projects, though many remain underfunded or stalled.<br/>This surge in spending coincides with declining federal revenues and ballooning deficits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a 1.9 trillion dollar deficit in fiscal year 2025 -- approximately 6.2 percent of GDP -- and pegs federal debt held by the public at nearly 100 percent of GDP this year, expected to surpass post-World War II highs by 2027. Over the next decade, cumulative deficits are expected to reach 21 trillion dollars, with public debt climbing to 122 percent of GDP by 2034.<br/>Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the service reached nearly 99 percent of its goal to hire over 11,300 firefighters by mid-July -- on par with last year's levels. USFS Chief Tom Schultz has mobilized all \"red-carded\" wildfire personnel and will rehire some with buyout offers.<br/>However, New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich criticized the sweeping buyouts and temporary rehiring of probationary USFS staff, calling the approach \"gutting\" the service.

WORSE WILDFIRE SEASON The 2025 wildfire season ranks among the most active on record. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 41,000 wildfires have burned nearly 3 million acres as of late July -- well above the 10-year average. Major blazes include Oregon's megafire engulfing over 95,000 acres, California's Madre Fire burning more than 80,000 acres, and Arizona's White Sage Fire scorching approximately 58,000 acres. </p><p>These crises unfold amid significant cuts to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) workforce. A Reuters investigation found the agency lost around 5,000 employees -- roughly 15 percent of its workforce -- in just five months due to buyouts and early retirements. Field reports suggest that the loss of support staff forced some firefighters into administrative roles and contributed to supply shortages on the front lines. The Trump administration also sought to cut funding for NASA's Earth science programs, including satellite missions critical to wildfire monitoring and environmental response. Although Congress restored much of this funding, Science magazine and other observers noted that the repeated attempts to reduce funding have created long-term uncertainty for climate data continuity and fire risk planning. SOARING DEFICIT Despite these cutbacks, the Trump administration has aggressively pursued its \"Big and Beautiful\" infrastructure agenda -- spotlighting border walls, highways, and rural broadband expansion. Significant funding has reportedly been authorized for select projects, though many remain underfunded or stalled. This surge in spending coincides with declining federal revenues and ballooning deficits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a 1.9 trillion dollar deficit in fiscal year 2025 -- approximately 6.2 percent of GDP -- and pegs federal debt held by the public at nearly 100 percent of GDP this year, expected to surpass post-World War II highs by 2027. Over the next decade, cumulative deficits are expected to reach 21 trillion dollars, with public debt climbing to 122 percent of GDP by 2034. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the service reached nearly 99 percent of its goal to hire over 11,300 firefighters by mid-July -- on par with last year's levels. USFS Chief Tom Schultz has mobilized all \"red-carded\" wildfire personnel and will rehire some with buyout offers. However, New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich criticized the sweeping buyouts and temporary rehiring of probationary USFS staff, calling the approach \"gutting\" the service. Firefighter groups report firefighters continue to fill non-fire roles such as answering phones, cleaning toilets, mowing lawns and further straining operations. POLICY PARADOX As the United States faces one of its most severe wildfire seasons in years, experts warn against a troubling disconnect in federal policy. Despite escalating wildfire risks driven by climate change, critical funding for firefighting and climate science has been reduced even as infrastructure spending surges. This imbalance threatens the nation's ability to protect communities and ecosystems effectively. With frontline firefighting capacity shrinking amid soaring expenditures, emergency readiness and fiscal stability are both at risk. Analysts caution that failing to invest adequately in fire prevention jeopardizes not only today's safety but also the country's long-term resilience.

In automated workshops, tempered glass undergoes precision coating processes where ion beams deposit functional materials, creating single-atom-thick radiative cooling films. Already adopted by Xiaomi and Apple, the technology is expanding to other Chinese brands.<br/>The product's foundation lies in decade-long research by Professor Zhu Jia and his team at Nanjing University's School of Sustainable Energy and Resources. This breakthrough came in 2019, when they developed new materials capable of regulating heat through a process known as radiative cooling.<br/>\"Effective cooling requires minimizing energy absorption while maximizing emission,\" explained Zhu Bin, an associate professor on the team. Their engineered films achieve passive cooling through high infrared emission within the atmospheric window spectrum.<br/>Photo shows the main building of Moguang New Energy, a thermal management company based in Suzhou High-tech Zone, east China's Jiangsu province.<br/>The innovation quickly attracted industry attention. In 2021, Xiaomi approached the researchers to explore applications in mobile electronics, where effective thermal management is increasingly critical. As smartphones integrate advanced AI chips and boost processing power, overheating risks (causing overheat, system lag, or even shutdowns) have escalated significantly.<br/>Encouraged by laboratory results, the team decided to commercialize the technology. With support from Nanjing University and the Suzhou High-tech Zone, they launched Moguang New Energy in 2022 to bring the technology to the market. But turning a lab prototype into a commercial product proved far more complex than anticipated.<br/>\"In the lab, we focused on improving cooling performance. But in the real world, we had to balance over 120 technical specifications to meet customer needs,\" Zhu Bin recalled. What they initially expected to take two months instead led to a grueling six-month journey, as they grappled with the \"impossible triangle\" of performance, stability, and affordability.<br/>To overcome these challenges, the team adopted a three-pronged approach.<br/>First, they continued advancing the core technology on their pilot production line. Second, they established a joint laboratory, backed by the university and local government, which brought together experts in materials science, optics, and polymers. Collaborating with suppliers, they addressed technical bottlenecks such as adhesive reliability and lamination techniques. Third, by fine-tuning automation and adjusting material formulations, they raised the film's production yield from 50 percent to over 90 percent, significantly cutting costs.<br/>Moguang New Energy's radiative cooling technology is adopted on Dagu Glacier in southwest China's Sichuan province, as part of the efforts to slow glacial melt.<br/>After more than 40 iterations, a commercially viable radiative cooling film featuring great performance, stability, and affordability was successfully applied to a new Xiaomi smartphone model in 2023, marking a major step toward large-scale commercialization.<br/>\"Moguang New Energy now operates three production lines and continues to scale up,\" said Zhu Bin. Four smartphone brands have partnered with the company. The company's electronic-grade cooling film orders have exceeded 70 million yuan ($9.74 million). Applications beyond electronics are also expanding: building coatings, cold-chain logistics, and solar systems account for another 30 million yuan in orders. The company is preparing to launch textile-grade films suitable for sun-protective clothing and tents, with mass production expected to begin soon.<br/>Together, these product lines target trillion-yuan markets in electronics, construction, and apparel, with further expansion planned into aerospace. The company expects revenue to surpass 100 million yuan this year.<br/>Beyond commercial applications, the technology is also playing a role in climate resilience. Since 2022, Moguang New Energy has applied its radiative cooling technology to glacier preservation efforts on Dagu Glacier in southwest China's Sichuan province. \"Early results show an 80 percent reduction in melting in pilot areas, with projections indicating potential net growth in glacier volume within three to five years,\" Zhu Bin noted.</p>", "publisher": "People's Daily Online - English", "instances": ["Together, these product lines target trillion-yuan markets in electronics, construction, and apparel, with further expansion planned into aerospace.

The plan was unveiled Wednesday in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and the Rwanda Green Fund (RGF), in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). It lays out a strategic roadmap to raise awareness, develop an investment pipeline, provide technical assistance, and implement supportive policies. \"This CSA Investment Plan aligns with Rwanda's Fifth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation, which aims to accelerate agricultural transformation through increased climate resilience, productivity, market access, and private sector investment,\" said Mark Cyubahiro Bagabe, minister of agriculture and animal resources, at the launch. </p><p>Bagabe underscored the plan's goal of attracting private capital to help make agriculture more productive, climate-resilient, and sustainable, adding that the CSA-IP provides a platform for mobilizing investment and strengthening regulatory support for climate-smart agricultural practices. In the long term, the plan aims to mainstream and scale climate-smart agriculture by unlocking new funding sources, expanding investment opportunities, and driving policy reforms, according to a statement issued by the ministry. The ministry noted that approximately two-thirds of the total investment opportunity lies in water supply and irrigation infrastructure. Additional areas include climate-resilient crop cultivation, post-harvest loss reduction, sustainable livestock development, and enhanced soil health. Teddy Mugabo, chief executive officer of the RGF, said that the plan enables better coordination, attracts private-sector capital, and delivers results that are measurable, scalable, and impactful for both farmers and the environment. Rwanda's agriculture sector is a cornerstone of the economy and food security but remains highly vulnerable to climate risks such as erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, rising temperatures, and soil erosion. These challenges threaten both crop yields and livestock productivity, jeopardizing rural livelihoods, according to the statement. The plan targets the transformation of approximately 83,250 hectares into climate-resilient, high-productivity farmland through efficient irrigation, improved soil management, and high-yield crops. It also aims to connect around 170,200 farmers and 375 agribusinesses to climate-smart financing through bankable investment projects. \"This plan provides a national-level strategic framework to prioritize private sector-oriented climate-smart agriculture investment opportunities, identify financing mechanisms, and propose key actions for the government to achieve meaningful impact,\" said Jiyeon Janice Ryu, IFC resident representative for Rwanda.

It marks a departure from the fossil-fuel-based industrial system that has driven economic growth since the 18th century.</p><p>As such, it requires long-term government planning, public investment, policies to encourage private investments, and the political will to override the status quo. Capitalist markets alone cannot deliver this transformation. They were never designed to.</p><p>This is where many economies are struggling. The idea that markets will drive the energy transition simply because solar and wind have become \"cheaper\" than coal and gas nowadays is misleading and too simplistic.</p><p>While the cost per unit of renewable electricity generation may be low, renewable projects face structural obstacles in monetizing those savings.</p><p>Energy markets are designed around fossil fuels and were never intended to handle decentralized, intermittent, and zero-marginal-cost energy. The result is a mismatch between what the planet urgently needs and what the market is willing to finance.</p><p>In economies where electricity has been \"marketized\" under the assumption that private competition would yield efficiency and innovation, things are moving slowly because electricity isn't like smartphones or coffee shops. It is essential infrastructure, and a complex web of regulations, incumbent interests and unpredictable market volatility governs its pricing and distribution.</p><p>Renewable developers often struggle to secure stable revenues without government guarantees. And as subsidies are withdrawn, assuming the market will now take over, investment slows.</p><p>China's rapid deployment of renewable energy, on the other hand, is not primarily driven by the market. It reflects a strategic decision by the State to prioritize energy security, industrial competitiveness, and climate resilience.</p><p>The Chinese government plans well in advance, directs capital through State-owned banks, and utilizes industrial policy to expand domestic supply chains. It doesn't leave the energy transition to chance or the \"market\".</p><p>That's not to say there are no vested interests in China \u2014 of course there are. Fossil-fuel companies, provincial-level governments with primary interests in fossil fuels, and bureaucratic inertia are very real obstacles.</p><p>However, China's political system appears better equipped to manage and balance these interests in the service of national and global objectives. When the government signals a central pivot, such as its commitment to peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, resources are aligned to make it happen on a long-term basis.</p><p>This contrasts sharply with the political paralysis that often characterizes other economies. In the US, for example, climate policy is subject to election cycles, partisan gridlock, and legal challenges. One administration may support clean energy, while the next may roll it back, which is what is happening today under the Trump administration. Investors hesitate, and infrastructure projects stall. The result is inconsistency and delay.</p><p>This is not an argument for socialism, nor a dismissal of liberal democracy. Instead, it is a call to recognize that the energy transition requires strong, consistent governance over decades, spanning electoral cycles and administrations.</p><p>Governments must not only provide funding and regulatory support but also assume the role of coordinator-in-chief by aligning infrastructure, permitting, financing and conducting research and development. This is a public mission that cannot be subject to the whims of the market.</p><p>The irony is that many of the tools needed to accelerate decarbonization already exist \u2014 technology, know-how, capital and so on. What's missing is the political clarity and institutional architecture to deploy them at the necessary speed and scale.</p><p>China's example demonstrates that when a government treats the energy transition as a national imperative, rather than a market experiment, the results follow. Of course, China is not without challenges. Its emissions remain high, coal still plays a significant role because energy security is vital, and local implementation varies. The development of artificial intelligence is also a huge energy guzzler. But the direction of travel is clear, and it is setting the pace for the rest of the world.</p><p>The Chinese model is also not without inefficiencies. A key challenge has been overbuilding renewable energy generation before adequate transmission and usage infrastructure is in place. This mismatch has led to curtailment, resulting in wasted clean energy that cannot reach users, and highlighting coordination gaps even in a State-led system. Meanwhile, the pricing of electricity and the profit-and-loss performance of power companies, whether State-owned or private, remains unstable. Earnings, including those of solar manufacturers, can fluctuate significantly because of regulatory adjustments, pricing controls, policy changes, and cutthroat competition. Such volatility is rugged for the market alone to withstand, and it discourages international investors who struggle to make sense of a system that doesn't conform to conventional financial logic.</p><p>Yet, despite these shortcomings, China continues to push ahead. That, too, reveals something fundamental: Decarbonization is not a tidy, market-optimized path. It is a messy but urgent revolution, and success depends on a state's ability to coordinate, absorb risk, and stay the course. The US and other economies must not only catch up in capacity but also rethink their operating assumptions.</p><p>The 21st-century energy system cannot be built on 20th-century practices. If we want a livable planet, governments everywhere must abandon the myth that markets alone will deliver decarbonization. The alternative is not just ecological failure. It could well lead to economic decline and even geopolitical irrelevance. China has understood this.

In Gaza today, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3319992/gaza-worst-case-scenario-famine-food-crisis-experts-warn\">starvation is weaponised</url>. Children are orphaned and forced to breathe toxic smoke from burning oil refineries; farmers till land riddled with depleted uranium; generations are condemned to water poisoned by munitions and chemicals. War is not a finite event. Its devastation ripples on, bringing slow-motion environmental ruin that haunts communities long after the guns fall silent. </p><p>Tragically, contemporary climate debates are reduced to corporate slogans, \"net zero\" fairy tales and performative guilt over individual carbon footprints. Western leaders feign concern for islands at risk of submersion even as they ignore the military-industrial complex's colossal environmental and climate damage. The machines of destruction roll on, enriching the merchants of death with every bomb manufactured, sold and detonated. </p><p>The global war industry profits directly as innocents pay the ultimate price, the environment is devastated and future generations inherit a toxic world. The systematic exclusion of military emissions from \"environmental, social and governance\" (ESG) reporting is not mere negligence; it is deliberate complicity, orchestrated by powerful capital market actors closely linked to the war industry. The public is kept in the dark. This is not just a blind spot; it is a calculated deception. </p><p>Let's not pretend the ESG industry is a reluctant accomplice. It is designed to distract from the war industry's role, obsessing over the impact of coffee cups while ignoring militaries' unchecked consumption of fossil fuels and the destruction of cities. The greatest climate criminals wear suits, not uniforms, yet no UN summit dares challenge them. </p><p>A few weeks ago the Global Institute for Tomorrow hosted a groundbreaking virtual conference, \"The War on Climate: Unveiling the Uncounted Costs of Conflict\", exposing the deliberate exclusion of conflict emissions by the military-industrial complex, often aided by governments too captive to resist. </p><p>As nations ramp up military budgets, it becomes clear that the world is preparing not for peace, but for more conflict, in a damning indictment of systemic failures and warped priorities. Rare moments of global cooperation, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/389407/what-kyoto-protocol\">the Kyoto Protocol</url>, have been undermined by cynical loopholes. The US insisted on exempting military emissions from the agreement. Thus, one of the most carbon-intensive activities on Earth was given a free pass. </p><p>The result? Emissions continue to rise, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3320801/record-heat-grips-japan-turns-vietnam-pan-fire\">along with global temperatures</url>. When it comes to military emissions, only a handful of countries even attempt to report them; of these, only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/germany\">Germany</url> has done so with any rigour. But that may change soon as it vastly increases military spending and becomes more active in wars. The rest mostly fudge, obscure, or ignore the numbers. The same nations that dominate climate summits spend 30 times more on their militaries than on climate action - a telling glimpse of their true priorities. </p><p>International bodies like the UN aid and abet this duplicity. Military emissions are often misclassified as those from \"bunker fuels\" - a technicality that excludes them from national tallies. Worse still, under current reporting, if one nation bombs another, the emissions are counted against the victim, not the aggressor. Such sleight of hand reveals the calculated hypocrisy behind the global military build-up. </p><p>These manipulations matter. Officially, military activities account for 6 per cent of global emissions, or a staggering 2.53 billion tonnes per year. This figure dwarfs the emissions of entire continents: military emissions exceed Russia's or even Africa's total output. One US Abrams tank burns a year's worth of car fuel in a single day. Meanwhile, citizens are gaslit into using paper straws, their carbon savings a rounding error next to the military's unchecked pollution. </p><p>The reality is likely far worse. Dr Soroush Abolfathi, a panellist at the Global Institute for Tomorrow conference, estimates that actual conflict emissions could be 10 times higher, contributing 15-20 per cent of global emissions. Yet ESG institutions and the UN erase this from climate policy. That's not an oversight; it's collusion with ecocide. </p><p>The myth that military emissions begin and end with active conflict is a dangerous fiction. Preparation for war - building bases, moving equipment, maintaining fleets - leaves a vast carbon footprint. The US operates more than 750 military bases worldwide, yet reports none of their emissions. Its \"war on terror\" has produced more CO  annually than Sweden or Norway combined. Even after the bombs stop falling, the reconstruction pumps even more carbon into the atmosphere - 16 billion tonnes, mostly from cement, ensuring war's toxic legacy lingers for generations. </p><p>To treat lofty net-zero targets and peace as separate aspirations would be a fatal error. The military's contribution to climate change will only amplify the crisis' worst effects. History shows that those with power and resources will adapt; the marginalised will be displaced, stripped of assets and forced to migrate. Climate migration is no longer a hypothetical - it is a present reality. Peace and climate justice are inseparable from the fight against poverty and inequality. </p><p>While the world obsesses over individual carbon footprints, militaries - the elephant in the climate room - operate in the shadows, protected by the very institutions that have been charged with saving our planet. We must demand transparent reporting, genuine accountability for conflict emissions and a redirection of military spending towards climate resilience. </p><p>It's high time these so-called defence forces actually defended something worth protecting: our collective future, not just lines on a map.

With approximately 285,200 hectares of wetlands, Yueyang has stepped up its conservation efforts in recent years and was officially recognized as an international wetland city at this year's COP15. <br/><br/><br/><br/>A total of nine Chinese cities won the prestigious title during the meeting, bringing the total number of such cities in China to 22, the highest in the world, showcasing the country's significant achievements in wetland conservation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>According to China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China currently boasts 56.35 million hectares of wetlands, ranking fourth in the world. It is also home to 82 Wetlands of International Importance and five national parks. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Yan Zhen, deputy head of China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said during the meeting that in recent years, China has continuously improved its legal and institutional framework for wetland conservation, comprehensively protected wetland ecosystems, and actively engaged in international cooperation, continuously contributing to global wetland protection efforts. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Over the last 20 years, China has made significant progress in wetland conservation, marking a turning point that has led to a more balanced and sustainable relationship between humans and nature,\" Yan said. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Shining example  <br/><br/><br/><br/>China became a party to the Ramsar Convention in 1992 and hosted COP14 in 2022, during which it was elected as chair of the standing committee to lead the convention process for the following three years. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In an exclusive interview with Xinhua during COP15, Musonda Mumba, secretary general of the Convention on Wetlands, said she assumed the role six weeks before the opening of COP14 and felt \"very fortunate\" to start the journey with China. \"China has provided leadership in making sure that all the draft resolutions made at COP14 were dealt with and delivered in a timely manner.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/>China's Wetland Protection Law, effective since June 2022, is the country's first dedicated legislation on wetlands, providing a comprehensive legal framework for wetland conservation, restoration, management and sustainable use. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Hailing the law as a \"shining example\" to the world, Mumba said, \"China is one of the very few countries that actually have a wetland law. And that for me is also incredibly impressive, because not only does the law talk about having inventory, having the right data, managing these wetland systems, it also talks about the role of cities and why these cities matter.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/>The success in wetland conservation has not only benefited China's biodiversity, but also contributed to the health of cross-border ecosystems by integrating wetland protection with other environmental goals, such as migratory bird conservation, she noted. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, China's efforts to raise awareness have sparked a significant increase in global interest in wetland conservation over the past years, she added. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Indeed, if you look across the world, China has taken a leadership position in doing the right thing for wetlands,\" Coenraad Krijger, CEO of Wetlands International, a global not-for-profit organisation, told Xinhua on the sidelines of COP15. <br/><br/><br/><br/>He applauded China for its leading role in the global wetland preservation agenda, noting that China's status as a major investment partner in the world makes it a key player in safeguarding the health of wetland ecosystems. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Through the trade relations that China has, and the investments that China has all over the world, (China) is also connected to (other) very important wetlands worldwide,\" Krijger said. <br/><br/><br/><br/>While development is welcome, there is a need to maintain a balance between development and the health of wetlands, he said, adding that he is eager to visit Chinese wetland cities in the future to learn how they achieve urban development while reaping the benefits of preserving the wetlands. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Unwavering commitment<br/><br/><br/><br/>In many rapidly developing regions of Africa, urban expansion has taken a toll on wetlands, a growing issue that communities and policymakers are striving to address. <br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Wetlands International's Director for East Africa Julie Mulonga, many African countries have policies in place to protect wetlands, but there is a lack of investment in implementation measures. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Local communities and indigenous knowledge play a crucial role in effectively driving wetland conservation efforts, she said, adding that China's wetland management experience could provide a valuable reference and its advanced technology could go a long way in helping the continent achieve green development. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Over the years, China has been actively supporting many African countries in wetland governance through legislative exchanges, technical training and talent development, helping enhance their ability to restore and preserve wetlands. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Wetlands are crucial for ecological resilience, and their future hinges on unwavering international cooperation, said Xia Jun, director general of the International Cooperation Department at China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration. \"This profound understanding underpins China's unwavering commitment to its conservation.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/>In 2024, China launched the International Mangrove Center (IMC) in the southern city of Shenzhen to promote global mangrove conservation, sustainable use and international cooperation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Xia described the IMC as a landmark initiative that reflects the spirit of global cooperation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>With the support of the IMC, the Mangrove Conservation Foundation, a private foundation based in China, has been carrying out programs in African countries such as Madagascar and Kenya to help preserve mangroves, which are vital coastal ecosystems along the continent's shorelines, Sun Lili, co-founder and executive board chair of the foundation, told Xinhua. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Christine Colvin, Freshwater Policy Lead, WWF International, said: \"This COP is really important in terms of setting goals for the next period, for the next decade, and the strategic plan for the contracting parties to Ramsar, and it prioritises international cooperation.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/>Colvin said that China is demonstrating to municipalities and local governments around the world how to bring nature back into cities and design new urban areas that are more permeable, allowing the natural water cycle to function. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Commending China for leading the way in this field, the WWF official said they are looking forward to continuing cooperation with China to boost global efforts to preserve wetlands and build more permeable sponge cities.</p>", "publisher": "Beijing Review", "instances": ["Significant

From building the world's largest number of international wetland cities to achieving legislative breakthroughs and forging capacity-building partnerships with other countries, China has embraced a comprehensive approach to wetland protection, deeply rooted in ecological civilization and its unwavering support for global efforts. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS At the height of summer, deep within the East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve in central China's Yueyang city, Hunan province, schools of fish swim freely in the lake, deer bound through the forests, and birds sing joyfully among the trees. \"We are proud to say that the wetlands are now the ecological calling cards of Yueyang,\" said Yu Ge, a representative of the city who attended COP15 in the resort city of Victoria Falls in the Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe. The COP15, themed \"Protecting Wetlands for Our Common Future,\" brought together government representatives to strengthen international commitments to wetland conservation and to highlight the vital role of wetlands in sustaining ecological health, biodiversity and climate resilience. </p><p>Yu actively promoted Yueyang at every event during his short stay in Zimbabwe, warmly inviting participants from different countries to explore the city. With approximately 285,200 hectares of wetlands, Yueyang has stepped up its conservation efforts in recent years and was officially recognized as an international wetland city at this year's COP15. A total of nine Chinese cities won the prestigious title during the meeting, bringing the total number of such cities in China to 22, the highest in the world, showcasing the country's significant achievements in wetland conservation. According to China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China currently boasts 56.35 million hectares of wetlands, ranking fourth in the world. It is also home to 82 Wetlands of International Importance and five national parks. Yan Zhen, deputy head of China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said during the meeting that in recent years, China has continuously improved its legal and institutional framework for wetland conservation, comprehensively protected wetland ecosystems, and actively engaged in international cooperation, continuously contributing to global wetland protection efforts. \"Over the last 20 years, China has made significant progress in wetland conservation, marking a turning point that has led to a more balanced and sustainable relationship between humans and nature,\" Yan said. SHINING EXAMPLE China became a party to the Ramsar Convention in 1992 and hosted COP14 in 2022, during which it was elected as chair of the standing committee to lead the convention process for the following three years. In an exclusive interview with Xinhua during COP15, Musonda Mumba, secretary general of the Convention on Wetlands, said she assumed the role six weeks before the opening of COP14 and felt \"very fortunate\" to start the journey with China. \"China has provided leadership in making sure that all the draft resolutions made at COP14 were dealt with and delivered in a timely manner.\" China's Wetland Protection Law, effective since June 2022, is the country's first dedicated legislation on wetlands, providing a comprehensive legal framework for wetland conservation, restoration, management and sustainable use. Hailing the law as a \"shining example\" to the world, Mumba said, \"China is one of the very few countries that actually have a wetland law. And that for me is also incredibly impressive, because not only does the law talk about having inventory, having the right data, managing these wetland systems, it also talks about the role of cities and why these cities matter.\" The success in wetland conservation has not only benefited China's biodiversity, but also contributed to the health of cross-border ecosystems by integrating wetland protection with other environmental goals, such as migratory bird conservation, she noted. Moreover, China's efforts to raise awareness have sparked a significant increase in global interest in wetland conservation over the past years, she added. \"Indeed, if you look across the world, China has taken a leadership position in doing the right thing for wetlands,\" Coenraad Krijger, CEO of Wetlands International, a global not-for-profit organisation, told Xinhua on the sidelines of COP15. He applauded China for its leading role in the global wetland preservation agenda, noting that China's status as a major investment partner in the world makes it a key player in safeguarding the health of wetland ecosystems. \"Through the trade relations that China has, and the investments that China has all over the world, (China) is also connected to (other) very important wetlands worldwide,\" Krijger said. While development is welcome, there is a need to maintain a balance between development and the health of wetlands, he said, adding that he is eager to visit Chinese wetland cities in the future to learn how they achieve urban development while reaping the benefits of preserving the wetlands. UNWAVERING COMMITMENT In many rapidly developing regions of Africa, urban expansion has taken a toll on wetlands, a growing issue that communities and policymakers are striving to address. According to Wetlands International's Director for East Africa Julie Mulonga, many African countries have policies in place to protect wetlands, but there is a lack of investment in implementation measures. Local communities and indigenous knowledge play a crucial role in effectively driving wetland conservation efforts, she said, adding that China's wetland management experience could provide a valuable reference and its advanced technology could go a long way in helping the continent achieve green development. Over the years, China has been actively supporting many African countries in wetland governance through legislative exchanges, technical training and talent development, helping enhance their ability to restore and preserve wetlands. Wetlands are crucial for ecological resilience, and their future hinges on unwavering international cooperation, said Xia Jun, director general of the International Cooperation Department at China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration. \"This profound understanding underpins China's unwavering commitment to its conservation.\" In 2024, China launched the International Mangrove Center (IMC) in the southern city of Shenzhen to promote global mangrove conservation, sustainable use and international cooperation. Xia described the IMC as a landmark initiative that reflects the spirit of global cooperation. With the support of the IMC, the Mangrove Conservation Foundation, a private foundation based in China, has been carrying out programs in African countries such as Madagascar and Kenya to help preserve mangroves, which are vital coastal ecosystems along the continent's shorelines, Sun Lili, co-founder and executive board chair of the foundation, told Xinhua. Christine Colvin, Freshwater Policy Lead, WWF International, said: \"This COP is really important in terms of setting goals for the next period, for the next decade, and the strategic plan for the contracting parties to Ramsar, and it prioritises international cooperation.\" Colvin said that China is demonstrating to municipalities and local governments around the world how to bring nature back into cities and design new urban areas that are more permeable, allowing the natural water cycle to function. Commending China for leading the way in this field, the WWF official said they are looking forward to continuing cooperation with China to boost global efforts to preserve wetlands and build more permeable sponge cities.

It commits nations to urgent, science-guided multilateral action to conserve and sustainably use the oceans. According to the French Foreign Ministry, about 100 countries are represented at the Nice conference, including over 50 national leaders. </p><p>A much larger turnout than at the two previous editions, in New York in 2017 and Lisbon in 2022, demonstrated a \"very strong commitment made by countries\" to take action, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Despite being a key player in global ocean governance, the United States limited its presence at the UNOC3 to only \"technical and working level\" delegates. Notably, no U.S. scientists participated in the One Ocean Science Congress (OOSC), held just ahead of the UNOC3. The congress brought together more than 2,000 researchers worldwide to debate and formulate scientific input for policymakers. Several expected participants from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were absent due to recent layoffs in federal agencies, a result of sweeping budget cuts by the Trump administration. According to the French National Centre for Scientific Research, co-organizer of OOSC, NOAA is facing a 25 percent funding reduction for fiscal year 2025, with over 1,500 staff either laid off or pushed into early retirement. In light of the U.S. withdrawal from several key international commitments, including the Paris Agreement and the pandemic accord negotiations, Emmanuel Macron, president of UNOC3-host country France, said he was not surprised. \"Should that stop us from moving? No!\" He declared, reaffirming France's dedication to the ocean agenda. \"Multilateralism\" has been a key word at the Nice conference. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose country will host the next COP on climate change, warned against the dangers of unilateralism. \"Today, the threat of unilateralism hangs over the ocean. We cannot allow what has happened to international trade to happen to the ocean,\" he said. A report in the British journal Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution noted that the absence of U.S. scientists at the UN conference poses \"severe disruptions to operational forecasts, data assimilation and international collaboration\" in ocean studies and conservation efforts. The current U.S. policy direction is \"undermining the ocean science and multilateral cooperation that are essential for marine conservation, sustainable resource management and climate resilience globally,\" affecting \"progress on Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water) and the broader global ocean agenda,\" the report said. Despite the U.S. stepping back, the UNOC3 adopted a final declaration that stresses the critical importance of basing ocean action on \"the best available science and knowledge.\" Edward Allison, principal scientist at the WorldFish Center, urged the United States to reconsider its approach.

The interim dividend will be paid on Thursday, 25 September 2025. As at the date hereof, the Company does not hold any treasury shares whether in the Central Clearing and Settlement System, or otherwise.</p><p>PROSPECTS</p><p>Strong Resilience in Challenging Times</p><p>Business Review</p><p>In a changing economic landscape marked by heightened uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions, the Group continued to maintain stringent financial discipline and a prudent management philosophy. The expansion of its social infrastructure portfolio and its recent investments in several infrastructure and utility assets increased the diversification and resilience of its recurring income base. The Group remains focused on strengthening the quality of its balance sheet, assets and earnings to generate long-term sustainable growth and stable returns for shareholders.</p><p>Property Sales</p><p>The residential property market in Hong Kong remained challenging during the first half of 2025. The Hong Kong Government announced a reduction of stamp duty for certain properties in the beginning of 2025 and mortgage interest rates fell during the period, but market sentiment remained cautious. On the Mainland, the Central Government promulgated plans to support real estate demand and stimulate consumption.</p><p>The Group maintained a proactive and market-focused sales strategy during the period. The sale campaigns for Blue Coast and Blue Coast II in Wong Chuk Hang, The Greenwich in Beijing, Noble Hills in Guangzhou, and Emerald Cove in Huizhou have progressed steadily. The pre-sale for Victoria Blossom at Kai Tak is expected to be launched in the second half of 2025.</p><p>The Group recorded an increase in property sales revenue but a decrease in contribution when compared with the same period in 2024. It included profit contributions from The Coast Line in Yau Tong, Regency Garden in Shanghai, and The Greenwich in Beijing. The profit contribution from Perfect Ten in Singapore is expected to be recognised when contracted sales are completed in the second half of 2025. The Group will continue with its prudent strategy on land bank replenishment in assessing prime sites for future development.</p><p>Property Rental</p><p>The retail and commercial property sector in Hong Kong remained weak in the first half of 2025. Contributions from the Civitas social infrastructure portfolio in the UK alleviated the prevailing market challenges in Hong Kong. The Group recorded a modest decrease in revenue and contribution from property rental during the period when compared with the same period in 2024. An active marketing and leasing campaign has been launched for Cheung Kong Center II, the Group's latest flagship Grade A office building, which enjoys a strategic location in Central and a panoramic view of Victoria Harbour.</p><p>Hotel and Serviced Suite Operation</p><p>The Hong Kong Government and industry leaders stepped up efforts to support and implement various initiatives to promote the tourism sector. The sector faced ongoing cost pressures and a decline in average room rates, despite a rise in both visitor arrivals and overnight visitors in the first half of 2025. The Group's hotel and serviced suite operation recorded a mild increase in revenue but a slight decrease in contribution when compared with the same period in 2024. The Group will continue to focus on optimising the business and its hotel and serviced suite portfolio in line with market demand to maximise revenue income streams from both hotel visitors and long-stay guests. The hotel and serviced suite operation is committed to embracing digital transformation and innovation to improve operational efficiency and elevate the guest experience.</p><p>Pub Operation</p><p>Market conditions for the pub sector in the UK remained tough with an uncertain outlook for the hospitality industry compounded by higher annual cost pressures from the UK Government's budget measures and changing drinking and social habits. During the period, Greene King's pub operation remained stable and recorded an increase in revenue and contribution when compared with the same period in 2024 despite continuing headwinds. Pub culture is an integral part of the British way of life and the industry has shown resilience amid economic pressures. With the support of the Group and a portfolio of excellent freehold properties and strong brands that showcase its rich heritage, Greene King is committed to deliver on its recent investments in new digital capabilities to enhance market share and customer spend to secure long-term growth.</p><p>Infrastructure and Utility Asset Operation</p><p>The infrastructure and utility assets operation recorded a solid increase in revenue and contribution during the period when compared with the same period in 2024. The Group's growing portfolio is anchored by businesses in the regulated utilities segment and the contracted infrastructure segment, which consistently provide stable and recurring income. The revenues and asset bases of these businesses are resilient to changes in macroeconomic conditions including inflation, and are protected against high interest rates given prudent gearing. For businesses in the regulated utilities segment, the allowed cost of debt is also periodically adjusted to reflect the actual prevailing interest rates, which mitigates interest rate risk.</p><p>In July 2025, a joint venture between the respective wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, CK Infrastructure Holdings Limited, Power Assets Holdings Limited and CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, agreed to dispose of its entire interests in Eversholt UK Rails. The Company has an indirect interest of 20% in the joint venture. The transaction will allow the joint venture to unlock the underlying value of the asset. Completion of the transaction, which is expected to take place in a few months, is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions under the sale and purchase agreement.</p><p>Sustainability Initiatives</p><p>The World Meteorological Organization has confirmed that 2024 was the warmest year on record. As the severity and frequency of extreme weather events increase, the Group recognises the importance of stepping up the sustainability and climate resilience of its operations and value chain. In December last year, the Group's near-term and net-zero targets were validated by the SBTi. In May this year, SBTi approved Greene King's 2040 net-zero target and re-verified its near-term target to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. As part of its decarbonisation commitment, the Group will accelerate efforts to implement its net zero transition plan. In its upcoming 2025 sustainability report, the Group aims to enhance the transparency of its sustainability reporting with a view to early compliance with the new mandatory climate-related disclosure requirements of the HKEX ESG Code, which is in line with the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures.</p><p>As a conglomerate with property development as one of its key business activities, the Group's decarbonisation initiatives include pragmatic sustainable building practices and green building design. During the period, it received several important green building accreditations. Notably, Cheung Kong Center II received a final platinum rating under BEAM Plus New Buildings (V2.0). Perfect Ten, a luxury residential development by the Group, was honoured with the Best Apartment/Condominium Development award in Singapore at the 2025-2026 Asia Pacific Property Awards. These accolades underscore the Group's commitment to sustainable development and environmental stewardship.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>The global economic landscape has become increasingly complex and uncertain. Ongoing geopolitical conflicts, policy shifts and trade tensions continue to shape the direction of investment, business growth and consumer confidence. The Mainland recorded a positive real GDP year-on-year growth of 5.3% in the first half of 2025 with improved economic indicators. China continues to be a key leader and contributor to global economic growth. The Central Government's recent measures to stabilise the real estate sector, boost consumption, and pursue strategic advances in technological innovation, advanced manufacturing and the green transition, are part of its broader efforts to bolster the economy.</p><p>Hong Kong reported a year-on-year real GDP growth of approximately 3% in the first half of 2025. The city has elevated its global competitiveness and attracted international capital and high-calibre talent. Hong Kong stands to benefit from its unique position as a super-connector between the Mainland and the world, and the strong support of the Central Government to maintain its role as an international financial, trade and shipping centre. The Hong Kong Government has introduced various measures to support the real estate market and improve investor sentiment. Housing and land policies and interest rate movements will continue to be determining factors for the property market.</p><p>The Group, as a multinational conglomerate, continues to prioritise a resilient and well diversified portfolio of high-quality investments and assets in its core strategy. It is well-positioned to cope with any unforeseen challenges with a proven track record of navigating effectively through market turbulence with caution. The Group remains committed to pursue long-term business growth and provide stable shareholder returns. It has the ability to draw on the strength of its balance sheet and low gearing ratio to invest in quality assets globally that generate recurrent income in line with its investment and sustainability strategies.</p><p>As at 30 June 2025, the Group had a net debt to net total capital ratio of approximately 5.0%. The Group has maintained \"A/Stable\" and \"A2 Stable\" credit ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's respectively, demonstrating its stable financial profile.</p><p>Acknowledgement My colleagues on the Board join me in thanking our team of diligent employees around the world for their hard work, adaptability and contributions during the period.

It is also home to 82 Wetlands of International Importance and five national parks.Yan Zhen, deputy head of China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said during the meeting that in recent years, China has continuously improved its legal and institutional framework for wetland conservation, comprehensively protected wetland ecosystems, and actively engaged in international cooperation, continuously contributing to global wetland protection efforts.\"Over the last 20 years, China has made significant progress in wetland conservation, marking a turning point that has led to a more balanced and sustainable relationship between humans and nature,\" Yan said.SHINING EXAMPLEChina became a party to the Ramsar Convention in 1992 and hosted COP14 in 2022, during which it was elected as chair of the standing committee to lead the convention process for the following three years.This photo taken on July 22, 2025 shows a herd of yaks in a wetland near Mapam Yumco Lake in Burang County of Ngari Prefecture, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Tenzing Nima Qadhup)In an exclusive interview with Xinhua during COP15, Musonda Mumba, secretary general of the Convention on Wetlands, said she assumed the role six weeks before the opening of COP14 and felt \"very fortunate\" to start the journey with China. \"China has provided leadership in making sure that all the draft resolutions made at COP14 were dealt with and delivered in a timely manner.\"China's Wetland Protection Law, effective since June 2022, is the country's first dedicated legislation on wetlands, providing a comprehensive legal framework for wetland conservation, restoration, management and sustainable use.Hailing the law as a \"shining example\" to the world, Mumba said, \"China is one of the very few countries that actually have a wetland law. And that for me is also incredibly impressive, because not only does the law talk about having inventory, having the right data, managing these wetland systems, it also talks about the role of cities and why these cities matter.\"The success in wetland conservation has not only benefited China's biodiversity, but also contributed to the health of cross-border ecosystems by integrating wetland protection with other environmental goals, such as migratory bird conservation, she noted.Moreover, China's efforts to raise awareness have sparked a significant increase in global interest in wetland conservation over the past years, she added.\"Indeed, if you look across the world, China has taken a leadership position in doing the right thing for wetlands,\" Coenraad Krijger, CEO of Wetlands International, a global not-for-profit organisation, told Xinhua on the sidelines of COP15.He applauded China for its leading role in the global wetland preservation agenda, noting that China's status as a major investment partner in the world makes it a key player in safeguarding the health of wetland ecosystems.\"Through the trade relations that China has, and the investments that China has all over the world, (China) is also connected to (other) very important wetlands worldwide,\" Krijger said.While development is welcome, there is a need to maintain a balance between development and the health of wetlands, he said, adding that he is eager to visit Chinese wetland cities in the future to learn how they achieve urban development while reaping the benefits of preserving the wetlands.UNWAVERING COMMITMENTIn many rapidly developing regions of Africa, urban expansion has taken a toll on wetlands, a growing issue that communities and policymakers are striving to address.This photo taken on Nov. 27, 2023 shows little swans resting at a wetland in Yueyang City, central China's Hunan Province. (Photo by Cao Zhengping/Xinhua)According to Wetlands International's Director for East Africa Julie Mulonga, many African countries have policies in place to protect wetlands, but there is a lack of investment in implementation measures.Local communities and indigenous knowledge play a crucial role in effectively driving wetland conservation efforts, she said, adding that China's wetland management experience could provide a valuable reference and its advanced technology could go a long way in helping the continent achieve green development.Over the years, China has been actively supporting many African countries in wetland governance through legislative exchanges, technical training and talent development, helping enhance their ability to restore and preserve wetlands.Wetlands are crucial for ecological resilience, and their future hinges on unwavering international cooperation, said Xia Jun, director general of the International Cooperation Department at China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration. \"This profound understanding underpins China's unwavering commitment to its conservation.\"In 2024, China launched the International Mangrove Center (IMC) in the southern city of Shenzhen to promote global mangrove conservation, sustainable use and international cooperation.Xia described the IMC as a landmark initiative that reflects the spirit of global cooperation.With the support of the IMC, the Mangrove Conservation Foundation, a private foundation based in China, has been carrying out programs in African countries such as Madagascar and Kenya to help preserve mangroves, which are vital coastal ecosystems along the continent's shorelines, Sun Lili, co-founder and executive board chair of the foundation, told Xinhua.Christine Colvin, Freshwater Policy Lead, WWF International, said: \"This COP is really important in terms of setting goals for the next period, for the next decade, and the strategic plan for the contracting parties to Ramsar, and it prioritises international cooperation.\"Colvin said that China is demonstrating to municipalities and local governments around the world how to bring nature back into cities and design new urban areas that are more permeable, allowing the natural water cycle to function.Commending China for leading the way in this field, the WWF official said they are looking forward to continuing cooperation with China to boost global efforts to preserve wetlands and build more permeable sponge cities.

This collaboration prioritizes long-term, mutually beneficial economic partnerships rooted in Africa's own sustainable development goals, contrasting with conditional or extractive models.</p><p>Key implications are that China-Africa green cooperation offers developing nations a credible, demand-driven alternative pathway to modernization and energy security, reducing reliance on traditional global governance prescriptions. It provides an alternative to Western dominance in setting global development norms by showcasing a model built on respect for national aspirations, pragmatic technology transfer and shared green growth. Successfully navigating project complexities provides valuable experiences, strengthening the model's legitimacy and offering the Global South greater leverage in choosing development partners aligned with their sovereignty and environmental priorities.</p><p>China's collaborative green energy ventures in Africa provide a powerful, positive counter-model to the traditional governance supremacy. By delivering tailored solutions that meet both developmental and environmental needs on mutually beneficial terms, China empowers other Global South nations with a practical, sustainable alternative pathway, reshaping development dynamics and asserting its positive role through demonstrable action and partnership.</p><p>The author is former commissioner of the Federal Civil Service, director of the Civil Service Reform Program in Ethiopia, and a deputy CEO of Ethiopia Sugar Corporation.

Anaclaudia Rossbach, executive director of UN-Habitat, said that sustainable urbanization is an imperative to help secure a more equal, cohesive and green future for humanity. \"Our mandate of enabling inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable urbanization has become increasingly clear and recognized,\" Rossbach told the opening plenary of the third Open-Ended Meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives (OECPR-3) in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. </p><p>A precursor to the resumed second session of the UN-Habitat Assembly, slated for Thursday, the OECPR runs from Monday to Wednesday to discuss themes that are likely to shape the future for cities and their inhabitants. Rossbach said that during the three-day OECPR meeting, delegates, including senior policymakers, diplomats, representatives of civil society, industry and academia, will assess progress toward realizing a new urban agenda, rooted in universal access to basic services such as housing, clean water and sanitation. In addition, Rossbach said, the meeting will pay attention to planetary warming that has taken a toll on cities, worsening displacement, loss and damage, especially in the Global South. Tapping into forward-looking leadership, smart policies, technologies and innovations will be key to realizing the eleventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11) that lays emphasis on sustainable cities and communities, Rossbach said. She said that full implementation of the UN-Habitat's strategic plan covering 2026-2029, which focuses on housing, land and basic services, will hasten urban renewal, while tackling social and ecological challenges facing city dwellers. According to Rossbach, the global liquidity crisis, coupled with rapid geopolitical shifts, calls for innovative ways to finance activities aimed at realizing the sustainable urban agenda. The multilateral system should be reformed, entrenching meritocracy, leveraging technology to boost efficiency and improving governance to secure a green and resilient future for rapidly growing cities, she said. In the past year, UN-Habitat delivered significant impacts across more than 100 countries through expanding access to clean water, adequate housing, advancing climate resilience and supporting recovery in conflict-affected settings, Rossbach said. \"These efforts reflect our commitment to inclusive and sustainable urban transformation, and leaving no one behind,\" she said.

Its popularity is testament to both the convening power of the event, which is taking place from Tuesday to Thursday in north China's Tianjin Municipality, and the unparalleled magnetism of China's mega-scale market. Also called the 16th Annual Meeting of New Champions of the World Economic Forum (WEF), this year's forum is themed \"Entrepreneurship for a New Era.\" \"The theme, which builds on the DNA of this meeting since its inception, particularly focuses on how innovation, entrepreneurship and technological advancements can unlock growth, competitiveness and productivity,\" Mirek Dusek, managing director of the WEF, said on Tuesday at the forum's opening press conference. </p><p>The event spotlights five key areas: deciphering the world economy, outlook on China, industries disrupted, investing in people and the planet, and new energy and materials. Unlike the annual meeting of the WEF held every January in Switzerland's Davos, the Summer Davos Forum places greater emphasis on the future of business and technological advancement. This year's edition not only demonstrates China's achievements in high-quality economic development and its steadfast commitment to high-standard opening-up to the international community -- it is also a platform for China to actively share the opportunities and dividends of its development with the world. GREEN TRANSFORMATION On the rooftop of the National Convention and Exhibition Center (Tianjin), where the 2025 Summer Davos Forum is being held for the first time, solar panels supply continuous clean energy to power the venue during the event. According to the State Grid Corporation of China, this edition of the forum has achieved a 100 percent green power supply for its venues, utilizing a total of 800,000 kilowatt-hours of renewable electricity -- equivalent to saving about 300 tonnes of standard coal combustion and cutting approximately 600 tonnes of carbon emissions. The venue utilizes photovoltaic power generation and sponge city technologies, replacing conventional energy sources with renewables to reduce infrastructure carbon emissions, while significantly enhancing energy, water and material efficiency. Sustainability is at the core of WEF events, said Severin Podolak, head of event management and operations for WEF, adding that the sofas and other furniture used in the venues are recycled materials from 2023, and some of the paints used for decoration were derived from renewable resources such as fishing nets. Additionally, a fleet of hundreds of new energy vehicles (NEVs) from six leading carmakers, including Audi FAW, are facilitating eco-conscious transportation for forum participants, advancing the event's carbon neutrality goals. The concept of sustainability has been integrated thoroughly -- from venue design to the forum's agenda, with key topics such as Asia's carbon markets and the next steps for climate resilience becoming focal points of discussions, addressing sustainable development directly. Green nitrogen fixation has been named in the WEF's Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025, alongside innovations like collaborative sensing and autonomous biochemical sensing, further solidifying sustainability as a global priority. Today, China stands as the global leader in renewable energy investment. The nation has pioneered transformative technologies in the fields of batteries and electric vehicles, creating millions of high-quality jobs in these future-oriented sectors, according to Gim Huay Neo, managing director of the WEF. \"I think this is an area where there's a lot of scope for us to learn from China's experience, where there could actually be constructive partnerships between China and other parts of the world to also support the global energy transition,\" Neo said. \"The climate emergency and the planetary crisis cannot be resolved if we do not bring everybody along on this journey.\" AI REVOLUTION A futuristic exhibition zone at the venue has become a major attraction, where cutting-edge AI products like humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces and fully autonomous drone inspection systems are drawing large crowds of attendees. These innovations vividly showcase Chinese enterprises' technological breakthroughs and pioneering applications of AI. \"China may have found the key to restarting global economic growth -- its 'AI Plus' strategy,\" said Liu Gang, chief economist of the Chinese Institute of New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Strategies. He explained that integrating artificial intelligence with the real economy yields remarkable economic benefits. For example, research conducted by his team shows that applying AI to the development of new materials can improve efficiency 100-fold to 1,000-fold. Across various sessions at the 2025 Summer Davos, discussions on AI are unfolding with remarkable intensity, mirroring the fervent debates witnessed at other premier global forums. Notably, a dedicated session titled \"Understanding China's approach to AI\" will be convened, underscoring the international community's growing recognition of China's pivotal role in the global AI development landscape. \"It will be like the industrial revolution,\" former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said when talking about new technologies at the forum. Countries that embrace it go up, and countries that don't go down, he said. \"I think how you understand, master and harness the technology revolution solution is the single biggest government challenge for the 21st century,\" he noted. GLOBAL SYNERGY According to the WEF, the global growth outlook has reached its lowest point in decades. Reigniting the spirit of cooperation will require greater commitment and creativity than ever before. Professor Tong Jiadong at Nankai University, who has served as the long-term Chinese agenda research leader for the Tianjin Summer Davos Forum, observed that the event has evolved beyond a premier global thought leadership summit into a dynamic platform facilitating international exchange and cooperation. Zhao Yan, chairman and general manager of Chinese firm Bloomage Biotech, has been a regular participant at the Summer Davos Forum. Over the years, the company has established a comprehensive global supply chain network across over 70 countries and regions. \"Despite navigating complex uncertainties, the enterprise has never resorted to isolationism, but instead strives to reshape global competition rules through open innovation,\" Zhao said. In the first five months of this year, the total volume of China's imports and exports of goods grew 2.5 percent year on year, and the consumption enthusiasm of foreign visitors surged significantly. \"We value our cooperation with China very much. We're seeing more and more interest and participation coming here,\" said Borge Brende, president and CEO of the WEF. \"I'm relatively optimistic for the Chinese economy, both in medium term and long term.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["Sustainability is at the core of WEF events, said Severin Podolak, head of event management and operations for WEF, adding that the sofas and other furniture used in the venues are recycled materials from 2023, and some of the paints used for decoration were derived from renewable resources such as fishing nets.

The new AI model, trained on seven years of high-resolution global satellite data, assesses fire risk by analyzing multiple factors, including lightning strikes, vegetation density, weather patterns, and topography. A key finding is that lightning-induced wildfires behave differently from human-caused ones, highlighting the need for specialized approaches tailored to each fire type. Moreover, the study reveals that climate change is accelerating the risk of lightning-driven fires.

In parallel, the UN has announced an ambitious biodiversity framework to be achieved by 2030. Hong Kong, itself, is striving to re-assert itself as a maritime powerhouse. This alignment, the authors propose, creates an unprecedented opportunity to transform the city into Asia's sustainable blue economy leader. At the heart of this transformation lies 'Port 2.0' \u2013 a visionary reimagining of Hong Kong's waters as a multifunctional interface that connects sea, land, city, technology and people, and serve as platforms for innovation, environmental stewardship and civic life. <br/><br/>\"What makes this moment truly extraordinary is how these elements intersect with Hong Kong's unique advantages. Our world-class financial ecosystem can mobilise the billions needed for maritime decarbonisation. Our strategic location positions us as the natural hub for green shipping business in Asia. And our existing port infrastructure provides the ideal testing ground for innovative solutions.\" said Christine Loh, Chief Development Strategist, Institute for the Environment at HKUST and author of the paper \"From Port 1.0 to Port 2.0: Hong Kong's Next Leap to Evolving a Blue Economy Vision\". <br/><br/>Hong Kong's status as the world's third-largest capital hub gives it unmatched potential to pioneer blue finance. As ADMCF's Blue Finance report highlights, instruments such as blue bonds can mobilise capital to facilitate port decarbonisation, sustainable aquaculture and marine eco-tourism\u2014transforming the city into Asia's premier blue economy hub, aligning marine protection with economic prosperity. In 2023 there was a surge in blue bonds followed by continued growth in 2024, and Asia was the largest issuing region\u2014led by China. <br/><br/>\"If Hong Kong were to issue blue bonds, this would not only signal the city's commitment to improving its status as a leading international maritime hub but also accelerate the growth of blue finance, ensuring a future where economic prosperity and marine resilience go hand in hand,\" said Kate Martin, the report's lead author and sustainable finance consultant with ADMCF. <br/><br/>This untapped potential aligns with the groundbreaking research in Valuing the Invaluable Blue. The WWF-commissioned study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences has, for the first time, quantified the staggering monetary value of the Greater Bay Area's coastal ecosystems\u2014revealing a Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) worth RMB 4.9 trillion, equivalent to over 35% of the GBA's GDP, with 73% contributed by marine ecosystems. <br/><br/>\"This valuation demonstrates our marine ecosystems' critical, yet often overlooked, economic contributions,\" said Lydia Pang, Head of Oceans Conservation at WWF-Hong Kong. \"From climate regulation to disaster mitigation, these natural systems provide services worth over one-third of our regional GDP - services that should be factored into development decisions and anchor blue economy planning,\" she said. \"What's more, our study shows that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to adopt this ecosystem accounting framework. With strong data foundations, policy alignment, and technical readiness, we can localise and institutionalise marine GEP accounting to guide planning, investment, and conservation.\" <br/><br/>The authors' combined focus on a blue economy vision integrates port development with marine conservation, biodiversity, climate resilience, recreation and the responsible use of ocean resources. It builds on China's decades of marine policy leadership, where comprehensive frameworks - from ocean GEP systems to blue finance instruments - have laid the foundation for sustainable maritime development. <br/><br/>\"The window to developing a sustainable blue economy and to establish ourselves as the global leader in sustainable maritime commerce is open now, but won't remain so indefinitely.\" Said Sophie le Clue, CEO at ADMCF. \"The question isn't whether we can seize this opportunity, but whether we will.\" <br/><br/>Hashtag: #ADMCapitalFoundation</p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://release.media-outreach.com/release.php/Images/Thumb/400x0/635406/635406-ADM-27May-JPG-400x0.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://release.media-outreach.com/release.php/Images/635406/ADM-27May.JPG\">ADM 27May - Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Media OutReach (English)", "instances": ["\"What's more, our study shows that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to adopt this ecosystem accounting framework.

Wildfires and earthquakes have crumbled priceless temples and monuments, and wars and armed conflicts have turned iconic landmarks into rubble.<br/><br/>Even in the absence of sudden catastrophe, heritage sites face rising threats. Rising seas engulf ancient port cities, while intensifying monsoons erode historic settlements. In China, sections of the Great Wall, built to withstand invaders, now battle desertification and extreme weather. From thawing Arctic permafrost destabilizing indigenous sites to scorching temperatures fading Australia's ancient rock art, no region remains untouched.<br/><br/>Human activities are accelerating the peril. While urbanization and unchecked development have led to encroachment of historic neighborhoods, sprawling infrastructure have fractured cultural landscapes. Even tourism, a vital source of preservation funding, is straining fragile monuments in many UNESCO World Heritage sites.<br/><br/>The loss of heritage is not merely structural; it is the erosion of humanity's legacy. As communities are being uplifted, valuable cultural practices and traditional knowledge disappear, fraying the fabric of human identity, collective memory, and the bonds that unite societies.</p><p>On this International Day for Monuments and Sites (April 18), we are reminded that cultural heritage faces unprecedented threats on a global scale.

This aligns with UNESCO's call to integrate traditional knowledge into climate resilience.</p><p>China's visitor-management innovation, such as time-slot ticketing for the Palace Museum (Forbidden City), has inspired global peers such as Venice in Italy and Machu Picchu in Peru, while embedding heritage into rural vitalization programs has created millions of jobs, lifting communities out of poverty while safeguarding cultural heritage.</p><p>China has also become a key partner in global heritage conservation, sharing expertise through technical and financial assistance. Since 1989, China has been helping Cambodia to restore the Angkor Vat monuments, and since 2015, it has been assisting Nepal to rebuild monuments damaged in the devastating Kathmandu earthquake.</p><p>Through initiatives like the Silk Roads International Youth Forums, China has fostered intercultural dialogue among youths from more than 100 countries, promoting heritage stewardship. Since 2018, China has collaborated with Africa to strengthen capacity building and monitor systems for UNESCO World Heritage sites. China's multilateral cooperation aligns with UNESCO's vision of heritage as a catalyst for international understanding and peace building.</p><p>Today, we celebrate heritage as a bridge \u2014 not merely between past and future, but as a living connection between peoples and nations. In the face of division and destruction, preserving cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, movable and non-movable, becomes an act of hope and a powerful affirmation of the MONDIACULT vision that positions culture at the heart of sustainable development.</p><p>China has shown that through innovation, inclusive vision and global partnership, heritage can thrive as a testament to resilience \u2014 from AI-powered conservation to community-led rural revitalization.</p><p>UNESCO remains committed to strengthening its partnership with China as well as other countries, ensuring our cultural legacies not only endure but illuminate the path forward.

China has exactly those resources in abundance \u2014 along with a strategic interest in exporting its green development model.</p><p>Consider renewable energy technology. Over the years, China has become a leader in solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage.</p><p>Chinese manufacturers have pushed down the cost of solar modules by more than 80 percent in the past decade, making solar power far more accessible. Latin America, blessed with intense sunlight and strong winds, stands to gain enormously from these cheaper technologies. By importing Chinese solar panels or partnering with Chinese companies to build wind farms, countries such as Chile, Mexico and Brazil are expanding their clean energy capacity.</p><p>Chinese expertise \u2014 from ultrahigh-voltage grid design to electric bus manufacturing \u2014 is helping Latin America leapfrog toward modern, low-carbon systems. This tech transfer is often bundled with financing from China's development banks or commercial lenders, creating a one-stop solution for Latin American governments looking to implement green projects quickly.</p><p>There is also a strong social and human dimension to these projects. Latin American leaders are keen that the green transition also be a just transition \u2014 one that creates jobs, reduces inequality and respects local communities. Here, too, China's role can be positive. Many Chinese renewable projects have brought employment and training to local residents, as seen, for example, with the Bahia wind farm's 1,000 jobs in Brazil. And by contributing to cleaner air and water, these collaborations directly improve quality of life.</p><p>To maximize mutual gains, Latin American governments are encouraging Chinese investors to form joint ventures, use local suppliers and transfer skills. When managed well, China's green investments can thus become a catalyst for Latin America's broader sustainable development, aligned with the region's goals of inclusive growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greener partnership</emphasis></p><p>Despite the promising alignment, China's burgeoning role in Latin America's green transition is not without challenges. One major hurdle is navigating the regulatory and political complexities across nations. Each country has its own legal framework, approval process, and standards for environmental and social safeguards. Projects could be delayed or derailed by permission issues, community protests or shifts in government.</p><p>There is also a challenge of aligning priorities. While both sides want sustainable development, Latin American governments often emphasize that it must directly benefit local populations. As noted, reducing inequality is a key concern; green projects are expected to create jobs and social value, not just generate electrons or extract minerals. Building trust through local partnerships, hiring and training local workers and engaging transparently with communities are essential.</p><p>The awareness of this need is growing. Some Chinese investors are currently pursuing joint ventures with Latin companies or sourcing components locally to meet the host country's expectations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sustainable future</emphasis></p><p>As the world races to curb carbon emissions and avert climate catastrophe, the green transformation of LAC has become a matter of global significance. In this endeavor, China's role has emerged as both impactful and indispensable.</p><p>Through sizable investments, technology transfer and a shared vision of progress, China is helping to unlock Latin America's tremendous sustainable development potential. From the windswept plateaus of Argentina to the tropical sun of the Caribbean, solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles financed by Chinese partnerships are accelerating the region's shift to a low-carbon economy. This is happening in a way that aligns with Latin American aspirations \u2014 creating jobs, upgrading industries and fostering inclusive growth.</p><p>Looking ahead, the promise of the China-LAC green alliance is bright. Both sides are doubling down on climate action: China has committed to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, while Latin American nations are pushing forward with renewable-energy expansions and nature-based climate solutions. Their partnership can be a powerful engine driving these commitments from paper to practice.</p><p>The author is director of research at the Institute of Innovative and High-Quality Development (Hong Kong).\u00a0The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily European Edition", "instances": ["Upgrading energy infrastructure, building renewable power capacity, electrifying transport and conserving critical ecosystems demand capital and technology on an unprecedented scale.

As a developing country, why does China still remain committed to cutting carbon emissions?\" This is a question posed by a reader on people.cn.</p><p><br/>Reducing carbon emissions is not undertaken at others' request but is an unwavering commitment China has chosen to pursue.<br/>First, we must discuss what is \"carbon.\" In the context of \"carbon reduction,\" the term \"carbon\" does not refer to the chemical element itself, but to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which contribute to the greenhouse effect. Among these, carbon dioxide is most closely associated with human activities and is thus commonly used as a representative indicator. In everyday language, \"carbon dioxide\" is often abbreviated simply as \"carbon.\"<br/>Why reduce carbon?<br/>Carbon reduction is urgently needed because global warming poses a serious threat to human survival and the continuity of civilization.<br/>The United Nations has repeatedly warned of a direct link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and the growing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, as global warming accelerates. Data from the World Meteorological Organization shows that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with extreme weather events seen in many parts of the world. Compared with the early 2000s, the frequency of record-breaking monthly rainfall in 2024 increased by 27 percent, while the frequency of record-breaking daily rainfall rose by 52 percent, according to Xinhua.<br/>No country is immune to the impacts of global warming. In China, the China Climate Bulletin released by the China Meteorological Administration showed that in 2024, the national average temperature reached 10.9 \u00b0C, the highest since records began in 1951. The number of high-temperature days exceeded the average by 6.6 days, the second-highest since 1961.<br/>Annual precipitation reached 697.7 millimeters, 9 percent above normal levels. Climate-related natural disasters disrupted agricultural production and threatened lives and property.<br/>Beyond climate security, there are also deeper reasons for carbon reduction at both international and domestic levels.<br/>At the international level, carbon reduction is an urgent need for China to take the initiative to shoulder the responsibilities of a major country and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.<br/>Carbon emissions reduction allows China to maintain strategic initiative amid the global shift toward green and low-carbon development. China's decarbonization efforts also assist developing countries in strengthening their climate resilience, thereby contributing to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.<br/>As a key participant, contributor, and leader in advancing global ecological civilization, China plays an active role in international environmental governance and continues to enhance its voice and influence in the global environmental governance system. The country has established the world's largest and most complete new-energy industrial chain. In 2023 alone, China's exports of wind and solar products helped other countries reduce carbon emissions by approximately 810 million tonnes.<br/>Domestically, carbon reduction is conducive to driving China's green and low-carbon transition and ensuring sustainable development. It is conducive to meeting the people's growing demand for a beautiful ecological environment and promoting harmonious coexistence between man and nature.<br/>China has made significant progress in optimizing its energy mix, with significant growth in hydropower, nuclear, wind, and solar power generation. These efforts have contributed not only to lower carbon emissions but also led to a significant decline in PM2.5 and other air pollutants. From 2015 to 2023, the average PM2.5 concentration in prefecture-level cities and above fell by more than 30 percent. From 2013 to 2022, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region saw its GDP grow by 60 percent, while the region's PM2.5 levels dropped by more than 60 percent.<br/>Achieving sustainable devt<br/>Carbon reduction is conducive to solving prominent problems of resource and environmental constraints and achieving sustainable development. China leads the world in total installed capacity of wind, solar, hydro, and biomass energy.<br/>In the past decade, the proportion of coal in China's energy consumption has dropped by 12.6 percentage points. From 2013 to 2023, China's annual economic growth rate of 6.1 percent was supported by an average annual energy consumption growth rate of 3.3 percent. In 2023, renewable energy accounted for approximately one-third of the nation's total electricity consumption.<br/>Carbon reduction is conducive to adapting to the trend of technological progress and promoting the transformation and upgrading of economic structure. China has phased out more than 150 million tons of outdated steel production capacity, completed ultra-low emissions transformation of 134 million tons of steel throughout the process, and built the world's largest, most complete, and most competitive clean energy industry chain. China's output of polysilicon, silicon wafers, battery cells and modules accounts for more than 80 percent of the world's total, and wind turbine manufacturing capacity accounts for 60 percent of the world's total.<br/>This shows that while reducing carbon emissions, development is also achieved. Thinking about why to reduce carbon emissions is essentially exploring how to develop.<br/>The development China pursues is one that meets the people's growing aspirations for a better life and embodies the new development philosophy.<br/>While some countries have backtracked from their carbon reduction commitments, China has remained unwavering. Green development forms the foundation of high-quality development, and carbon reduction is an inherent requirement for promoting high-quality development. While reducing carbon emissions, we are also achieving a shift in our development model.<br/>When the wind from Zhangbei in North China's Hebei Province powers the lights of Beijing, and \"blue skies and starry nights\" become a daily norm, such deep romance and steadfast sense of security are truly captivating.<br/>China's unwavering commitment to carbon emissions reduction is fundamentally driven by China's own desire to upgrade its economic development model, said Li Changan, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at the University of International Business and Economics.<br/>\"The country is shifting away from a resource-intensive and extensive growth approach toward one that is innovation-driven and efficiency-oriented. This transformation naturally brings higher environmental standards, including stricter targets for emission reductions, making decarbonization a strategic necessity,\" he told the Global Times on Monday.<br/>Li noted that China has already built a competitive edge in green, low-carbon, and new-energy sectors, which provides a solid foundation for the country to stay the course on green development and accelerate its low-carbon transition.<br/>Optimizing the energy mix and advancing renewable energy, Li said, are not only vital to supporting green development but also crucial for enhancing national energy security and preserving strategic autonomy.</p>", "publisher": "People's Daily Online - English", "instances": ["At the international level, carbon reduction is an urgent need for China to take the initiative to shoulder the responsibilities of a major country and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

The report was developed to assist multinational corporations identify new manufacturing sites and expand their sales networks to emerging consumers.</p><p>The Oliver Wyman Forum ranked the cities based on consumer activity, access to suppliers and shipping, regional and global transportation connectivity, and climate resilience. Together, the cities represent 45% of global GDP and 85% of the world's population. The study applies proprietary urban research models developed by Oliver Wyman as well as advanced geospatial data gathering.</p><p>\"Sustainable economic growth, climate change and protectionism are prompting corporations to review and reconsider their geographic footprints,\" said Ben Simpfendorfer, lead of the Oliver Wyman Forum initiatives in Asia. \"As a strategic planning tool, this report can help multinationals identify future opportunities and manage risks. Many of these cities will be among the world's largest megalopolises by the end of this decade.\"</p><p>Findings show that Asia has multiple mid-tier cities benefiting from national industrial policy, supply chain shifts, and tourism. These cities account for 79 of the top 100 export centers, including Ho Chi Minh, and many have invested in advanced technologies, such as Shenzhen. Some key Asian export centers are uniquely exposed to climate change, however, owing to a greater number of coastal locations.</p><p>Six Middle East cities rank among the top 50 commercial hubs, with Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh expanding rapidly. Several are aviation hubs with long-haul connections to Asia, Africa and Europe. Moreover, regional companies are increasingly listing on public equity exchanges.

During the World Wildlife Day celebrations, Kenyan officials launched the National Single Species Action Plan for the Grey Crowned Crane.

Firstly, Taking heavy rain and drought as hazards, an evaluation index system of UWSCR is established, including engineering resilience (ENR), ecological resilience (ECR) and evolutionary resilience (EVR). A combination model based on the analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method is used to measure the UWSCR of 27 SC pilot cities and 253 non-pilot cities at or above the prefecture level in China. Secondly, coordinating hazard index and UWSCR index, cities are divided into four types. The results show that the ENR and EVR of SC pilots exhibited an increasing trend from 2010 to 2020 and were greater than those of non-pilots. Among the four types, Resilient Cities and Low Risk Cities with high climate resilience (CR) were mainly distributed in the eastern and central regions of China. High Risk Cities and Vulnerable Cities with low CR were mostly distributed in the central and western regions. Among the cities of high CR, SC pilots accounted for 63.0% of the pilot samples, while non-pilots only accounted for 26.5% of the non-pilot samples. Finally, this paper analyzes the typical cases of SC pilots, and puts forward some suggestions, such as considering the UWSCR systematically and holistically, improving the ECR of UWSCR, making medium-term to long-term adaptation planning and providing differentiated policy support.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The originality of this work is to identify four types of cities from the perspective of UWSCR and provide reference for improving the CR of SCs.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Climate Resilience of Urban Water Systems: a Case Study of Sponge Cities In China.

As the world inches closer to climate tipping points, the Latin American and Caribbean region holds huge untapped potential in not just terrestrial carbon sinks but also pioneering a new financial architecture that rewards environmental stewardship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brazil will host the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Belem in November at a time that is ripe for transformative leadership, giving Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva the chance to emerge as not only a champion of the Global South but also a global climate statesperson.</p><p>The LAC countries have long waited for the developed world to fulfill their climate finance promises. But with the Global North faltering on its financing commitments \u2014 failing to pay the $100 billion per year pledged at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 and likely to do a repeat with the $300 billion promise at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, last year, the LAC countries must chart their shared course.</p><p>By embracing multilateralism, harnessing South-South, bilateral and triangular cooperation, establishing research and development centers, and using innovative carbon finance vehicles such as the proposed Tropical Forest Forever Facility, the region can transform carbon credits into tangible, sustainable development dividends. Under Lula's COP30 presidency, the region has the opportunity to initiate a new era of global carbon financing, proving that tropical forest conservation is an investable class of sovereign asset vital to a fairer and more resilient future.</p><p>If structured efficiently and fully adopted at COP30, the proposed TFFF could serve as a cornerstone of this vision. It has the potential to allow countries with rainforests and sovereign carbon credits \u2014 fully verified under UN mechanisms \u2014 to swap them for concessional finance, invest in green bonds, transfer for compliance or fund domestic climate action initiatives. Such a mechanism not only aligns with Nationally Determined Contributions \u2014 climate action plans submitted by individual countries to the UNFCCC under the Paris Agreement \u2014 but also with performance payments, markets and transparency under the same agreement. It offers the potential to unlock fresh carbon capital where it is most needed.</p><p>Honduras is an early mover in this emerging climate finance space. During Honduran president Xiomara Castro de Zelaya's tenure as president pro tempore of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), Honduras became the first country in the world to post sovereign carbon credits under the UN's Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation framework for 2023, totaling 11.8 million credit units of carbon dioxide, fully compliant with the Paris Agreement for the 2021-23 period.</p><p>These credits represent forest conservation and restoration efforts that have climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development benefits. Honduras now faces a unique opportunity: it could allocate 50 percent of its UN-verified carbon credit revenues to forest preservation, sustainable agriculture and food security programs while securitizing the remaining 50 percent to issue green bonds. These bonds could finance cleaner energy (solar and wind) infrastructure and grid-scale energy storage systems \u2014 a dual investment strategy that combines immediate emissions reductions with long-term climate resilience and energy independence.</p><p>This sovereign carbon strategy, as a smart policy, is replicable across the region as well as the world. Many countries across the region \u2014 from Colombia and Panama to Suriname and the Dominican Republic \u2014 have similar forest assets and climate ambitions. With a scalable framework like the TFFF, carbon finance can evolve from fragmented bilateral deals to a cohesive financial instrument to bridge the monumental climate debt developed countries owe to rainforest nations which have collectively received payments for only 4 percent of the 13 billion tons of CO2 emissions they have removed from the atmosphere over the past 20 years. Hence, pragmatic cooperation is crucial in this regard.</p><p>With the US' withdrawal from the multilateral climate change arena, BRICS, Canada, the European Union and Japan have emerged as natural, dependable partners for LAC countries, offering infrastructure, cleaner energy technologies, and much-needed carbon finance.</p><p>If a fair opportunity cost of $28 per ton of CO2 removed \u2014 less than half the price European polluters pay in the EU Emissions Trading System \u2014 is applied, the Global South would receive $350 billion in exchange for the climate stabilization services it has already rendered. Given the Brazilian ecosystems' critical role in global climate stability and the country's renewed climate leadership under Lula, Brazil is the natural convener for this initiative.</p><p>With regard to South-South cooperation, over the past decade, the China-CELAC Forum has matured into a multidimensional platform, spurring trade, renewable energy projects and joint climate initiatives.</p><p>The path is clear: by leveraging sovereign carbon assets, deepening multilateralism and cooperation, building and improving research and development centers, and using carbon finance to help the LAC countries, we can build a fairer, greener and more vibrant future. In doing so, Latin America and the Caribbean will not just participate in carbon finance; they will lead it.</p><p>The author is former minister of the environment of Panama, regional director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, distinguished adviser to the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, and recipient of Harvard University's Howard T.Fisher Prize in Geographic Information Science.

The framework outlines regional cooperation on a sector projected by the United Nations Development Programme to generate US$3 trillion in economic value and 43 million jobs by the end of the decade. </p><p>\"Within it, of course, the fishery sector is a core sector of development. But [alongside] fisheries, we're also going to be targeting energy, transport, tourism, mining.

UNICEF Representative to China Amakobe Sande, stressed that children must be placed at the center of the international development and cooperation agenda in today's increasingly complex and rapidly, ever-changing world, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2025 in south China's Hainan Province. Children in Asia face overlapping crises including conflict, widening inequality and climate change, Sande said. </p><p>\"These crises erode children's coping strategies, deepen inequalities, and hinder their potential to thrive.\" The Asia-Pacific region is home to a large proportion of the world's children. According to UNICEF, children in this region are disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters, with increasingly frequent and intense storms, floods, droughts, and other environmental hazards. Beyond natural disasters, ongoing conflicts and deepening economic disparities continue to place millions of children at risk, Sande noted, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated international responses. In her interview, the UNICEF representative also highlighted the impact of rapidly evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization. While digitalization presents new opportunities to empower children, she cautioned that the digital divide remains a significant challenge. \"A large percentage of young people in low- and middle-income countries have limited access to digital technologies and difficulty developing digital skills. This impacts their ability to use digital tools in their schools and future workplaces,\" Sande said. To tackle the challenges, UNICEF advocates for strong online regulations, including for AI, to protect children's data, as well as child rights-based design principles to prevent biased or exploitative content. The organization also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive digital literacy programs to empower both children and parents, ensuring that children remain safe and secure in the digital space. Sande also hailed China's impressive gains in reducing child and maternal mortality rates, universal basic education, and poverty alleviation. \"China's successes in child health and development can inspire other countries,\" she said.

ended 31st March, 2022, the Group's revenue decreased by 1% to approximately HK$1,049 million. A profit of approximately HK$357 million was recorded, compared to a loss of approximately HK$99 million last year.</p><p>The performance of the Group during this period was improved mainly due to the disposal of the entire equity interests in Starlite Printers (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd and recorded a net gain of approximately HK$483 million. However, the appreciation of Renminbi by approximately 4%, the exchange loss recorded, and the sharp rise in major commodity prices, logistics and labour-related costs in the period have affected the overall performance.</p><p>The global economy seemed to be on a path of recovery during the reporting period; however, the macro environment fluctuated sharply in the second half of the year. Except for the once-in-acentury COVID-19 pandemic and the mutation of the highly contagious Omicron virus strain that swept the world, the global supply chain continued to suffer from uninterrupted disruptions, the geopolitics in Eastern Europe was unstable, the development prospects of different economies showed a trend of differentiation, and the inflation in the United States and Europe has risen to the highest level in more than 40 years, all of which greatly increased the operational difficulties and pushed up the operating costs of enterprises. Given the unprecedented shock to the global economy, the performance of the four plants in the PRC was varied during the period. The Guangzhou and Shaoguan plants suffered from a loss, while the Shenzhen plant has recorded a one-off gain upon the completion of the equity transfer. On the other hand, the Suzhou plant actively seized the opportunities from market recovery and recorded an increase in sales and a turnaround from loss to profit.</p><p>July 17 2023: STARLITE: ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT FY2022/2023</p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>Pursuant to Appendix 27 Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide (the \"Guide\") of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the \"Stock Exchange\"), Starlite Holdings Limited (the \"Company\"), together with its subsidiaries (the \"Group\" or \"we\") hereby present this Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Report to report ESG issues that have key environmental and social impacts and are relevant to the business of the Group for the year ended 31st March, 2023 (the \"Financial Year\"). Unless otherwise stated, the reporting period is from 1st April, 2022 to 31st March, 2023.</p><p>Source: HongKong Stock Exchange</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 4, 3827 words </p><p>July 27: Starlite Holdings : Chairman's Statement</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>For the year ended 31st March, 2025, the Croup's revenue increased by 7.3% to approximately HK$895 million. A loss of approximately HK$27 million was recorded, compared to a profit of approximately HK$17 million last year.</p><p>Benefitting from the rebound in market demand driven by the easing of global inflationary pressures and interest rate cuts, the Croup recorded a moderate grow/th in revenue for the year; however, as the increase in tariffs after the US election in the second half of the year led to higher export costs, and the intensified competition in the printing industry triggered price drops that severely squeezed profit margins, the Group wrapped up the year with a loss.</p><p>During the reporting period, there were multiple structural challenges in the global business environment, with escalating geopolitical conflicts, deepening US-China rivalry, and further exacerbated trade barriers. Major economies pursued the \"near-shoring\" and \"friend-shoring\" policies which have accelerated the process of global supply chain restructuring, causing businesses to face additional cost pressures brought about by the industrial chain restructuring. The Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index hovered around the threshold, reflecting the continuing pressure on purchasing power in the end markets. Moreover, in view of the excess capacity in the industry, competitors have launched price wars to maintain their market share, resulting in a year-on-year decline in the Croup's overall gross profit margin despite a growth in business volume. Coupled with the new round of tariff policy implemented after the US election, the cost of the Croup's export business to the US has directly increased, which has become a key factor dragging down the profit margins. In the face of severe market conditions, the three plants in China and the ASEAN market were impacted to varying degrees during the period. The Guangzhou plant turned from profit to loss due to cost increases, while the Shaoguan plant remained profitable. The Suzhou plant recorded a loss due to the intensified price war in Eastern China. Likewise, the ASEAN market failed to maintain its profitable performance of last year as a result of the sluggish regional demand.</p><p>Facing the complex changes in the domestic and international environment, the Group adhered to the concept of seeking progress while maintaining stability. It continued to optimise resource allocation, deepen innovation-driven and green transformation, focus on cultivating new quality productive forces, strengthen investment in research and development and smart manufacturing, and promote upgrades in automation, information technology and intelligence. At the same time, it proactively developed emerging businesses, optimised its global customer service system, enhanced its ability to offer customised solutions, increased the proportion of high-value-added businesses, and continued to invest in green technology for building \"zero-carbon\" competitiveness. The Group endeavored to seize opportunities amidst industry changes, creating longterm value for shareholders and contributing to sustainable growth for the community. Details are set out in the section headed \"Business Review and Prospects\".</p><p>DIVIDENDS</p><p>In order to retain resources for the Group's future development, the Directors do not recommend a final dividend for the year ended 31st March, 2025 (2024: HK1.5 cents). An interim dividend of HKl cent (30th September 2023: HK1 cent) was paid for the six months ended 30th September, 2024.</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Hong Kong/Mainland China Operations Overview</p><p>During the period under review, the global economy showed a complex pattern of divergence. Although the major economies have started their rate-cutting cycles since the second half of last year to ease the pressure on finance costs, the structural challenges have not yet disappeared. Furthermore, with the downturn in the manufacturing industry, the accelerated regionalised restructuring of the global supply chain, and the renewed tightening of trade policy on China after the US election, enterprises were facing the double pressure of soaring costs and falling market demand. In addition, the announcement by the US earlier this year of multiple waves of tariffs on major trading partners and critical sectors, as well as the frequent changes in the relevant tariff policies, have caused markets to react negatively to the economic outlook and increased uncertainty in global trade, further exacerbating trade tensions and negatively affecting global economic and trade activities, and it is expected that a combination of these measures and counter-measures will result in a significant slowdown of global growth in the near term. Despite the increasing market competition and accelerated industry consolidation, the Group maintained a stable share in its core market by strategically adjusting the synergies of its production bases based on the strengths of its global footprint and intelligent industrial chain, but profitability was under pressure as a result of rising tariff costs and market competition.</p><p>Meanwhile, in order to strengthen its operational efficiency and risk control mechanism, the Croup has accelerated the transformation of smart production and introduced a new generation of industrial internet technology. By continuously allocating more resources to research and development, improving the independent innovation system and deepening collaboration between industry, academia and research institutes, the Group has continuously upgraded the technological content of its products and consolidated its competitive edge in the market. During the reporting period, the Group obtained a total of 142 patents, including 21 invention patents, 101 utility model patents, and 20 design patents. Further, the Group grasped the development trend of artificial intelligence by deeply integrating the application of Al technology in creative design, administrative operations and manufacturing processes, which has significantly enhanced its overall operational efficiency and created a differentiated competitive edge for the enterprise in a difficult environment.</p><p>Amid profound changes in the global economic landscape and increasing market volatility, the Group has always maintained its strategic certainty by establishing a dynamic monitoring mechanism to track changes in the international economic and trade situation in real time, and adopting a flexible and diversified capital allocation strategy to seize development opportunities in a complex environment. We have accelerated the development of our blueprint for sustainable development, deeply integrated ESC concepts into all aspects of our business operations, and continued to focus our efforts on key areas such as climate resilience enhancement, research and development of green materials, optimisation of talent cultivation system, circular economy, and energy restructuring, so as to steadily move tow/ards the goal of carbon neutrality. At the same time, the marketing team continued to expand its global business network by participating in international professional exhibitions and deepening partnerships with strategic customers in Europe, the United States, the ASEAN and the Greater China. With the outstanding performance in brand building, the Croup was conferred the \"Golden Jubilee Hong Kong Power Brand Award\" by the Hong Kong Institute of Marketing this year. During the period, the first \"Hong Kong International AIGC Cultural Digital Content Creation Competition\" hosted by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Starlite Group and Huanyue Education Group was officially launched at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, providing an in-depth experience of the fusion of the real industry and digital technology.</p><p>Southern China Operation</p><p>For the year ended 31st March, 2025, the Southern China operation of the Group recorded a loss amid sales growth. Despite the gradual normalisation of the global book supply chain and the easing of upward pressure on shipping costs triggered by the Red Sea crisis, the geopolitical tensions have led to a generally conservative inventory strategy by international publishers, which has posed a profitability challenge for the Southern China operation despite the increase in revenue. Looking ahead to the new financial year, in view of the conflicting industrial policies in the context of US-China rivalry, the continuation of the US tariff policy on China and the expected slowdown in global economic growth, the demand for traditional printed materials, children's books and greeting cards is expected to remain sluggish, which will exert significant pressure on the expansion of the Southern China operation and the profit margins.</p><p>In this challenging business environment, the Croup has continued to promote its digital transformation strategy, realising refined management of the entire value chain through a comprehensive upgrade of its intelligent production system. At the Shaoguan and Guangzhou production bases, the management team is advancing the transformation of the Internet of Things of production equipment, incorporating the entire process of order management, intelligent scheduling, material procurement, production scheduling and distribution of finished products into the digital platform, which has significantly enhanced the operational transparency and management efficiency. In addition, through the continuous improvement of the lean management system, the Southern China region has achieved significant improvements in key indicators such as production efficiency, cost control and per capita output, providing a solid guarantee for the Southern China operation to maintain its competitiveness under the tough market environment. These systematic optimisations have not only strengthened short-term risk resistance, but also laid a digital foundation for long-term high-quality development. During the period, the Shaoguan plant introduced automation innovation projects, including a fully automated cardboard laminating machine, a fully automated die-cutting machine, an intelligent cover forming machine, a high-precision diagonal arm plane screen printing machine, a folding cover sealing machine, and a multi-angle double-sided adhesive machine, and the Southern China region obtained a total of 13 utility patents throughout the year, such as an automatic envelope sealing machine, a fully automated high-speed waste cleaning machine, a folding box edging machine, and a glue spraying machine. On the other hand, the printing culture and education base located at the Shaoguan plant, which has been open for over one year, has been awarded titles such as the \"Shaoguan City Science Popularisation Education Base\", \"Wujiang District New Era Civilisation Practise Base\", \"Wujiang District Patriotic Education Base\" and \"Shaoguan Research and Practice Education Base for Primary and Secondary School Students\" by the local government authorities, affirming the cultural mission of giving back to society of Mr. Lam Kwong Yu as the Group's Chairman. During the period, over 80 children from Shaoguan Zhenjiang Jianguo Kindergarten and their parents gathered at the Starlite Base of Printing Culture and Education to participate in the parent-child practical activity titled \"Danxia Imprints: Exploring the Art of Printing\". Through a childlike lens, they embarked on a journey to uncover the millennia-old wisdom of printing.</p><p>The Group's eco-friendly brand, TEAM GREEN(Registered), made innovative breakthroughs during the reporting period and continued to expand its market influence through diversified marketing strategies. The brand not only successfully launched a series of Pokemon and Bluey co-branded licensed products, aiming to attract more young consumers and enhance brand influence; but it also cooperated with Beijing Central Axis to launch innovative wooden puzzle products, combining culture and education to enhance user interaction. By making use of its own brand, Robbi Family, it launched a series of products together with the Aerospace Cultural Industry Institute, including three-dimensional aerospace books, 10-in-1 board games and magnets, as well as three-dimensional postcards and other cultural and creative products. The brand also demonstrated the latest green design concepts by participating in professional exhibitions such as the Hong Kong International Book Fair, the Shanghai Children's Book Fair and the Hong Kong Pet Show; set up flash shops in Hong Kong at The LOHAS in Tseung Kwan O and Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill, and its own shop at Langham Place in Mongkok, to create immersive consumer experience. Also, it organised an exhibition on the theme of STEAM education in cooperation with Esiite, which covered various key business districts in Hong Kong; successfully established a presence in Cathay Pacific VIP Experience Shop to expand its high-end customer base; and collaborated with The Chinese University of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong Institute of Education to develop educational aids for gifted children, thereby strengthening its brand exposure and market share. On digital marketing, TEAM GREEN(Registered) has achieved considerable growth through emerging platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, the number of \"fans\" of its flagship shop was rising, and a number of popular products were launched successfully. The brand has also converted its commercial success into social value by not only creating a dedicated children's interactive space at the \"LoveXpress\" charity centre, but also donating to the companion programme of Yong Zen Foundation to help the balanced development of pre-school education through practical actions. During the period, TEAM GREEN(Registered) was awarded the Annual Membership Certificate by the China Toy &amp; Juvenile Products Association. Looking ahead, TEAM GREEN(Registered) will accelerate its expansion into the Southeast Asian market, deepen the integration of online and offline development, and continue to promote the commercialisation of environmental protection concepts.</p><p>Eastern China Operation</p><p>During the reporting period, the recovery of domestic demand was slower than expected in the process of China's economic restructuring and upgrading, coupled with the impact of the adjustment of the US tariff policy on China, major greeting card customers delayed the execution of their orders, causing a slight decline in revenue from the Eastern China operation. In the face of this challenge, the management team has proactively adjusted its business strategy to focus on the high-end pharmaceutical packaging segment, board games and collectible cards markets, and to enhance its ability to respond quickly to small-volume, multi-product orders. Despite the short-term adjustment pressure on its traditional business, the Eastern China operation has gradually built up a more risk-resistant and diversified development pattern through product restructuring and upgrading.</p><p>On the other hand, in the field of technological innovation and smart manufacturing, the Group has continued to increase its investment in research and development and deepen the mechanism of collaborative innovation between industry, academia and research institutes. The Suzhou plant has established a strategic partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to jointly carry out a number of key technology projects, including the joint research and development of a sponge adhesive machine for greeting card products and a wrapping paper machine, as well as the establishment of the Group's first \"dark factory\" demonstration project at Suzhou Rose Garden, which integrates industrial robots, an automated guided vehicle logistic system and a manufacturing execution management system to achieve 24-hour manpower-less intelligent production. Through continuous technological innovation, the Suzhou plant has established a complete innovation system covering material research and development, process improvement and equipment upgrading, providing customers with more competitive customised solutions and setting a new benchmark for the digital transformation of the industry. A total of 10 utility and invention patents were obtained in the Eastern China region throughout the year, including multi-axis robotic arm ballpoint machines, rotary packaging boxes, double-layer track conveyors, semi-automatic labelling machines, and packaging box equipment with high-stability gear linkage box opening structure. During the period, the Suzhou plant was awarded as the Suzhou Excellent Labour Harmony Enterprise, and the chairman of Taicang City Federation of Trade Unions also visited Suzhou Company to inspect and guide the construction of \"Employees' Home\".</p><p>South East Asia Operation</p><p>Although the South East Asia operation faced a number of temporary challenges during the year, including a decline in revenue due to the postponement of customers' projects and the pressure of rising paper costs, which resulted in a slight loss for the year, the Group has demonstrated a stronger resilience to risks through proactive strategic adjustment and operational optimisation. With the accelerated restructuring of the global industrial chain in recent years, the Group has seized the opportunity to continue to deepen its production capacity in South East Asia in order to flexibly cope with geopolitical fluctuations and market uncertainties. Through close collaboration with leading international brand customers, the operation team has been able to quickly align with their supply chain diversification strategies and business plans, and simultaneously increase resources investment in high-growth areas such as food packaging, consumer electronics and pharmaceuticals, laying the foundation for a medium to longterm recovery.</p><p>At the operational level, the South East Asia team continued to promote lean management upgrades to significantly enhance operational efficiency through process re-engineering, technological innovation and production loss control. Various lean improvement projects were completed during the year, which were not only optimised on-site management standards, but also led to a year-on-year reduction in unit costs, partially offsetting the adverse impact of raw material prices. Looking ahead, with the continued tightening of tariff policies in the US, a growing number of international customers are re-evaluating their supply chain deployment, and South East Asia has become an important destination for global manufacturing relocation due to its cost advantages and trade convenience. The Group has deployed its production capacity in advance and commenced in-depth discussions with a number of core customers on the transfer of orders, and is expected to see significant business growth opportunities in the new financial year. In addition, we are further strengthening our localised service capabilities and shortening lead times to better meet our customers' demand for an agile supply chain. Management is confident about the medium- to long-term prospects of the South East Asia operation and believes that the region will soon return to profitability and provide new growth momentum for the Group's overall results, driven by both the recovery in market demand and improved operational efficiency.</p><p>LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES</p><p>The Group's sources of funding include cash generated from the Group's operations and banking facilities provided to the Group by banks mainly in Hong Kong and Mainland China. As at 31st March, 2025, the Group's cash and bank balances and shortterm bank deposits amounted to approximately HK$199 million.</p><p>During the year under review, the interest expense of the Group amounted to approximately HK$2 million compared to approximately HK$4.4 million recorded last year.</p><p>As at 31st March, 2025, the Group had a working capital surplus of approximately HK$213 million compared to a working capital surplus of approximately HK$235 million as at 31st March, 2024. The Group was in net cash position as at 31st March, 2025 and 2024, based on short-term and long-term bank borrowings, lease liabilities and bills payables net of bank balance and cash of approximately HK$120 million (net cash) (2024: HK$149 million (net cash)) and shareholders' equity of approximately HK$580 million (2024: HK$625 million). The Croup's gearing ratio as at 31st March, 2025 was 13.6% (2024: 11%), based on short-term and long-term bank borrowings, lease liabilities and bills payables of approximately HK$79 million (2024: HK$69 million) and shareholders' equity of approximately HK$580 million (2024: HK$625 million).</p><p>CHARGE ON ASSETS</p><p>As at 31st March, 2025, certain assets of the Croup with an aggregate book carrying value of approximately HK$48 million (31st March, 2024: HK$8 million) were pledged to secure the banking facilities of the Group.</p><p>EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE</p><p>All the Group's assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, Chinese Renminbi, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollars or Euro. The exchange rate of US dollars/Hong Kong dollars is relatively stable due to the current peg system in Hong Kong. The Renminbi-denominated sales revenue helps to set off the Group's commitments of Renminbi-denominated operating expenses in Mainland China, accordingly reducing Renminbi exchange rate exposure.</p><p>HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT</p><p>Currently the Group has approximately 2,500 employees. The Group maintains good relationships with its employees, providing them with competitive packages, incentive schemes as well as various training programmes. The Croup has maintained a Share Option Scheme under which share options can be granted to certain employees (including executive directors and non-executive directors of the Company (excluding independent non-executive directors)) as incentive for their contribution to the Group. The Croup provides various training and development programmes to staff on an ongoing basis. The Croup will explore the possibility of launching other special training programmes with universities in Mainland China and education institutions abroad to enhance its staff quality.</p><p>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</p><p>As a responsible corporation, the Croup is committed to promoting social enhancement whilst developing its businesses, through active participation in social welfare and environmental protection activities to realize its mission. Regardless of where the Group operates, the Group treats the local communities as family members and strives to contribute to such communities.</p><p>In the past years, the Group has allocated significant resources to energy conservation and environmental protection, provided venues and platforms of training and job opportunities for young people, and actively supported help-poor and schooling campaigns as well as disaster relief efforts in China. Apart from providing financial support, the Croup also contributes people and time to various charity drives. In many circumstances, the Group's Chairman makes initiative to organize joint efforts with other enterprises and friends to pool resources together for the maximum benefits of those in need.</p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESC\") REPORT</p><p>The Group has established an environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") management team to manage, monitor, recommend and report on environmental and social aspects. An ESC report is being prepared with reference to Appendix C2 Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the \"Stock Exchange\") and will be published on the Company's website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.hkstarlite.com\">http://www.hkstarlite.com</url>) at the same time as the publication of the 2025 annual report.</p><p>LOOKING AHEAD</p><p>In the latest World Economic Outlook report released in April 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that the swift escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of policy uncertainty would have a significant impact on global economic activity. Growth projection is expected to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026, much below the historical average of 3.7% in the past 20 years.</p><p>Amid continuing economic uncertainties, the Group's management will adhere to the principle of prudent management, dynamically optimise its global resource allocation strategy, continue to enhance operational agility and ensure stable cash flow, while leveraging on the benefits of trade frameworks such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to consolidate business synergies in the Asia-Pacific region. It is believed that through these strategic initiatives and the deepening of lean culture, the Croup will be able to maintain business resilience amidst adversity and create sustainable returns for the stakeholders across the cycle.</p><p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</p><p>On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our shareholders, customers, bankers, suppliers and friends in the community for their continued support and all our staff for their loyalty and dedication.</p><p>Our market is inevitably linked to the US, and if it is headed toward an \"uncomfortable summer\" - the emergence of three major risks (employment, consumption and finance) amid uncertainty over Trump's tariff policy - we are likely to be affected. Currently, we are striving to steer clear of difficulties. We are expanding production in Malaysia, increasing production scale and facilities, recruiting more people, automating our processes, and enhancing performance-based incentives. We are fully implementing a \"partnership\" program, encouraging everyone to take responsibility as the owner and ensuring that every capital investment is focused on returns.</p><p>The shift away from \"China-centric\" production is irreversible and we are all prepared for it. Although no tariff is imposed on children's books currently, production in Malaysia is attracting other importers, and I plan for most production processes to be in Malaysia within four years, especially for board games. Therefore, it is imperative that the technology of our plants in Malaysia and Suzhou should complement each other, and both plants will focus on their respective development efforts.</p><p>We will be back on track within a year, and profit growth is foreseeable. We are attracting creative talent, and in addition to profits from production activities, trading also plays a part.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 4, Source: HongKong Stock Exchange, 205 words </p><p>July 11: STARLITE: CLOSURE OF REGISTER OF MEMBERS AND RECORD DATE</p><p>The board of directors (the \"Board\") of Starlite Holdings Limited (the \"Company\") announces that the annual general meeting (the \"AGM\") of the Company will be held on Wednesday, 27th August, 2025 at Emerald, Level 8, The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, International Commerce Centre, 1 Austin Road West, Kowloon, Hong Kong.</p><p>For determining the eligibility to attend and vote at the AGM, the Register of Members of the Company will be closed from Friday, 22nd August, 2025 to Wednesday, 27th August, 2025 (both dates inclusive), during which periods no transfer of shares will be registered.

This came during the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) annual development conference held in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, as experts, policymakers, and representatives of UN agencies and development partners discussed Ethiopia's efforts in building climate resilience and sustainable development. </p><p>Addressing the gathering, UNDP Resident Representative in Ethiopia Samuel Doe said Ethiopia, though a negligible contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, has emerged as \"an unmatched leader\" in the global response to the existential threat posed by climate change and a strong advocate for Africa's green journey. \"As we stand in critical danger in history, we are acutely aware of the unprecedented global challenges posed by climate change. These challenges demand urgent action, driven by global solidarity, and a shared vision for a sustainable future for all,\" he said. Noting that Ethiopia is currently leading the way in the green energy transition with its vast green energy sources, he said this potential not only paves the way for job creation but also accelerates Ethiopia's goal of achieving universal access to green and affordable energy by 2030. Doe, however, said that despite Ethiopia's notable strides, the country remains one of the most impacted by climate change. Between 2020 and 2023, 11 million Ethiopian people faced food insecurity and more than four million were internally displaced due to recurring droughts, floods, and conflicts, underscoring the urgent need for increased support and solidarity from the global community. While commending Ethiopia's achievements on the global green journey, conference participants also highlighted the severe impacts of climate change on the country and called for increased support for its efforts, particularly in accessing climate finance and private sector investments. Citing a recent World Bank report, Ethiopia's State Minister of Planning and Development Bereket Fesehatsion said the annual gross domestic product losses due to climate change in Ethiopia are expected to range between 1 and 1.5 percent, potentially rising to 5 percent by 2040, threatening the livelihoods of millions and undermining the country's development prospects. He said the Ethiopian government is implementing long-standing and consistent efforts to build a climate-resilient and green economy. The country has integrated climate resilience and green economic growth into its 10-year development plan (2021-2030), ensuring that climate considerations are at the core of its development agenda. Fesehatsion said Ethiopia is one of the few African countries to have developed a long-term low-emission and climate-resilient development strategy, aiming for a net-zero carbon emission and climate-resilient economy by 2050. During the meeting, the UNDP also announced its commitment to helping Ethiopia mobilize 2 billion U.S. dollars in green financing by 2030, mainly through assisting the country in exploring green bonds, carbon credits, debt swaps, and payment for ecosystem services.

Virtually all LAC countries have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero carbon by midcentury. Yet turning climate pledges into reality requires massive investment and technological support \u2014 areas where these nations face shortfalls. Decades of dependence on commodity exports and fossil fuels have left many LAC economies struggling to finance a green transformation. Upgrading energy infrastructure, building renewable power capacity, electrifying transport, and conserving critical ecosystems all demand capital and state-of-the-art technology on an unprecedented scale.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 33 countries of LAC form an integral part of the \"Global South\" \u2014 a grouping in which China also positions itself \u2014 and share many development aspirations. Regional leaders are pursuing green reindustrialization, renewable energy expansion and climate resilience as pathways to address economic inequality and environmental vulnerability. This is where China's role becomes pivotal, stepping in with the funding and know-how to bridge the gap between vision and implementation.</p><p>Over the last few years, a clear shift has occurred in the nature of Chinese investment. Chinese capital in 2022 and 2023 rebounded and pivoted toward renewable energy projects and clean-technology industries. Many of these new investments are led not by giant State-owned enterprises alone, but by China's private sector champions in clean tech. Companies like BYD and Great Wall Motors are making inroads in Latin America, expanding the green footprint beyond traditional big infrastructure deals.</p><p>Concrete examples of this green push abound. In Argentina's sunny Jujuy province, financing from the China Development Bank helped build Latin America's largest solar power plant, a sprawling 300-megawatt array that now lights up hundreds of thousands of homes. In Chile, Chinese support has funded the Punta Sierra wind farm in Coquimbo, harnessing the Pacific breeze to feed clean power into the grid. In northeast Brazil, a massive 180 MW wind farm in Bahia \u2014 built by Chinese company CGN Brazil Energy \u2014 began operation in 2023, generating an estimated 720 million kilowatt-hours annually and creating over 1,000 local jobs in the process. These projects are more than sporadic investments; they represent a growing mosaic of Chinese-backed renewable-energy infrastructure.</p><p>Beyond power generation, China is also wiring Latin America for the green transition. State Grid Corp of China, one of the world's largest utilities, has invested heavily in Brazilian power transmission lines to connect remote hydro dams and wind farms with urban centers. This helps resolve a critical bottleneck: Many Latin nations have ample renewable resources but lack the grid infrastructure to deliver that energy where it's needed. Chinese companies are stepping in to build that connective tissue. In public transportation, Chinese electric buses now glide through the streets of cities like Santiago and Bogota, providing cleaner options for commuters as local authorities seek to slash pollution. Each electric bus or solar panel that arrives deepens China's imprint on Latin America's sustainability landscape.</p><p>Complementary strengths and mutual benefits</p><p>The accelerating green partnership between China and Latin America is underpinned by fundamentally complementary needs. Latin America requires large-scale funding, infrastructure upgrades and affordable technology to fuel its green transition. China has exactly those resources in abundance \u2014 along with a strategic interest in exporting its green development model. In other words, Latin America's demand and China's supply are a natural match.</p><p>Consider renewable-energy technology. Over years of development, China has become a world leader in solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage. Chinese manufacturers drove down the cost of solar modules by more than 80 percent in the past decade, making solar power far more accessible globally. Latin America, blessed with intense sunlight and strong winds, stands to gain enormously from these cheaper technologies. By importing Chinese solar panels or partnering with Chinese firms to build wind farms, countries like Chile, Mexico and Brazil are rapidly expanding their clean energy capacity. Chinese expertise \u2014 from ultrahigh-voltage grid design to electric bus manufacturing \u2014 is helping Latin American cities and utilities leapfrog toward modern, low-carbon systems. This tech transfer is often bundled with financing from China's development banks or commercial lenders, creating a one-stop solution for Latin American governments looking to implement green projects quickly.</p><p>In fact, the collaboration between China and Latin America on green development stands as a hopeful model \u2014 one in which shared challenges beget shared solutions, and on which the road to a sustainable future is traveled faster because we travel it together</p><p>Crucially, the benefits flow both ways. Latin America gains infrastructure and progress toward climate goals, while China earns goodwill, market access, and a role in shaping the future of the global green economy. Investments in Latin American sustainability also help China address its own priorities. For example, by funding renewable energy abroad, China can create overseas demand for its green industries (which supports jobs back home) and secure long-term contracts for commodities needed in clean tech (like lithium for batteries). The \"shared vision of sustainable development\" and \"mutual benefits\" at the heart of China-LAC green cooperation is not just rhetoric \u2014 Latin America gets green growth, and China gets strategic partnerships and business opportunities.</p><p>There is also a strong social and human dimension to these projects. Latin American leaders are keen that the green transition also be a just transition \u2014 one that creates jobs, reduces inequality, and respects local communities. Here, too, China's role can be positive. Many Chinese renewable projects have brought employment and training to local residents, as seen with the Bahia wind farm's 1,000 jobs in Brazil. And by contributing to cleaner air and water, these collaborations directly improve quality of life. To maximize mutual gains, Latin American governments are encouraging Chinese investors to form joint ventures, use local suppliers, and transfer skills. When managed well, China's green investments can thus become a catalyst for Latin America's broader sustainable development, aligned with the region's goals of inclusive growth.</p><p>Challenges to a greener partnership</p><p>Despite the promising alignment, China's burgeoning role in Latin America's green transition is not without challenges. One major hurdle is navigating the regulatory and political complexities across diverse Latin American nations. Each country has its own legal framework, approval process, and standards for environmental and social safeguards. Chinese companies have sometimes struggled to adapt to these local requirements. Projects can be delayed or derailed by permitting issues, community protests, or shifts in government.</p><p>There is also the challenge of aligning priorities. While both sides want sustainable development, Latin American governments often emphasize that it must directly benefit local populations. As noted, reducing inequality is a key concern; green projects are expected to create jobs and social value, not just generate electrons or extract minerals. Building trust through local partnerships, hiring and training local workers and engaging transparently with communities is essential. Encouragingly, the awareness of this need is growing. The report on China-LAC green cooperation stresses the importance of \"localization of green practices by Chinese firms\" \u2014 essentially urging companies to adapt to local contexts and share benefits broadly. Some Chinese investors are currently pursuing joint ventures with Latin companies or source components locally to meet the host country's expectations.</p><p>Another consideration is environmental and financial sustainability. Latin America has hard-learned lessons about the pitfalls of resource investment booms, and some fear a green boom could repeat past mistakes if not managed well. Care must be taken to ensure renewable energy projects truly deliver on emissions reductions and do not inadvertently harm sensitive ecosystems. For example, large hydro dams can flood forests or displace communities if not carefully planned. Moreover, the financing model matters \u2014 loans should be structured so that countries do not fall into unsustainable debt for the sake of green projects. Here China has an opportunity to innovate with instruments like green bonds or partnerships with multilateral banks to spread risk. So far, many Latin American leaders remain optimistic that these issues are manageable with open communication.</p><p>A sustainable future forged together</p><p>As the world races to curb carbon emissions and avert climate catastrophe, the green transformation of Latin America and the Caribbean has become a matter of global significance. In this endeavor, China's role has emerged as both impactful and indispensable. Through sizeable investments, technology transfer and a shared vision of progress, China is helping to unlock Latin America's tremendous sustainable development potential. From the windswept plateaus of Argentina to the tropical sun of the Caribbean, solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles financed by Chinese partnerships are accelerating the region's shift to a low-carbon economy. Crucially, this is happening in a way that aligns with Latin American aspirations \u2014 creating jobs, upgrading industries and fostering inclusive growth.</p><p>Looking ahead, the promise of the China-LAC green alliance is bright. Both sides are doubling down on climate action: China has committed to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, while Latin American nations are pushing forward with renewable-energy expansions and nature-based climate solutions. Their partnership can be a powerful engine driving these commitments from paper to practice.</p><p>Of course, realizing it will require continued effort, mutual understanding and adherence to high standards. China's experience at home \u2014 building the world's largest solar and wind fleets, rolling out millions of electric vehicles, and lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty \u2014 offers valuable lessons for Latin American countries charting their own paths to sustainable prosperity. By applying those lessons in a tailored way, Latin America can leapfrog toward a green economy faster than would be possible alone. Indeed, the true significance of China's role in Latin America's green transition lies not just in kilowatts or dollars invested, but in the precedent it sets for international cooperation. It shows that through partnership, a developing region can harness support from a fellow developing giant to transform itself in line with global climate goals. In fact, the collaboration between China and Latin America on green development stands as a hopeful model \u2014 one in which shared challenges beget shared solutions, and on which the road to a sustainable future is traveled faster because we travel it together.</p><p>The author is director of research at the Institute of Innovative and High-Quality Development (Hong Kong).</p><p>The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://campus-cdhk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/store_manager/photo_pre/13/44/87/d65a783d-8e73-4200-9689-096241b3314e/high_wm.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["Upgrading energy infrastructure, building renewable power capacity, electrifying transport, and conserving critical ecosystems all demand capital and state-of-the-art technology on an unprecedented scale.

Declared a state of disaster by Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in April, the drought has slashed the country's cereal production by 77 percent, leaving 60 percent of the population food insecure. In response, the Zimbabwean government has launched a 3.3-billion-U.S. dollar aid appeal. </p><p>At a recent food distribution event in the Chingwizi resettlement area in Mwenezi District, Masvingo Province, a visible sense of relief was evident as villagers received double rations from the WFP, funded through an insurance payout from the African Risk Capacity (ARC) Group in July. \"The food rations have come at a critical time because I have exhausted all my household food stocks. I am very grateful for the life-saving food, which will also ensure that my young children continue to attend school,\" said Tariro Chitetu, a villager from the resettlement area. Precautious Musingakuri echoed similar sentiments, noting that the rations of maize, legumes, and vegetable oil will prevent the community from resorting to negative coping strategies. \"The drought is taking a toll on us, especially on the vulnerable, such as women, the elderly, child-headed families, and school children. Many households here are now taking one meal per day due to food shortages. We pray that the government and its partners, such as the WFP, will continue to help us with food aid,\" Musingakuri said. Mwenezi District Development Coordinator Isaac Mutambara highlighted the dire food insecurity situation in the district, saying, \"Due to the district's proximity to South Africa, the young and the energetic are crossing into South Africa, leaving women, the old, and the young to fend for themselves. This is a disastrous situation that we are grappling with.\" In response, through the intervention of the government and donor agencies, efforts are underway to climate-proof vulnerable communities, including drilling boreholes and establishing nutrition gardens to improve water and food availability in the district. WFP Program Policy Officer Munaye Makonnen said the 6.1-million-dollar drought insurance payout is supporting more than 272,000 people in the hardest-hit districts of Buhera, Mwenezi, and Mangwe with food aid from August to September. In an interview with Xinhua, Makonnen emphasized the increasing need for innovative financing to address climate change, saying, \"Things are becoming more unpredictable, and this is becoming more difficult for small-holder farmers. So we are trying to introduce innovative risk management strategies so that people are able to cope with climate change, and drought insurance is just one of the tools that we are employing.\" She pointed out that the WFP welcomes more contributions from partners and countries to support their premiums for the ARC risk insurance. Lynn Chiripamberi, the WFP representative for Masvingo Province, urged African governments to embrace ARC risk insurance to build long-term resilience against climate shocks. \"It is now time for African governments to be thinking through how they support initiatives that prepare communities for climate risks and how they help them to leap over from just life-saving initiatives into longer-term, more resilience building that makes sure that within a bad year, communities not only have buffers but can also spring back without necessarily relying on donor funding for immediate assistance,\" she said. Elizabeth Sibanda, ARC's communications strategist, noted significant drought insurance payouts to African governments this year due to intensified climate change, with future payouts expected to rise. As a specialized agency of the African Union, the ARC collaborates with African governments to build their capacities to manage climate risks. The ARC's payouts mainly assist stakeholders to implement early responses to the drought, she explained. \"We are a donor-funded organization, and most of our projects are funded by governments from all over the world, and we therefore welcome any help from any member because we are battling sustainability issues and to make our operations sustainable. We need as many people and organizations on board as possible, including the Chinese,\" she said. Zimbabwean Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube praised ARC's rapid-response solution for disaster risk management, noting that the payout will strengthen the country's efforts to mitigate drought impacts and solidify its resilience against climate-induced adversities.

More than 80 per cent of Pakistan's irrigated agriculture draws water from it. India's farmers and hydropower projects rely on it too. Playing politics with water is a reckless gamble with millions of lives. Brokered by the World Bank, the treaty gives the eastern rivers to India and the western ones to Pakistan. That balance has kept the peace - at least on the rivers. </p><p>In reality, India cannot suddenly block Pakistan's access to the rivers. India currently lacks the infrastructure to do so. But symbolism matters. By suspending treaty obligations, India damages its image as a responsible rising power. Pakistan's bluster - that it will respond with \"full force\" - is even worse. It treats the flow of water not as a shared necessity but as a trigger for war. The region cannot afford such dangerous bravado. </p><p>As politicians grandstand, the Himalayan glaciers are melting. Water is becoming more scarce, exacerbating droughts as floods become deadlier. The Indus Waters Treaty must be updated, not suspended, to cope with these realities.

Global warming has triggered frequent and intensified extreme weather events, which emphasizes the importance of early warning systems in disaster prevention and mitigation.In March 2022, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched the Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative.From global consensus to national action, China is implementing its National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035 to build a climate-resilient society.\"Ensuring universal access to meteorological early warning systems is not only a shared vision of the international community but also an important mission of China's meteorological departments. </p><p>China Meteorological Administration (CMA) will continuously enhance the meteorological science and technology, improve public services, deliver more robust scientific, institutional and governance support to achieve the goals of EW4ALL initiative, and contribute more wisdom and plans to building a community with a shared future for mankind,\" said Chen Zhenlin, head of the CMA.CMA has made great efforts to step up meteorological disaster monitoring, forecasting, and warning as well as prevention and response capabilities.Today, the new-generation National Emergency Early Warning Information Release System disseminates 82 types of warning information to designated emergency responders within one minute, achieving 99.1 percent public coverage.\"Enhancing meteorological science and technology capabilities underpins more timely, accurate and widespread early warning dissemination,\" said Chen Zhenlin.China has effective early warning mechanisms such as Progressive Service and High-Impact Alert and Response systems.

The 13th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Economic and Trade Ministers' Meeting was held in Seoul recently. Their foreign ministers also met in Tokyo on March 22 for the first time in four years. While no sweeping agreements emerged, this revival is profound and has significant regional and global stability implications. </p><p>As major global economies and Asia's three most extensive powers, these nations have acknowledged a crucial reality: It is time they take an active role in shaping their regional destiny rather than leaving it in the hands of external powers. The timing of this dialogue is no coincidence. The so-called \"Indo-Pacific\" has become a hotspot for Washington's competition strategy against China. The US' push to \"de-risk\" global supply chains and reduce dependence on China has brought allies like Japan and South Korea into a dilemma: lean further into US-led security or prioritize economic integration with China, their largest trading partner. Hence, the trilateral dialogue is a key factor in this complex dynamic. Meanwhile, long-standing tensions have heightened fears of conflict in a region already burdened by history and geographic disputes.China, Japan, and South Korea are signaling their own intent to set their course. They represent a hopeful step toward reclaiming regional agency. The three nations agreed to discuss accelerating negotiations on the trilateral free trade agreement that had been sidelined for years, demonstrating a shared interest in stabilizing supply chains amid the ongoing global uncertainty. They also pledged to deepen collaboration in digital and green economies and enhance local cooperation.These choices reflect a pragmatic approach to a region under immense pressure. Asian stability cannot be reduced to binary options - it requires a delicate balance in which regional cooperation plays a central role. However, reclaiming the cooperation does not imply decoupling from the US. Japan and South Korea remain deeply tied to Washington for security guarantees. Yet there is a growing perception that US strategies prioritize countering China over building proper stability in Asia. While America positions itself as the defender of the \"free world,\" it offers limited solutions to the region's pressing economic change. The stakes are global and regional for China, Japan, and South Korea. Their cooperation is critical in addressing transnational issues such as energy security and climate resilience. Sunday's meeting of economic and trade ministers articulated a vision for international cooperation rooted in regional necessity rather than external influence by emphasizing multilateralism. This matters far beyond Asia. In a world splintered by nationalism and ideological divides, localized solutions open pathways for rebuilding fragmented global governance. Still, trilateral cooperation is still influenced by the US' deeper involvement in the region, which is a significant geopolitical factor.Yet even modest beginnings can carry disproportionate significance. The meeting was about acknowledging a shared truth that Asia cannot rely on outside powers to shape its future. Whether managing US-China competition, climate change, or nuclear brinkmanship, solutions imposed from the outside will fail to address Asia's complexity, and regional stability will rely on practical and sustained cooperation among neighbors. The meeting of China, Japan, and South Korea reminds us that diplomacy in the 21st century often looks less like dramatic breakthroughs and more like incremental progress. As the Chinese proverb goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This step may light the way for a more self-determined Asia. </p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["While America positions itself as the defender of the \"free world,\" it offers limited solutions to the region's pressing economic change.
