Losses are likely to increase as climate change intensifies extreme weather events while rapid urban sprawl has increased asset values in high-risk areas. Protective measures such as dykes, dams and flood gates come at a price, but their financial benefits can exceed costs for rebuilding after a disaster by up to ten times, a Swiss Re Institute study shows.  Veronica Scotti, Chairperson Public Sector Solutions at Swiss Re said: \"Investments in climate adaptation, such as flood preparedness, not only promote economic stability and create jobs, but also help keep people safe. Yet there is chronic underfunding. It is therefore crucial to create the conditions for private capital to flow into climate adaptation projects and at the same time optimise the use of public funds. Quantifying the benefits of adaptation measures is a key step towards facilitating public-private investment and ultimately closing the huge financing gap.\"  To determine how effective investments in flood adaptation measures can be, it is important to quantify their financial benefits. Swiss Re Institute has carried out a study comparing economic benefits and cost ratios of selected flood adaptation measures. This value can serve as a guideline for investment decisions and help identify the best flood adaptation methods to ensure a community's economic stability, safety and resilience.  Benefit-to-cost ratio can vary significantly depending on the region. Swiss Re Institute research shows that grey infrastructure, such as dykes and levees, is highly effective in reducing coastal flood damage. Globally, their benefits can outweigh costs by two to seven times, and even up to ten times in flood-prone areas. Built to optimal standards, these structures can reduce flood damage by 60-90%, especially in densely populated regions. In less populated areas, nature-based solutions such as barrier island restoration or foreshore vegetation can be equally effective.  Similarly, policy interventions, such as land use restrictions, can enhance the value of flood prevention, particularly in emerging economies. Flood defences and, zoning restrictions are found to be almost twice as effective and feasible than accommodative measures, such as dry proofing for both coastal and river floods.  All flood interventions, especially when upgraded and maintained, can benefit both insurers and policyholders. The public and private sectors can work together in facilitating and accelerating risk adaptation: by focusing on preventing and reducing future flood losses, the public sector can shift the remaining risks to the re/insurance industry and support economic stability after disasters. By being involved in the early stages of planning protection measures, the re/insurance industry can help mitigate risks and provide financial protection.  Download report \"Resilience or rebuild?

They exhibit a rich diversity of ecosystems, including high-elevation rangelands, wetlands and peatlands, which host an abundant wildlife. Some species are endemic, which means they can be found nowhere else on Earth.</p><p>The HKH's cryosphere - glaciers, permafrost and other frozen areas - helps to maintain ecosystems functional and support biodiversity. This, in turn, is crucial for the direct and indirect benefits people obtain from ecosystems, including nature-based trade, health aspects and tourism. Such benefits are called ecosystem services.</p><p>However, the cryosphere is changing significantly. The change induced by the climate crisis is directly putting at risk people in mountainous areas as well as farmers downstream who depend on these water resources for drinking and irrigation, as the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental organisation, points out in a report. The authors stress that these changes have severe impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. This affects communities as well since their lives are intertwined with nature.</p><p>HKH member countries have already made important efforts to safeguard biodiversity. More than 40 % of the HKH region are protected. However, 39 % of the global biodiversity hotspots are still outside protected areas. This makes it harder to safeguard them not only from climate change but also from anti-environment policies, land-use change, pollution, introduction of invasive species and expanding markets.</p><p>Such dangers are a major threat to biodiversity.

Countries agreed to support the transfer of emission reductions, incentivise the private sector and pursue non-market approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation. However, little was achieved at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, and things came to a standstill at COP28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is particularly frustrating for Africa, where hopes were high in the run-up to COP28. Two months before the conference, the countries of the continent had agreed on a common position in the Africa Climate Summit Declaration, which proposed a 'global tax system including a carbon tax on fossil fuels, maritime transport and aviation'. Africa accounts for four percent of emissions but remains among the regions most affected by the climate crisis.</p><p>The global markets for carbon credits and offsets have suffered some serious reputational damage in the recent past. Broadly speaking, emission credits are permits for emissions authorised by a governing body to participants (e.g. companies or countries) in a regulated trading system with a cap. Emission offsets are created, for example, when a company invests in environmentally friendly projects to avoid emissions. These offsets can be traded on voluntary markets. </p><p>Despite criticism, revenues from carbon taxes and trading schemes totalled $ 95 billion last year, according to the World Bank. The Bank's recently published report 'State and Trends of Carbon Pricing for 2023: International Carbon Markets' shows that financial flows in the carbon markets have increased.</p><p>Research conducted by private-sector entities Trove Research and International Emissions Trading Association indicates that $ 17 billion were invested in carbon markets between 2020 and 2022. As of 2023, the global market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth almost $ 403 billion, according to a study by InsightAce Analytic, another firm. Africa has its eye on this money flow. It can help to close the huge gaps in its climate finance.</p><p>'Studies show that with $ 20 per tonne of nature-based carbon credits, $ 82 billion could be generated annually. That's about one and a half times the money Africa receives in official development assistance,' said Claver Gatete, executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, on the sidelines of COP28. According to Gatete, the UN agency is currently in talks with member states to ensure that Africa's partici\u00adpation in carbon markets is based on 'high integrity credits' which make sure the continent is able to unlock benefit-sharing policies, deployment of sustainable decarbonisation pathways and investments in nature-based solutions.</p><p>'Next major export'</p><p>In 2021, Gabon became the first African country to receive payments totalling $ 17 million from the Central African Forest Initiative to reduce emissions by protecting the rainforest in its Congo Basin.</p><p>This triggered a continental race for sovereign carbon-offset programmes. At COP27, Kenyan President William Ruto declared that his country's 'next major export' would be carbon credits. He said this as he joined other African heads of state to unveil the African Carbon Markets Initiative, which aims to unlock $ 6 billion in annual revenues by 2030 while creating 30 million green jobs in Africa and generating 300 million carbon credits.</p><p>A few weeks after COP27, Ruto launched an ambitious tree planting initiative that aims to plant 15 billion trees and restore about 5.1 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in Kenya by 2032, with the aim of obtaining carbon credits.</p><p>In 2023, the Kenyan leader hosted the first Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi and also positioned it as a platform for developing the continent into a hotspot for carbon credits. The summit ended with pledges for carbon credits worth $ 650 million under the African Carbon Markets Initiative.</p><p>The pledge was led by Middle Eastern conglomerates, notably the UAE Carbon Alliance and UAE's Blue Carbon Company, which signed multi-million-dollar land deals with several African governments to secure and manage forests, wetlands, peatlands, swamps and grasslands, as well as coastal mangrove forests. The governments' promise is to conserve these areas and generate carbon credits. In return, the conglomerates will sell the carbon credits to companies and governments that want to compensate for emissions and thus fulfil their climate pledges.</p><p>There are currently two types of carbon markets:</p><p>In compliance markets, governments set up and regulate an emissions trading system defined by a geographical area with an emissions cap. This is the case with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Under such a system, companies and countries that have exhausted their emission quotas can buy unused emission allowances from other companies to continue emitting beyond their quotas. They can also purchase 'offset credits' from other countries outside the geographical scope of the scheme.</p><p>In voluntary carbon markets, there is little or no regulation. Companies set their own emission targets and buy carbon credits from willing sellers to cover or offset their carbon emissions.</p><p>In Africa, it is mainly the voluntary market that is well established, as countries are slow to create a legal framework that enables a thriving compliance market. However, the voluntary market on the continent is controversial and has been criticised for being opaque, discriminatory, unfair and ineffective in terms of development and climate policy. The environment minister of Congo-Brazzaville, Arlette Soudan-\u00adNonault, described it as an 'unregulated Wild West'.</p><p>Kenya currently dominates the voluntary carbon market in Africa with projects such as a mangrove restoration initiative and the Northern Rangelands Trust's carbon projects, according to Kenya's special climate-change envoy Ali Mohamed. Other countries with similar projects include C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p><p>Seven weeks after the 2023 summit in Nairobi, the Kenyan government began forcibly evicting the Ogiek community from their homes in the Mau forest complex, blaming them for the deforestation of more than 2500 hectares. The government plans to fence the forest and plant 4.3 million trees. However, the evictions were temporarily halted by the Environment and Land Court two weeks after they began.</p><p>Serious flaws</p><p>It is not only in Kenya that Africa's call for carbon credits, which are touted as nature-based solutions, is being criticised by climate policy think tanks, the scientific community and civil society. They slam various projects on the continent for lack of transparency, lack of equitable revenue sharing, greenwashing and dispossession of indigenous and local communities.</p><p>In 2023, the human-rights group Survival International published a report exposing serious flaws in the Northern Rangelands Grassland Carbon Project, one of Kenya's many initiatives, including lack of prior informed consent and financial probity, opaque benefit-sharing, lack of scientific rigour and governance concerns.</p><p>The Oakland Institute, an independent policy think tank based in the US, has warned in its 2023 report that Africa faces 'devastating social and environmental impacts', including 'the prevalence of corruption and fraud in voluntary carbon markets'.</p><p>According to Anuradha Mittal, Executive Director of the Oakland Institute, the fixation of Kenya and other countries on voluntary carbon markets ignores their failures. Mittal argues that these markets have not led to a reduction in carbon emissions. 'Conflicts of interest, fraud and speculation plague these markets, while the expansion of carbon offset programmes and tree plantations leads to the expropriation of community lands to make profits for investors,' she said. 'The expansion of carbon markets does not benefit Africa, but perpetuates the status quo of resource exploitation, greenhouse-gas pollution and power imbalance.'</p><p>A coalition of civil societies led by Power Shift Africa and Climate Action Network International also published a damning report stating: 'Carbon markets benefit polluters, fossil-fuel companies and market brokers. They drive pollution beyond climate limits and are neo-colonial barriers to realising genuine African development pathways.'</p><p>If Africa's participation in the carbon markets is to truly benefit the continent, its people and its nature, the situation must develop differently.

They renewed this promise in 2009 when they committed to jointly mobilise $ 100 billion per year by 2020 to this end. At the 2015 climate summit in Paris, they agreed to extend that goal until 2025 and to set a new collective goal of at least $ 100 billion per year for the period after that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a previous contribution, we assessed to what extent rich countries meet their obligations. We concluded that they largely fail to do so. In this essay, we check what changed after the most recent UN climate summit in December 2023 in Dubai (COP28).</p><p>At COP28, new pledges were made to different climate funds that help poorer countries to take action on climate. First, at the opening of COP28, a fund covering loss and damage was formally established. Following suit, several countries announced pledges to the fund. France and Italy made the largest commitment ($ 108.9 million each), followed by Germany and the United Arab Emirates ($ 100 million each). In total, pledges so far have reached about $ 661 million.</p><p>UNFCCC members had decided to establish the Loss and Damage Fund at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022. The aim was to compensate vulnerable countries for climate-induced harm which already occurred or no longer can be avoided, and which goes beyond what people can adapt to. </p><p>However, despite this decision, negotiations on how the fund would operate continued through 2023. Finally, stakeholders agreed that the fund will be administered by the World Bank, via a board of 26 directors representing both industrialised and developing countries. The fund should receive both public and private contributions.</p><p>Second, Dubai saw additional funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The GCF was created in 2010 to provide developing countries with funding for both mitigation and adaptation. The fund accepts contributions from UNFCCC countries, public, non-public and alternative sources, including countries not party to the UNFCCC and private foundations. A total of $ 9.3 billion were confirmed for the initial resource mobilisation from 2015 to 2018, while $ 9.9 billion were confirmed for the first replenishment period from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>The second GCF replenishment period is running from 2024 to 2027. Previous to COP28, countries had already pledged to deliver $ 9.3 billion during that period. In Dubai, an additional $ 3.5 billion were announced. If all contributions are confirmed, the GCF will receive at least $ 12.8 billion in the period.</p><p>Third, several countries made pledges to the three UNFCCC funds dedicated to adaptation. All funds were established in 2001. Concerning the Adaptation Fund, the countries pledged a total of $ 192 million. Germany promised the largest sum ($ 65.7 million). The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to providing financial resources for climate adaptation in countries which are not mentioned as advanced countries in \u00adUNFCCC Annex I - and especially the most climate-vulnerable ones.</p><p>The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) focus on adaptation in the areas of agriculture, water and nature-based solutions as well as early warning and climate information systems. In Dubai, pledges to the LDCF totalled $ 141.7 million, while those to the SCCF amounted to $ 32.5 million. Both funds are operated via the Global Environmental Facility. While the LDCF focuses on the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of least-developed countries, the SCCF supports all developing countries with a special focus on climate adaptation in small island states.</p><p>Keeping things in perspective</p><p>According to an OECD report, in 2021 the total climate finance provided amounted to $ 89.6 billion (OECD 2023). Based on preliminary data, OECD finds it likely that the $ 100 billion goal was met in 2022. Without a doubt, the pledges made in Dubai are an important step towards fulfilling the goal in the medium term.</p><p>However, the good news should be taken with a grain of salt for at least three reasons. First, $ 100 billion per year is only a small fraction of what is needed to fund adaptation and loss and damage in developing countries.</p><p>Second, the burden for the $ 100 billion/year goal continues to be unevenly distributed. The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., assessed how much each developed country should contribute to the goal based on their GNI and population. According to the WRI, only very few countries contribute their fair share, and the pledges made in Dubai did not change that.</p><p>Third, some of the most important reasons why developed countries fail to keep their promises have not been successfully addressed in Dubai. For example, not complying with climate-finance pledges remains unsanctionable.</p><p>Growing geopolitical challenges</p><p>Meanwhile, geopolitical conflicts keep diverting attention and resources away from climate financing. Western countries have increased their military budget since Russia's attack on Ukraine. This money cannot be spent on other objectives, including climate action. The Gaza war is a major source of instability too. Hostilities have escalated since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and there is a considerable risk of the war spreading across the Middle East. Animosities between the US and Iran are a sign of concern, as is the strategic competition between the US and China.</p><p>The outcome of the US presidential elections is likely to impact climate finance too. Under Donald Trump as president, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement in 2017. President Joe Biden returned his country to the agreement after entering office in 2021. Should Donald Trump win the election in November this year, American and international climate policy might suffer tremendously.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["7 million).

It was noted that there need be no tradeoff   between domestic mitigation and raising cross-border finance, even where host   countries retain emissions reductions from voluntary projects to count towards   their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). - High-integrity supply and demand . Speakers applauded progress made on the   important work initiated at COP26, to build supply and demand-side standards   to secure credibility, integrity, and transparency. Speakers noted the   importance of supporting and coalescing around the final standards, led by   ICVCM and their Core Carbon Principles and Assessment Framework on the supply   side, and VCMI and their provisional Claims Code of Practice on the demand   side. - Building high integrity demand. Lessons learned by corporates and financial   institutions seeking to finance high-integrity carbon projects were discussed.   Participants noted the need for the private sector to prioritize absolute   emissions reductions but with appropriately defined scope to recognize   compensation of residual emissions. Participants noted that these efforts sit   within a broader architecture of carbon accounting standards and net-zero   frameworks and recognized these need to come together in a consistent and   efficient way. - Capacity building and de-risking . The challenges associated with building and   scaling high-integrity carbon projects in EMDEs were recognized, as well as   the need for innovative financing mechanisms to de-risk these projects in   these regions. Attendees also emphasized the need to ensure that local   communities and indigenous peoples remain at the core of project design and   are able to reap maximum co-benefits.</p><p>Following the event, COP28 President-Designate, His Excellency Dr Sultan Al Jaber, said : \"Voluntary carbon markets have the potential to be a powerful enabler in financing decarbonization efforts across industries, cities and entire economies, especially in emerging and developing economies. In order to achieve their potential, we must enhance the credibility of carbon markets and ensure that the highest-integrity standards are firmly in place. This can only be done through collaboration between governments, organizations, and civil society to create a supportive regulatory environment, establish a level playing field, and raise universal standards. By working together, acting in unity and focusing on integrity, the value of this vital tool in our collective decarbonization efforts will increase.\"</p><p>UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance and GFANZ Co-Chair, Mark Carney, said : \"With only seven years left to halve emissions and keep 1.5 degrees alive, we cannot afford to leave major sources of climate finance untapped. Voluntary carbon markets could channel hundreds of billions of dollars to nature-based solutions and accelerated coal phaseout. Critical work this year to deliver supply and demand side standards for these markets can support a high ambition path to net zero, where companies prioritize decarbonization and compensate for residual emissions along the way.\"</p><p>For all media enquiries and requests for interviews, please contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@cop28.com\">media@cop28.com</email> For up-to-date COP28 news, follow us on Twitter @COP28_UAE</p><p>Notes to Editors:</p><p>COP28 UAE:</p><p>- COP28 UAE will take place at Expo City Dubai from November 30-December 12,   2023.

At the same time, food production contributes to climate change, causing about 30?% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. This multifaceted problem needs a multifaceted solution. The global community, and countries in their contexts, must modify food systems in ways that overcome current food insecurity and ensure food security long term. All issues must be addressed head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Food security' is defined as access to sufficient quantities of food in appropriate quality. It obviously depends on an adequate and affordable supply of all ingredients required for a nutritious diet. Today, about 735 million people around the world do not get sufficient food and are undernourished as a result. About 3 billion, moreover, do not consume healthy diets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unless comprehensive action is taken, the climate crisis will make matters worse. A holistic agri-food system perspective must consider the entire range of actors involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products. It must also take account of agriculture (including livestock), forestry, fisheries and food industries, as well as the broader economy, social disparities and the natural environment.</p><p>A sustainable food system must achieve good nutrition for all in a way that preserves the foundations of future generations' food security. This challenge has economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It is crucial to preventing further loss of biodiversity and to stabilising the climate.</p><p>Mitigation, adaptation, transformation</p><p>Many national food systems, as well as the global food system, are losing resilience. 'Resilience' is the capability to cope with shocks without significant loss of livelihood, health and nutrition. Food-system resilience can be understood as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. It is therefore essential to limit the climate-related hazards that affect food supply, reduce food systems' vulnerability and lower people's exposure to risks. Three policy approaches serve this triple purpose:</p><p>Mitigation of climate change. Radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is indispensable for sustainable food security. Global heating is leading to extreme weather events, which affect production as well as farm workers' health. Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests. And this is not just a terrestrial agenda, because climate change affects oceans, which also have a bearing on food systems. Nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, coupled with sustainable land and soil management, serve mitigation. However, mitigation in itself is no longer enough to safeguard food security.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change. People can protect themselves by increasing their chances to cope. Important issues include affordable access to clean energy, water and healthcare. All of them have a bearing on good nutrition. Long-term adaptation, however, will be impossible unless mitigation puts an end to further heating.</p><p>Transformation. Socio-ecological systems, including the lifestyles of wealthy nations, must change to become sustainable. In particular, people in high-income countries must reduce their consumption and assume responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p><p>The climate crisis negatively affects food security in several ways. For example, access to safe drinking water is becoming more precarious. Climate events like floods often disrupt it. Diarrhoeal diseases, however, affect humans' intake of micronutrients. These illnesses have a strong correlation with rising temperatures. At the same time, heat waves make it more difficult to handle food safely.</p><p>The climate crisis also affects market dynamics and causes price volatility. Price hikes are happening more frequently. Several issues can exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shortfalls in food production. They include poor market transparency, financial speculation in commodity markets as well as export restrictions. The current grain-market disruptions resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine show how important unrestricted exports are.</p><p>Crucial policy areas</p><p>Policymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones. Cross-cutting action is necessary. In particular, progress is needed in seven policy areas:</p><p>Sustainable land management (SLM): Relevant aspects include sustainable water management, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as the protection of biodiversity. SLM incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) are necessary. Crop cultivation and livestock production must be practiced in economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways. Social protection. Poverty often undermines families' food security. Nutrition interventions like school meal programmes are helpful. So are cash-transfer schemes or job creation. Countries with low and middle incomes deserve support for improving social protection. Access to healthcare and education are essential. Where related polices are not in place, they should be adopted. Food security hinges on the reduction of inequality. Diversification. Diversifying agriculture and supply chains strengthens food-system resilience. However, diversification has costs as it reduces opportunities for economies of scale and specialisation. Transaction costs tend to rise accordingly. Another challenge is that resilience is not just about withstanding current shocks, but also about maintaining the capacity for future development. If diversification hampers the latter, it is not fully conducive to resilience building.</p><p>International trade. Ensuring free and open global food trade will require a reinvigoration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Panic-induced border closures lead to international price spikes. Transparent information on production, stocks and government interventions around the world is critical and must be made publicly available (e.g., through the Agricultural Market Information System - AMIS). Trade facilitation in terms of investments in infrastructure - including particularly the digitisation of customs systems - matters too.</p><p>Insurance is a promising tool to strengthen food-system resilience. It spreads both the risks and the costs of negative shocks among a large pool of people, enhancing resilience at the level of individuals. However, it does not prevent or reduce climate risks. Insurance may thus prove counterproductive if it motivates people to continue unsustainable activities. Though this kind of financial service is quite effective in terms of managing individual shocks, it is less useful when many people experience shock impacts at once, as is typically the case in extreme weather events. Migration. In response to the climate crisis, people are leaving their homes. In some cases, migration is basically a form of livelihood diversification. Remittances from migrant workers contribute to their families' resilience after all. However, entire areas are likely to become uninhabitable, for example, as the rising sea level inundates islands. Migration processes and policies need to be coordinated, and both sending and receiving countries must act in ways that make migration strengthen the resilience of individuals and systems. Climate refugees from countries that are becoming uninhabitable must get an internationally recognised climate refugee passport.</p><p>Science-based innovation. Science is facilitating key innovations in food systems, including efforts to reduce risks and to enhance productivity. Bioscience and digital technology are important. Scientific research also helps to find new ways to maintain and, if necessary, renew productive soils, water resources and even entire landscapes. Science is also needed to protect biodiversity, including agricultural genetic diversity. Research can help to reduce inequality too. More funding is needed for research on food systems.</p><p>We live in the Anthropocene, the age in which humanity is shaping the Earth's geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. Action to enhance food security must be embedded in a broad strategic agenda of transformation. The global community must shift to a sustainable bioeconomy. It also needs a coherent governance structure to safeguard both food security and the global environment. The SDGs provide the concept, but not the policy framework for such joint action.</p><p>Long-term food security is intricately linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biodiversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sustainable Development Goals. So far, appropriate funding has not been made available for any of the above-mentioned global agreements. That must change for the sake of humanity's common future.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests.

Thirty years later, it is still in question whether and to what extent related promises are being fulfilled. Climate-related finance is a broad term. Generally speaking, it means funding (either public or private) for reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions or adapting to the impacts of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that governments only have indirect discretion over private finance flows, we will focus on public finance in this essay. Public climate finance follows different avenues:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It can be delivered through mechanisms established alongside the climate regime, such as the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), which then allocate funding to climate-related activities.</p><p>Money can also be allocated via other multilateral institutions, especially multilateral development banks, which then fund efforts in developing countries.</p><p>Finally, it can be delivered bilaterally, according to agreements between high-\u00adincome and developing countries.</p><p>Tackling global environmental challenges</p><p>Climate finance is thus directly related to climate-change mitigation, climate adaptation or both. However, it may also target broader objectives, for example, nature-based solutions for infrastructure purposes in line with the objectives of the three so-called Rio conventions. Apart from the \u00adUNFCCC, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification were on the agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Global environmental objectives include:</p><p>limiting global warming to less than 2?oC compared to pre-industrial levels,</p><p>halting further loss of biodiversity,</p><p>protecting land and marine ecosystems and</p><p>stopping land degradation.</p><p>Biodiversity finance aims specifically to stop or reverse nature loss in order to protect human health and prosperity. Progress on this front was recently made at the 2022 UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming-Montr\u00e9al. For example, the summit foresaw an annual $?20 billion of biodiversity funding from 2025, rising to $?30 billion from 2030.</p><p>The climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh in 2022, moreover, decided to establish another form of climate finance. Loss and damage funding is supposed to compensate vulnerable countries for harm already caused by climate change. However, UNFCCC members did not reach an agreement on how loss and damages will work in practice, so progress cannot be evaluated yet.</p><p>Three caveats should be made before looking at the progress high-income countries have made in providing public finance:</p><p>A political commitment is different from a legally binding goal.</p><p>Committed and disbursed funding are not synonyms.</p><p>Actual results depend on disbursed money being used for tangible purposes. Assessing whether that is the case is extremely important, but beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>$?100 billion a year</p><p>At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, developed countries pledged to jointly mobilise $?100 billion per year by 2020 to address climate change in developing countries. The decision was a rare example of a quantified climate-related finance target. The pledge was formalised one year later. The Paris climate summit decided that $?100 billion per year should be seen as a minimum, not a goal. The pledge included public, private, bilateral, multilateral and alternative funding.</p><p>So far, the pledge remains unfulfilled. Its reiteration along with the promise to live up to it soon have become an awkward ritual of the UN's annual climate summits. The gap seems to be closing, but progress has been painfully slow.</p><p>In 2022, the OECD published data on climate finance for the years 2013 to 2020. In that time span, disbursements increased by almost 60?%, from $?52 billion in 2013 to $?83?billion in 2020. Public finance (both bilateral and multilateral) played the largest role. Its share in total increased, from 73?% ($?38 billion) in 2013 to 82?% ($?68 billion) in 2020.</p><p>Assessments from WRI and ODI</p><p>The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., also analysed finance for the period from 2013 to 2018. Adjusting data to eliminate double counting, it presented smaller numbers than the OECD. According to the WRI, bilateral and multilateral climate finance from high-income to developing countries amounted to only $?22 billion in 2013 and $?33 billion in 2018. Including outflows from multilateral development banks, the figures rose to $?34 billion in 2013 and $?55 billion in 2018.</p><p>According to either data set, high-income countries did not collectively meet their pledges. Attempts to break down responsibility country by country show that very few are contributing enough. The failure fits a pattern. In 1970, high-income countries pledged to spend an annual 0.7?% of their gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA). Collectively, they only disburse about 0.33?% of their joint GNI.</p><p>The WRI's analysis assessed how much each developed country should contribute towards the $?100 billion/year goal considering their GNI and population, which are proxies for responsibility and capacity for climate action. The authors calculated countries' fair share based on two different scenarios. The first was that at least $?70 billion of the total should be public finance. The second was that public finance would cover $?100 billion, given that this amount is a floor, not a target. The WRI concluded that, in 2018, only Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden paid their fair share under the first scenario, and only France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden did so under the second.</p><p>Britain's Overseas Development Institute (ODI) similarly concluded that in 2017/2018, only Norway, Sweden and Germany provided their fair share, with France and Japan coming close. The USA was at the bottom, providing a mere four percent of its fair share.</p><p>Why countries fail to comply</p><p>There are several reasons why developed countries fail to fulfil their pledges. First of all, there is no sanction for non-compliance. Most climate commitments are toothless, even if they are considered legally binding. Removing the threat of sanctions makes negotiations easier, but the price is a lack of incentives for countries to comply.</p><p>The collective nature of the pledge is another factor. At first glance, a collective pledge is easier to make since individual partners do not commit to a specific sum. In the longer run, of course, it is difficult to hold individual countries accountable for collective failure if there never was a clear agreement on burden sharing.</p><p>In addition, there is still a lot of debate about how to implement the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) within the UNFCCC. According to this principle, high-income countries should provide climate-related finance to developing countries. Yet countries disagree about how they should be held accountable for past emissions, and how current emissions should be addressed. These arguments generate more heat than light. As a matter of fact, no country is a monolithic entity, so governments pay attention to a variety of interests. Moreover, country groups are very heterogeneous too.</p><p>Growing polarisation</p><p>Finally, the international system is changing, and those changes have impacts on climate negotiations. Strategic competition of the USA and China is increasingly polarising the multilateral scenario, with countries taking sides on political, economic and technological issues. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have further deepened the divide.</p><p>It also matters that the US has a long history of slowing down climate action. In 2001, President George Bush Jr. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that it created an unfair trade advantage for China. In 2017, President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Although President Joe Biden has reinstated climate change as a key issue, the current fragmentation in American politics makes it less likely that the US will assume its fair share of responsibility. Tensions between the two countries affect prospects for international cooperation in general. Like the rest of the world, both the USA and China have a rational interest in tackling climate change. Yet it remains to be seen if they will be able to collaborate in this area as competition on other issues increases.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Finally, it can be delivered bilaterally, according to agreements between high-\u00adincome and developing countries.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has repeatedly made urgent statements about what this means: more extreme weather events, scarce water, an uncertain food situation and probable social upheavals, to name but a few. But it also means fewer species and less biodiversity, and that we will conceivably reach ecosystem tipping points. More than 50 % of all natural ecosystems have already been destroyed; one in every eight species is at risk of extinction. Then we will lack important pollinators such as birds or insects, for example. The planet's limits have been reached. Only resolutely setting a new course can help.</p><p>The best way to do this is by jointly addressing climate and biodiversity. They reinforce each other, both positively and negatively. When forests are cleared for farming, not only are species and ecosystem services lost, but vast amounts of climate-damaging greenhouse gases are also released. According to joint analyses by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, plants and oceans absorb about half of the CO2 emitted by humans - and they do so naturally. This ability is reduced by global warming and changes in the oceans. It is therefore important to quickly cut emissions from fossil fuels while simultaneously preserving forests, oceans and natural habitats. Their outputs are important for drinking water, food and oxygen. But they also store carbon and slow down further warming.</p><p>Placing areas under protection is not enough to achieve these ends.

The full updated announcement is set out below. The above change has been reflected in the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24) which is available on the Shell website and has been marked with a footnote in the ETS24 itself. An updated version of the ETS24 has also been filed with the NSM. ---   * Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope     1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A].   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.

It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>) Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.

Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year [A]. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. [A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.  B. Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and     higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than     those of oil products.  C. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and     increasing sales of renewable power.  D. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen,     which are low- and zero-carbon products.  E. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source.  F. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\\xB0C above pre- industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024  B. MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in     managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities.

Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.

In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online :     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.   Population, GDP, demand and consumption of energy 2000-2040                                             2000-2040   Population                                x1.5   GDP                                       x3.4   Aviation (passenger km)                   x5.3   Passenger road (vehicle km)               x3.1   Marine (tonne km)                         x2.2   Heavy industry (tonne steel equivalent)   x2.6 Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023). Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.

Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.  B. Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and     higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than     those of oil products.  C. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and     increasing sales of renewable power.  D. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen,     which are low- and zero-carbon products.  E. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source.  F. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\\xB0C above pre- industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024  B. MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in     managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A     lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial     impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from     A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.

These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Forward-looking statements This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec- filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

Under the agreement, Climeworks will remove more than 7,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide\u00a0(CO2) from the atmosphere on Partners Group?s behalf, which will be permanently stored underground. The DAC agreement with Climeworks is a significant step for Partners Group, which announced in 2022 that it would develop a decarbonization program to achieve net zero corporate greenhouse gas (?GHG?) emissions by 2030. While a priority of the program will be to reduce the firm?s overall emissions, removing residual emissions via capture and storage of atmospheric CO2 will also play a role in achieving the net zero goal. The agreement with Climeworks is Partners Group?s first adoption of a technology-based solution to address GHG emissions and sits alongside the firm?s growing portfolio of nature-based solutions, such as reforestation, which also contribute to enhancing biodiversity.  Partners Group co-led a CHF 600 million fundraising round in Climeworks in 2022 on behalf of its clients. As it\u00a0does with all portfolio companies, the firm is currently working with the Climeworks management team and other investors with a focus on addressing the massive scale up the industry requires.  David Layton, Partner and Chief Executive Officer, Partners Group, comments: ?The agreement with Climeworks reflects Partners Group?s focus on sustainability and its commitment to achieving positive stakeholder impact over the long term. Our aim is to be a sustainability leader in private markets by driving forward positive change at the companies under our stewardship, and also by playing a leading corporate role in the transition to a net zero global economy.? Christoph Gebald, co-founder and co-CEO, Climeworks, says: ?We are proud to welcome our investor Partners Group as a client and to support their journey toward net zero. High-quality carbon removal must be scaled to gigaton level by 2050, and multi-year agreements like this one are a crucial lever. Partners Group?s commitment to high-quality carbon removals underlines the leading role of the financial services industry in this scale-up. As one of the global leaders in private markets, Partners Group sends a strong signal, which will hopefully inspire more companies to take action on carbon removal.? Climeworks? DAC technology actively removes CO2 from the atmosphere in a scalable manner, which can\u00a0then be permanently stored\u00a0underground. In Iceland, where Climeworks operates the world?s largest DAC facility and storage installation in operation, called Orca, its air-captured CO2 is mixed with water and pumped underground, where, through the Carbfix method, it reacts with basaltic rock formations and mineralizes. Through this accelerated natural process, the CO2 turns into stone and is permanently removed from the air for thousands of years. This full DAC and storage process is third-party verified by an independent quality and assurance leader. In 2022, Climeworks broke ground on a second, larger plant in the same country, called Mammoth, which represents a demonstratable step in the Company?s ambitious scale-up plan.

(OFP), a pioneering open forest measurement, reporting and verification platform built on a carbon neutral blockchain, today announced it has raised USD 4.1 million in a recently closed pre-seed round, attracting some 17 investors groups including venture capitalists and angel investors. VC tech specialists such as Shima Capital, \u00dcbermorgen Ventures, Not Boring Capital, Mercy Corps Ventures, Byzantine Marine, Big Brain Holdings and Valor Capital have joined with a number of angel investors in supporting the platform. Founded in 2021, OFP is already working with some  projects worldwide through its revolutionary blockchain-based measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) technology. These projects will be the first in history to utilize OFP?s 100% blockchain-native MRV platform. Open Forest Protocol is an open platform allowing forest projects of any size, all over the world, to measure, report and verify their forestation data ? thus creating benefits all along the value chain, from local communities on the ground to the voluntary carbon market. Funds raised are being used to continue to build and ship the core infrastructure of the system and to ramp up the onboarding of projects across governments, NGOs and individuals. Founded by Swiss scientist Frederic Fournier and American web3 specialist Michael Kelly, OFP brings together an international team of passionate and skilled professionals to combine expertise in environment, climate and blockchain. Prior to raising a pre-seed, OFP?s original funding came from a single angel contributor. OFP Project, Green Balam Forests, with the Forester data collection app in the field in Guatemala Carbon neutral blockchain technology OFP gives decentralized agency to forest projects of any size to measure, report and verify their forestation data on the Proof of Stake (PoS), climate neutral NEAR blockchain by registering their forest project within OFP?s open-access platform. Projects record tree data within the forest using OFP?s mobile app and then send the information to be immutably stored in the open, blockchain-based registry. In what has been an expensive, exclusive, opaque and slow system which unfortunately excludes the majority of potential projects and local communities, OFP?s innovative approach is a validator network whose sole responsibility is to ensure that only valid, verifiable data passes through. This network coalesces around the ground truth data provided to the platform, and stress-tests it against the unique capabilities, data sets and technologies that validators have access to. As a result, every single data set is ultimately reviewed by dozens of entities such as validation/verification bodies (VVBs) and forest expert companies in remote sensing, environmental consulting, etc. Fred Fournier, Open Forest Protocol CEO, said: ?The strong support of investors experienced in our pre-seed round is a validation of both our vision and strategy. Only an equitable, truthful system backed by immutable, open data will truly value forests on the ground as well as in the voluntary carbon market. We must act together to fight for our planet and give value to nature.? ABOUT OPEN FOREST PROTOCOL Open Forest Protocol is an open forest measurement, reporting and verification platform built on a carbon neutral blockchain. As a public protocol, OFP has its legal seat in Zug, Switzerland, a team of developers in Ukraine, on the ground specialists in East Africa and Central America, engineers and economists in the USA, legal and managing execs in Western and Northern Europe. # # # Media contacts: U.S. &amp; North America:Henry Feintuch / Liz SaveryT: +1-646-753-5710 / +<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:1-917-805-4581henry@feintuchpr.comliz@feintuchpr.com\">1-917-805-4581henry@feintuchpr.comliz@feintuchpr.com</email> Europe &amp; rest of the world:Thierry MeyerT: +<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:41-79-785-35-81tme@dynamicsgroup.ch\">41-79-785-35-81tme@dynamicsgroup.ch</email>  End of Media Release</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p> 1532131\u00a0\u00a011.01.2023\u00a0CET/CEST </p>", "publisher": "EQS Newsfeed (English)", "instances": ["01. 2023 / 14:00 CET/CEST PRESS RELEASE For Immediate Release Measurement, reporting and verification blockchain pioneer Open Forest Protocol raises USD 4.

On the one hand, they are already being severely impacted; on the other, they have few technological or financial resources to carry out mitigation or adaptation measures. However, there are also many opportunities in sustainable economic growth with fewer emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its 2020 report, the World Economic Forum coined the term 'New Nature Economy'. The idea is to reduce the resources a society needs to achieve prosperity, thereby protecting ecosystems.</p><p>New Nature Economy offers a broad spectrum of new business models that use innovative technology and attract private capital. Some are already successful. Ecotourism, a responsible and sustainable way to travel, is one well-known example. Various market research studies estimated the market size of ecotourism at around $ 180 billion in 2019, with an annual growth rate of approximately 10 to 15 %.</p><p>Insects as a source of protein</p><p>Another example is breeding insects as an alternative protein source for humans and animals. Edible insects have a similarly high protein content as meat, but rearing them uses significantly less space and energy compared to other livestock. At the moment they remain a niche product, but in the past two years, three insect species were approved for human consumption in the EU.</p><p>'Zero waste' has become a slogan on social media. This is how bakeries are springing up that bake fresh bread from old - and textile factories that recycle cotton and turn it into new clothes. Apps that broker leftover food from restaurants help to reduce food waste and thus protect the environment. Nature-based solutions like purifying water through plant-based purification systems are attracting the interest of investors. According to estimates by the World Economic Forum, the business potential of New Nature Economy is $ 10.1 trillion annually by 2030. It could also create 395 million jobs.</p><p>The advantage of digitalisation and technology</p><p>Based on these examples, it's clear that technologies will play a leading role in the transformation to New Nature Economy. Technological advances present a major opportunity for low-income countries. They can base their growth on significantly improved technologies, whereas industrialised countries often underwent the Industrial Revolution at the expense of the environment.</p><p>According to the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), the swift increase in emissions in low-income countries can primarily be attributed to their rising energy needs, which at the moment are still largely being covered by fossil fuels.</p><p>For a long time, high transition costs were a serious impediment to the development of renewable energies in these countries. However, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that these costs have dropped significantly over the last decade, partly due to improved technologies and competitive supply chains. For example, the IRENA database shows that the cost of electricity from photovoltaic plants dropped by 85 % between 2010 and 2020, while the cost of concentrated solar power fell by 68 % and wind power by 56 % (onshore) and 48 % (offshore).</p><p>This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Clean energy is now not only affordable, but often even more competitive than fossil fuels. The transition to renewable energy sources offers enormous potential for economically weak countries - both in terms of saving costs and emissions.</p><p>However, there are some points to consider so that renewable energies can really make the greatest possible contribution to sustainable business. For example, the production of building components for renewable energy infrastructure itself requires a great deal of energy and materials. It is important to ensure that this process leaves as small a carbon footprint as possible.</p><p>The performance of power plants based on renewable energies is strongly dependent on weather conditions. For that reason, technological innovations are essential in this area to further boost storage capacity and diversify the energy mix. They are the only way to mitigate fluctuations in electricity production due to unfavourable weather conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, social and ecological aspects must be taken into account in the planning and realisation of such power plants in order to reconcile the interests of all those involved and affected. For example, people who are to be resettled because of the construction of a hydropower plant must be fairly compensated. In the case of projects like offshore wind parks or tidal power plants, the protection of marine life must be ensured.</p><p>Smart farms and driverless trucks</p><p>In addition to the transition of energy sources, digitalisation and the use of smart climate technologies is another factor for green growth, emission reduction and the mitigation of climate risks. A 2020 study by the German digital association Bitkom shows that digital technologies could save up to 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. The greatest potential can be found in the energy, building, mobility and transportation sectors, as well as in agriculture and industry.</p><p>Innumerable innovations are already on the way. In the logistics sector, driverless electric trucks can increase the efficiency of goods transport and reduce emissions at the same time. Thanks to the quick growth of network capacity and available data, driverless trucks can find the best route, analyse traffic situations and communicate with other vehicles. Thus they can avoid traffic jams and accidents and deliver their goods more efficiently. The use of electric vehicles lowers fossil fuel consumption, and an improved traffic flow raises the quality of life, increases traffic safety and reduces emissions.</p><p>Smart farming has become a reality as well. Digital devices can analyse weather conditions, monitor plant growth, improve irrigation efficiency and reduce groundwater consumption. Drones that spray fertiliser, for example, raise dosing accuracy, lower fertiliser consumption and therefore also emissions from fertiliser production.</p><p>Intelligent building technologies have been monitoring energy consumption in homes for some time and network technical devices there. For example, they control shading, heating and cooling systems as well as lighting and can thus optimise energy consumption.</p><p>GreenTechs like Husk Power Systems are playing an increasing role in the energy sector as well. With financial support from the German development financier DEG, Husk develops and operates low-cost hybrid power plants based on renewable energies in Nigeria and India. These so-called mini-grids make it possible to use appliances such as refrigerators, fans or water treatment plants. They are a series of electricity generators and, possibly, energy storage systems that are operated as a single system and connected to a distribution grid that provides localised electricity.</p><p>However, according to the Bitkom study mentioned above, 1.8 to 3.2 % of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the production of digital devices and the operation of digital infrastructure. Therefore, it is also important for digital solutions to find a healthy balance through climate-friendly hardware production and an optimised energy mix for the high energy demand of data centres and networks.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["This is how bakeries are springing up that bake fresh bread from old - and textile factories that recycle cotton and turn it into new clothes.

VC tech specialists such as Shima Capital, \\xDCbermorgen Ventures, Not Boring Capital, Mercy Corps Ventures, Byzantine Marine, Big Brain Holdings and Valor Capital have joined with a number of angel investors in supporting the platform. Founded in 2021, OFP is already working with some 40 afforestation/reforestation projects worldwide through its revolutionary blockchain-based measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) technology. These projects will be the first in history to utilize OFP's 100% blockchain-native MRV platform.  Open Forest Protocol is an open platform allowing forest projects of any size, all over the world, to measure, report and verify their forestation data - thus creating benefits all along the value chain, from local communities on the ground to the voluntary carbon market.  Funds raised are being used to continue to build and ship the core infrastructure of the system and to ramp up the onboarding of projects across governments, NGOs and individuals.  Founded by Swiss scientist Frederic Fournier and American web3 specialist Michael Kelly, OFP brings together an international team of passionate and skilled professionals to combine expertise in environment, climate and blockchain. Prior to raising a pre-seed, OFP's original funding came from a single angel contributor.

Projects record tree data within the forest using OFP's mobile app and then send the information to be immutably stored in the open, blockchain-based registry.  In what has been an expensive, exclusive, opaque and slow system which unfortunately excludes the majority of potential projects and local communities, OFP's innovative approach is a validator network whose sole responsibility is to ensure that only valid, verifiable data passes through. This network coalesces around the ground truth data provided to the platform, and stress-tests it against the unique capabilities, data sets and technologies that validators have access to. As a result, every single data set is ultimately reviewed by dozens of entities such as validation/verification bodies (VVBs) and forest expert companies in remote sensing, environmental consulting, etc.  Fred Fournier, Open Forest Protocol CEO, said: \"The strong support of investors experienced in our pre-seed round is a validation of both our vision and strategy. Only an equitable, truthful system backed by immutable, open data will truly value forests on the ground as well as in the voluntary carbon market. We must act together to fight for our planet and give value to nature.\"  ABOUT OPEN FOREST PROTOCOL  Open Forest Protocol is an open forest measurement, reporting and verification platform built on a carbon neutral blockchain. As a public protocol, OFP has its legal seat in Zug, Switzerland, a team of developers in Ukraine, on the ground specialists in East Africa and Central America, engineers and economists in the USA, legal and managing execs in Western and Northern Europe.

To support the event, KfW is publishing a supplement in D+C/E+Z. We will post the contributions on our website. The first item is an interview with Svenja Schulze, Germany's Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to your ministry, biodiversity loss is the second global crisis the world faces after climate change. Based on this, the future of humanity also critically depends on global biodiversity. Why?</p><p>Without fertile soil, air to breathe, clean drinking water and natural resources, we can't survive, and all these things are only possible with intact ecosystems. They feed us, protect us from natural disasters and protect us from the many effects of the climate crisis. At the same time, biodiversity is suffering massively from the consequences of climate change. The climate is changing too quickly - species and ecosystems don't follow suit. This is a vicious cycle - one we urgently need to break. Development for all people, climate change mitigation and the preservation of biodiversity must be carried out in harmony. This is a challenge that I have already dealt with as Federal Minister for the Environment and on which I can now continue to work in concrete terms as Minister for Development. Our work determines the future of the planet.</p><p>Every day, up to 150 animal and plant species disappear from the earth. Why is this relevant to people's lives?</p><p>Species are dying at a pace not seen in human history. The animal and plant species affected are irrevocably lost. However, each species has an important function in an ecosystem, and with each species lost, the likelihood of the system collapsing increases. The consequences are dramatic. We are already seeing the harbingers: the hunger crisis, conflicts over scarce water, increasing heat.</p><p>The effects are putting a strain on all of us, but particularly on poor countries and vulnerable population groups - especially indigenous peoples and local communities. Their natural livelihoods are being lost and conflicts over resources are increasing. This is particularly unfair, as vulnerable population groups have contributed least to the causes of biodiversity loss.</p><p>Today, international attention is primarily focused on the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus crisis. How can more willingness to act and awareness of problems for climate change mitigation and the preservation of biodiversity be re-established worldwide?</p><p>I see it differently: Climate change mitigation receives a good deal of attention - in this Federal Government, but also in the population. Everyone is experiencing it. Climate change does not take a break, even in times of war. We just experienced a summer in Europe hotter than ever before. We are working decisively towards a liveable future for our and future generations. Climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation were top issues at the G7 meeting at Elmau Castle. At all levels, we are currently working on a successful global climate change conference in Sharm El Sheikh in November and a new global framework for biodiversity conservation, which will be decided at the UN nature summit in Montreal in December.</p><p>There are always conflicts between conservation and the fight against climate change, for example in the energy transition when building wind turbines. How can the two be combined in partner countries?</p><p>Of course, there are conflicting objectives. The partner countries deal with the same issues we do in that respect. A good balance between protection and sustainable use is necessary. The solutions are also similar, for example, checking environmental compatibility, determining environmentally friendly locations. And another vitally important factor is that these processes must involve all relevant stakeholders, especially those who are most impacted but have contributed the least: the indigenous and local populations in our partner countries. That is a question of justice. Sustainable agriculture is another important factor. And with nature-based solutions, forests, oceans and mangroves can be preserved as natural carbon sinks while simultaneously enhancing human and nature's ability to adjust to a changing climate. Naturally, conservation areas are also extremely important for the preservation of ecosystems. For example, with the Legacy Landscapes Fund, a global natural heritage fund, we recently established an important instrument to enable selected outstanding conservation areas to receive long-term 'permanent financing' and planning security that is unaffected by crises.</p><p>At the moment, global warming is continuing to progress and we continue to lose biodiversity. How optimistic are you that it is possible to successfully reverse this trend?</p><p>We have already been able to achieve a lot over the past several years. The global deforestation rate fell by a third between 2010 and 2020 in comparison with the previous decade. Protected areas already account for over 16% of land area and 8% of the oceans. Without these and other measures, two to four times as many birds, amphibians, insects and mammals would probably have died out. Our efforts are having an impact on a small scale, and we need to build on that. We still have a chance to preserve biodiversity and protect the planet from reaching the tipping point.

The climate crisis was obviously of top concern. Extreme weather events are causing increasing harm around the world. The following page gives you an overview of pertinent contributions we published in 2022.</p><p>The worst weather-related disaster hit Pakistan in the summer. About a third of the country was flooded due to unusually heavy monsoon rains. As our correspondent in Islamabad pointed out, Pakistan suffered the impacts of the human-made climate crisis, to which its people have hardly contributed. Pakistani policymakers, as Imran Mukhtar wrote, had irresponsibly failed to prepare the nation for the impacts in the course of at least a decade.</p><p>African suffering</p><p>The media pay attention to things that happen suddenly, not slow-moving developments. Therefore, many people around the world are unaware of the Horn of Africa suffering devastating drought for the third year in a row. Humanitarian relief is needed, and experience shows that it should not only be linked to longer-term development, but peacebuilding efforts as well. Our contributor Christoph Schneider-Yattara who works for the Protestant agency Bread for the World, spoke of a 'sustainable development nexus'.</p><p>As climate impacts worsen, more and more international support is needed. Burundi is one of the 20 countries that are most exposed to global heating. As a result, tens of thousands have been internally displaced in the past two years. The most important reason was flooding. State agencies and international organisations are making efforts, both to provide humanitarian assistance and to prevent further damage. On our platform, Mireille Kanyange shared her insights from Bujumbura.</p><p>All too often, smaller-scale disasters are not taken note of by international media. However, extreme weather conditions continue to haunt many parts of the world, causing local-level devastation. Agriculture is often affected. Our correspondent Ronald Ssegujja Ssekandi reported from Uganda.</p><p>Multilateral policymaking remains insufficient</p><p>Humankind has been aware of climate change for decades. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was agreed 30 years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Nonetheless, we still do not have a grip on the problems. My colleague J\u00f6rg D\u00f6bereiner assessed the results of this year's climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.</p><p>In Rio in 1992, the consensus was to focus on mitigating climate change. The idea was that adapting to the phenomenon would be too expensive, require funds that would better be used to phase out fossil fuels. As action was inadequate, the international community had to put adaptation on the global agenda some 15 years later. We now know that adaptation efforts have been insufficient too, so it has become necessary to set up a fund for losses and damages.</p><p>The good news is that competent action actually makes a difference.</p><p>How insurance schemes and governmental social protection can help</p><p>Around the world, there are good examples of what needs to be done. Insurance policies can help, and promising progress has been made in the Caribbean archipelago, which is severely exposed to hurricanes. Marjorie Pons Pi\u00f1eyro from the Dominican Republic assessed the situation for us.</p><p>More generally speaking, far too many people are not insured against climate risks, and that is especially so in low income countries. For things to change, the business environment must improve. A team of co-authors from the Munich RE foundation - Renate Bleich, Dirk Reinhard and Christian Barthelt - elaborated things on our platform.</p><p>Social protection systems help to shield vulnerable people from climate risks and reduce social disparities. The great challenge is that they tend not to exist where they are needed most. Stefan Beierl of GIZ discussed the implications in D+C/E+Z.</p><p>Physical infrastructure matters too, of course</p><p>To limit the impacts of global warming, infrastructure must improve in many places. The Ganges Delta is a region that has always been exposed to extreme weather events, and Bangladesh has made remarkable progress towards becoming climate resilient. Cyclones today claim far fewer lives than those of the past did - when the country's population was actually smaller. Md Bodrud-Doza from the Dhaka-Based International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCD) elaborated on what makes the difference.</p><p>Adaptation measures, of course, must not worsen other environmental problems. In particular, ecosystems must not be harmed. Nature-based solutions are therefore best. David Mfitumukiza of Uganda's Makerere University told my colleague J\u00f6rg D\u00f6bereiner and me about African experiences in an interview.</p><p>German development agencies such as KfW Development Bank are keenly aware of global heating and the erosion of biodiversity being mutually reinforcing. This vicious circle must be broken, argues Svenja Schulze, Germany's federal minister of economic cooperation and development.</p><p>On her behalf, these international development agencies are paying increasing attention to environmental issues. At the same time, it has become evident that domestic action is needed at home too. The food disaster in Germany's Ahr Valley in the summer of 2021 would have been less devastating had the authorities learned lessons from previous events in Germany and other countries. In regard to civil protection, Germany can take a page from other countries, as Wolf R. Dombrowsky of Steinbeis University Berlin argued on our platform.</p><p>Moving beyond denial</p><p>The USA too is increasingly hit by weather-related disasters. Wildfires, heatwaves, hurricanes and floods are becoming more frequent, more dangerous and more costly. Nonetheless, conservative forces still deny the climate crisis. Katie Cashman, a Minnesota-based environmental activist believes it would be good to stop speaking of 'natural' disasters when it is human-made climate change that is causing serious damages.</p><p>When Katie wrote her comment, US President Joe Biden's climate agenda was still stuck in the Senate. The good news is that he has managed to make Congress pass ambitious climate legislation which should achieve at least 80 % of what he had proposed. That is enough to keep alive, but more must certainly happen.</p><p>IPCC, UNEP and other multilateral bodies sound the alarm</p><p>We have seen that lagging behind what is needed to be done proves costly. The big question is: Will policymakers heed the warnings? There is no lack of scientists sounding the alarm.</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the 1.5 degree-Celsius limit will almost certainly be breached, at least temporarily. Our Indian colleague Roli Mahajan summarised its most recent global report on adaptation to global heating.</p><p>Other multilateral documents point in the same direction. Extreme weather is causing disasters. Mahwish Gul, who is based in Nairobi, read several publications of the UN Environment Programme on the matter.</p><p>We must not forget that the climate crisis is exacerbating other environmental problems. The core message of the second Global Land Outlook was that humanity must take urgent action to restore and protect land. Desertification and global heating are mutually reinforcing phenomena. Our Nigerian author Chimezie Anajama wrote about the Global Land Outlook, which was published by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).</p><p>So far, the editorial I wrote for the May issue of our Digital Monthly - the focus section dealt with extreme weather - has aged well. There really are no more excuses for not acting fast.</p><p>Hans Dembowski is the editor in chief of D+C Development and Cooperation / E+Z Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Adaptation measures, of course, must not worsen other environmental problems.

Scholars and environmental agencies keep warning that global heating is very dangerous. To change course, action must urgently be taken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global ecosystems have already changed drastically. The ice on the Arctic Ocean has been reduced by about one half since satellite measurements started four decades ago, as the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reported in its Foresight Brief 28 in January this year. Should temperatures keep rising at current rates, UNEP expects the Arctic Ocean to be free of ice by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trend is evident in the Antarctica too. Since 1979, satellites never detected as little ice as today. The ice shield used to be thicker and extend further.</p><p>At the same time, forest fires are happening more often - even in areas, where they used to be quite rare. Increasing aridity, hot air, dry lightning and strong winds lead to longer fire seasons. In recent years, Australia's East and the US west coast saw unprecedented and devastating blazes. If greenhouse-gas emissions are not reduced, disastrous wildfires may increase by one third until 2050 and even two thirds until the end of the century, according to a recent UNEP report (2022, 2) on the matter.</p><p>Changing water cycles</p><p>In eastern Africa satellites currently register the worst heat and the least rainfall since the technology was introduced. Some 25 million people are reckoned to be exposed to food and water insecurity (see Christoph Schneider-Yattara on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Water cycles are changing, making arid areas even drier. Devastating droughts are currently affecting parts of Latin America and western Asia too. According to a report on water published by the World Meteorological Organization (2021), 70 countries suffer drought in an average year.</p><p>On the other hand, torrential rains are haunting other parts of the world. South Africa recently saw its rainiest season in history - and it caused deadly flooding. In Sydney, Australia, this March was the wettest on record. Flash floods proved devastating. For the eastern USA, for example, 2021 was an unusually wet year. In India, there was 129 % more rain last September than normal. 2020 was the United Kingdom's fifth wettest year, and six of the 10 wettest years occurred in the past 20 years.</p><p>Around the world, the number of flood disasters has increased by 134 % since the year 2000, according to the World Meteorological Organization, whereas the number and duration of droughts increased by 29 %.</p><p>1.5\u00b0 threshold</p><p>In its 6th Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, due to human activity, global temperatures have risen by 1.1 \u00b0C since the industrial revolution began. Most likely, the threshold of 1.5\u00b0 will be breached (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres stated in his foreword, 'we are on a fast track to climate disaster.' He made an emphatic call to world leaders that 'it is time to stop burning our planet and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us.'</p><p>Scientists warn that global heating will spin out of control and escalate irreversibly if we pass certain tipping points. Cascading impacts would thus result from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet, the end of Ocean currents or the destruction of the Amazon rain forest.</p><p>To get a grip on the climate crisis, 195 countries concluded the Paris Agreement on Climate Change seven years ago. The stated goal was to keep global warming 'well below two degrees' and, if possible, stay within 1.5\u00b0. Governments committed to drafting and implement actioning plans with nationally determined contributions to global climate action.</p><p>When the Glasgow climate summit took stock last year, failure was generally acknowledged. Assessing the summit result in a press release, for example, UNEP declared that the new and updated commitments of 120 countries would only reduce the emissions forecast for 2030 by 7.5 %. To limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0, 55 % would be needed.</p><p>The way forward</p><p>According to UNEP's most recent emissions gap report, ten large economies account for two thirds of global greenhouse-gas emissions. China, the EU (counted as a single economy) and the USA are responsible for 41.5 %. UNEP insists that climate protection hinges on action in these huge markets - and that it is still possible to stabilise the global climate.</p><p>Nature-based solutions, renewable energies and energy efficiency all have great potential, according to UNEP. At the same time, forests and other eco-systems must be restored. The UN agency makes it quite clear that investments in fossil fuels must stop, subsidies for fossil fuels must stop and ultimately the usage of fossil must stop too.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["5 %.

The term 'green recovery' sounds promising, but does not accurately describe what is happening. David Mfitumukiza of Makerere University in Kampala assessed matters in our interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What impacts of the climate crisis are currently hurting people in East Africa?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are three main hazards: drought, flooding and shifting seasons. The third is actually the most important for nature-economies where agriculture is the dominant sector. Unfortunately, it is getting the least attention. Changing weather patterns reduce food production and incomes. Subsistence farming is affected worse, because smallholders cannot afford to invest in new equipment or inputs. They have no wiggle room. Of course, the impact on commercial farms is bad too. When drought or floods occur, they are often devastating of course. People in some parts of Kenya and neighbouring regions in Ethiopia and Somalia are currently suffering food insecurity because rainfall was erratic and insufficient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What does Covid-19 mean in this context?</p><p>Well, the pandemic is not over, so it's impossible to give a conclusive assessment (see Ben Ezeamalu on our D+C/E+Z platform). Several things are evident nonetheless. \u00acPoverty has increased. The urban poor could not work during lockdowns. Food distribution suffered because markets had to close. Fresh produce could thus not be distributed, and prices dropped dramatically. For example, a bunch of bananas that previously would have fetched the equivalent of four US dollars suddenly was only worth ten cents. In our world region, moreover, rural-urban dynamics matter very much. Typically, people who live in the villages depend on some kind of financial report from relatives or well-wishers in the cities. In times when poverty gets worse in urban areas, it therefore gets worse in rural areas too. Moreover, public services deteriorated, especially in rural \u00acareas where they were weak to begin with.</p><p>What are the environmental consequences?</p><p>The pressure on marginal land has been increasing faster than it usually would. Village people are desperate to expand their fields. A certain pressure exists all the time as all countries in the East African Community have population growth rates of at least 2.3?%. Because of the pandemic, however, we lost even more forest, grasslands and wetlands than we normally would. Those losses always weaken ecosystems, not least because they further reduce biodiversity, and one consequence is that nature's resilience to climate change keeps dwindling. At the same time, carbon is released into the atmosphere, so the climate crisis is further exacerbated. In our part of the world, poverty, population growth and the global environmental crisis are mutually reinforcing phenomena. Coronavirus has made everything worse.</p><p>Do African countries need stimulus programmes to improve matters in the sense of a green recovery or a green new deal? The guiding idea is to do two things at once: fight poverty and support the transition to a sustainable economy.</p><p>We certainly need the economy to recover and to get people out of the pit. I am not sure, however, that 'green recovery' is a term that describes what is happening. Our governments are focusing on getting the economy started again. That is their top priority. They do not worry much about environmental sustainability. We certainly still need economic growth if we want to reduce poverty, but it is unfortunately less obvious to everyone - at least in the short term - that growth must be environmentally sustainable. Our systems of governance tend to be weak, but only strong systems are able to take longer-term trends into account. In least-developed countries (LDCs), public finances are generally stretched. That means that the scope for stimulus programmes is very small, which in turn reinforces the disposition to think in the short term.</p><p>So when governments do consider environmental issues, they are probably more interested in adaptation to climate change than in mitigation?</p><p>Yes, the thinking is that African countries have contributed very little to causing global heating so they cannot do much to control that problem. At the same time, LDCs are especially exposed to the impacts, so everyone understands that we must adapt. This reasoning is flawed however. Yes, it is true that, in our countries, transportation, power generation and industries do not emit huge quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. However, deforestation, the loss of wetlands and the degradation of ecosystems in general do contribute to the climate crisis. Our contribution to mitigation should be to stop those trends.</p><p>And what can a country like Uganda do to adapt to a hotter climate?</p><p>There's a lot we can do. When infrastructure was built in the past, weather risks did not get much attention. That has changed. Today, potential flooding is slowly being considered in the planning and construction of cross-country roads. In similar ways, we can make sure that infrastructure such as power supply stays operational in cases of excessive rainfall or unusual heat. In regard to agriculture, a lot can be done as well. Small-scale irrigation schemes are most valuable, they often involve water harvesting. By storing water when it rains, we can boost farming in general and considerably reduce the impact of drought. African governments are aware of these things, so they feature in national adaptation plans. Nature-based solutions are the best options because they are very cost-effective and typically contribute to climate mitigation as well as adaptation.</p><p>Please tell us more about nature-based \u00acsolutions?</p><p>Well, many communities depend on natural resources, so communities' resilience typically depends on the resilience of the ecosystems they live in. Ultimately, this is about making people's livelihoods compatible with sustainable land use, instead of only trying to maximise the output of agriculture in the short term by adopting supposedly modern technologies (see article by Susanne Neubert on our D+C/E+Z platform). A very promising project is the Adaptation Fund Wetlands Restoration Project, which is implemented by Uganda\u00b4s Ministry of Water and Environment. The local people are directly involved, and they are keen on making things work out because they understand just how important the natural resources are. Of course, grasslands, forests and savannahs deserve attention too.</p><p>Let's return to the topic of stimulus programmes. High-income nations have invested trillions of dollars, but low-income nations cannot afford government spending of that kind. What international assistance do you need?</p><p>Well, we certainly need funding. Whether you call it climate finance, official development assistance or debt relief does not matter much. Money is not everything however. As I said earlier, systems of governance matter very much. They must ensure that money flows to where it is needed most - grassroots communities. Funding from international agencies should therefore go along with technical cooperation to boost state capacities. International agencies should not only talk to national governments; they must also pay attention to community-based organisations who know best what is needed in terms of infrastructure, health care, education, public services et cetera. Central governments generally understand that international support which we need can actually reach the places where the impacts are felt. In fact, there is an initiative started by LDCs governments to promote this cause. It is called the LDC Initiative for Effective Adaptation and Resilience (LIFE-AR). It was signed by national governments, but the programme is designed to support local governments in building effective systems and financing mechanisms to boost grassroot resilience.</p><p>Bilateral and multilateral agencies cannot bypass state agencies when they attempt to deliver support. Unfortunately, they do not find powerful sub-national partners everywhere as easily as in Kenya, where county governors are quite influential.</p><p>Yes, it is important to decentralise governance, and again, technical cooperation can help. On the other hand, cross-border thinking is needed too. In Africa, traditional community life largely ignores national borders. Nomadic communities move from place to place, and in times of crisis, other people start fleeing to relatives, who may live in a different country. In such settings, support for a specific communities in need should not be limited to a single country. More generally speaking, policymakers should always pay attention to these things. We are dealing with global problems and certainly need international solutions.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["By storing water when it rains, we can boost farming in general and considerably reduce the impact of drought.

(MA) said Tuesday it has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050.   The company's global action plan aims to continue to reduce greenhouse gases or GHG by remaining focused on the decarbonization of its operations and bolstering its efforts to decarbonize its supply chains.  Mastercard noted that its net zero goal builds upon its existing GHG commitments that align with the Business Ambition for 1.5C pledge.   Mastercard has gained Science Based Targets initiative or SBTi approval for its GHG goals. The company is currently working towards its SBTi-approved goal to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38 percent, and Scope 3 emissions by 20 percent by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.  The company has already achieved 100 percent renewable electricity in 2020, reinforced by a commitment to RE100.   Mastercard said it will initially focus on two priority areas to make progress against its emissions targets - decarbonizing its own operations and leading on supplier sustainability.  Mastercard operates close to 180 facilities across the world and is prioritizing renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. This includes the expanded use of solar panels in data centers, which account for more than 50 percent of energy usage across the company.   Currently all Mastercard owned properties in the U.S. are fitted with solar panels and all owned properties across the world are LEED certified.  In the future, Mastercard will also review opportunities for investing in carbon removal projects. This includes new nature-based solutions as well as technologies and services that reduce carbon impact as well as support broader local economic and social development goals.  In addition, Mastercard is mobilizing its technology, expertise, and global partnerships network to lead on collective climate action, through initiatives such as the Greener Payments Partnership and the Priceless Planet Coalition.      </p>", "publisher": "dpa-AFX International ProFeed", "instances": ["are fitted with solar panels and all owned properties across the world are LEED certified.

That analysis showed that there is a broad consensus on the need for such programmes and their benefits within the scientific community and at international organisations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Studies confirm that green programmes can be very effective drivers of economic recovery, sometimes even more effective than conventional measures. For example, investment in renewable energy pays off more in macroeconomic terms than state support for fossil fuels. Investment in nature conservation, too, can have a very high multiplier effect, meaning that it generates high impacts on demand and employment. Money spent on unsustainable land use, on the other hand, tends to have a negative impact on an economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Criteria for green measures</p><p>There is widespread agreement in the scientific community on the criteria that green stimulus measures should meet. It is important that they:</p><p>are feasible in the short run,</p><p>have a high impact on demand and employment (targeted),</p><p>place only a temporary strain on state budgets (temporary) and</p><p>make a positive contribution to socio-ecological transformation (see Sabine Balk's article on the need for a socio-ecological transformation on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Some economic areas are particularly suitable for sustainable recovery programmes. They include non-fossil energy production, energy-efficient building renovation, sustainable mobility and measures for the ecological transformation of industry. The last area mentioned encompasses, for example, the development of a hydrogen-based economy and the promotion of technologies to increase energy and material efficiency. Climate adaptation measures and nature-based solutions such as reforestation are also often rated very highly.</p><p>Which particular measures can be feasibly implemented depends partly on country-specific circumstances, such as economic structure and administrative, technical and financial capacities, and partly on the availability of projects that are already planned and can be swiftly implemented.</p><p>Evaluations of existing green recovery programmes show significant differences. In industrialised countries the range of support areas is very broad, whereas in emerging economies and developing countries the focus is often solely on the development of renewable energy - especially solar energy - and preservation of the natural capital stock, for example economically important ecosystem services such as forests or marine sanctuaries.</p><p>Just a flash in the pan</p><p>Studies on green economic recovery programmes launched during the 2008/2009 financial and economic crisis show that they might only have a momentary effect. For example, although global greenhouse gas emissions declined slightly in 2009, they rose sharply again in 2010. The main reasons for the upturn were low energy prices and high government spending on fossil fuel-based activities.</p><p>Therefore, it is necessary to check all economic stimulus measures for environmentally harmful and climate-damaging effects and to embed green recovery programmes in structural reforms. This includes dismantling environmentally harmful subsidies and implementing carbon pricing. In addition, regulatory barriers need to be removed and green investment targets set.</p><p>It is also important to promote green financial instruments, build green infrastructures such as charging points for electric vehicles, expand public transport networks and power grids, and launch training programmes so that the social and ecological transformation is not hampered by a shortage of skilled workers.</p><p>Policy-making is lagging behind</p><p>More than two years after the onset of the corona crisis, questions need to be addressed about the extent to which policy-makers heeded the recommendations of the scientific community and the scale on which green economic recovery programmes were implemented. The answer is sobering: from a global perspective, green recovery measures played a minor role to combat the corona crisis.</p><p>The Global Recovery Observatory - a platform created by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), IMF and GIZ to promote knowledge exchange and green fiscal policy - tracks countries' COVID-19 recovery spending. It estimates that total spending worldwide on measures to address the crisis amounted to around US$ 18 trillion (as of August 2022), most of which went on short-term rescue efforts. Only a little over US$ 3 trillion was longer-term recovery spending and less than a third of that was used to fund green programmes.</p><p>Even so, compared to the 2008/2009 financial crisis the importance of green economic recovery measures has increased significantly. Evidence of this can be seen, among other places, in many EU countries, partly as a result of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility earmarking considerable financial resources for green measures.</p><p>Green recovery spending has been confined to relatively few countries, most of them in the industrialised world. This is largely due to the fact that the financial resources of developing and emerging economies are much more limited. In 2020, per capita spending on recovery programmes in industrial countries was 17 times higher than in developing and emerging economies. This shows how important debt relief and targeted financial support by the industrialised world is. They empower developing and emerging nations, too, to implement green programmes.</p><p>Moreover, green programmes' positive impacts on the environment are often counteracted by negative impacts from other stimulus measures. The IMF found that in the Group of 20 leading economic nations (G20), 1.4% of corona spending in 2020 had a positive climate impact, while 1.7% was harmful to the climate. Analyses by the Global Recovery Observatory conclude that only 3% of expenditures on economic recovery have a positive effect on the natural capital stock but 17% of spending has a negative impact. With regard to the goal of air pollution control, the positive and negative impacts are more or less equal. These are shocking findings and underline the importance of applying environmental and sustainability checks to all stimulus measures.</p><p>Whether the world as a whole will emerge from the crisis greener as a result of the corona programmes that have been implemented is impossible to say at this stage. It is too early to make a final judgement because programmes are still ongoing and quantitative impact studies are hardly available.</p><p>Because of the war in Ukraine, the world is now once again in an economic crisis. And the measures taken in response to that crisis will again be decisive. If the sharp rise in fossil fuel prices is used as an opportunity to promote energy efficiency, green energy and post-fossil production technologies, the crisis could become a catalyst for sustainable development. Developing countries and emerging economies urgently need support in this regard because the constraints on their financial capacities have been even intensified by the current surge in energy and food prices and the economic crisis.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the response to sharply rising fossil fuel prices and gas supply shortages is to subsidise fossil fuels even more and to develop new sources of fossil fuels, the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement will hardly be achievable any more.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["They include non-fossil energy production, energy-efficient building renovation, sustainable mobility and measures for the ecological transformation of industry.

The report highlights important steps that Shell has taken to advance its energy transition strategy. These include significant investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG), which Shell expects to remain an important part of the energy mix for many years to come, partly because of its role in reducing emissions from power generation and transport. Other steps include Shell's $1.6 billion investment in Indian renewable power developer Sprng Energy, and the final investment decision on the Holland Hydrogen 1 project in the Netherlands, which will be Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant. In 2022, Shell also announced the acquisition of Denmark's Nature Energy, which produces renewable natural gas, for around $2 billion. This deal was completed at the beginning of 2023. Shell also increased the number of electric vehicle charge points it owned or operated worldwide by 62% to around 139,000 in 2022, up from 86,000 the previous year. Sir Andrew Mackenzie, Shell Chair, said: \"We believe the progress we have made in line with our energy transition strategy has been to the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and wider society.\" This progress comes at a time when the energy system still faces challenges as high energy prices continue to contribute to a cost-of-living crisis for many people. These challenges have highlighted the need for a balanced energy transition: one in which the world achieves net-zero emissions, while still providing a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's energy transition strategy was put to an advisory shareholder vote at its 2021 Annual General Meeting, where it secured 89% of the vote.

This report aims to    update shareholders and wider society on how Shell has progressed in 2022    against the energy transition strategy we announced in 2021.        Chair's message        Chief Executive Officer's introduction        Steps on the path to net-zero emissions        Our progress towards net zero        Carbon performance at a glance Chair's message   Sir Andrew Mackenzie, Chair Our second Energy Transition Progress Report comes as the Russian war in Ukraine continues to have a devastating effect on the lives of many. The conflict has also highlighted the need for a global supply of secure and affordable energy. Amid this period of heightened uncertainty, we have worked hard to keep energy flowing to households and businesses around the world. In 2022, I witnessed first-hand how our staff diverted energy supplies to where they were most needed. In total, we delivered 194 cargoes of liquefied natural gas to Europe - almost five times our usual average. This work helped to avert the threat of blackouts and to build up energy supplies ahead of next winter. Against this backdrop, we made good progress in putting our energy transition strategy into action. As we delivered the oil and gas the world needs today, we reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 30% by the end of 2022, compared with 2016 on a net basis. This is more than halfway towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030. Global energy-related carbon emissions increased by around 4% over the same period. [A] We continued to work towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 by making significant investments in solar and wind power, biofuels and hydrogen. For example, we made our biggest acquisition in the energy transition yet with the purchase of Denmark's Nature Energy for around $2 billion. This acquisition makes us Europe's largest producer of renewable natural gas, which is made from agricultural, industrial and household waste. Renewable natural gas can be used by customers in sectors such as commercial road transport and shipping. This is part of the work we are undertaking, sector by sector, to identify the low- and zero-carbon products that our customers need to reduce their emissions. We continued to build infrastructure to help our customers switch to low- and zero-carbon energy. In 2022, for example, we increased the number of electric vehicle chargers we owned or operated by 62% to around 139,000, compared with the previous year. The development of new technologies is vital to decarbonising our own operations, as well as reducing the emissions for our customers. In 2022, we launched the Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam in the Netherlands, which creates an opportunity for Shell and other companies to research new technologies for the energy transition. Engaging with shareholders The continued support of our shareholders is critical to Shell's success as a company. In 2021, shareholders supported our energy transition strategy with 89% of the votes. In contrast, a resolution by shareholder group Follow This calling for a different energy transition strategy received 30% of the votes. Shareholders will get the opportunity to vote again on our strategy in 2024. In 2022, 80% of our shareholders voted in support of the progress we had made in 2021 in implementing our energy transition strategy. Along with other Board members, I met many of our largest investors following that vote, including during investor engagements in September. I am grateful for their time and feedback, and look forward to our next engagements in April 2023. The publication of annual progress reports, along with the advisory votes, have resulted in a more informed dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard, for example, that some large investors did not follow the Board's recommendation to vote in support of Shell's progress in 2022, because they mainly focused on Shell's energy transition strategy overall, and not on our progress. Some shareholders also indicated that societal pressure, potential media coverage, and expectations from investors in their funds were reasons for not following the Board's recommendation. Other investors told us they would like Shell to introduce medium-term targets to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions produced by customers when they use our products. The Board has considered setting a Scope 3 absolute emissions target but has found it would be against the financial interests of our shareholders and would not help to mitigate global warming. This year, we are again asking shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on the progress we have made in 2022 as we implement our energy transition strategy. As in previous years, this vote on our progress measured against our targets and plans is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe the progress we have made in line with our energy transition strategy has been to the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and wider society. The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 25 in support of the energy transition progress that Shell made in 2022, as described in this report and in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022. [A] According to our analysis and data from the International Energy Agency. Chief Executive Officer's introduction   Wael Sawan, Chief Executive Officer The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had significant effects on the global energy system, with many countries needing to replace the supplies of natural gas that previously came from Russia. Governments acted swiftly. The European Union's REPowerEU plan and the Inflation Reduction Act in the USA gave strong support to renewable energy. In Germany, two floating storage and regasification terminals were up and running by the end of the year, allowing the country to import more of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) it needs. But the energy system still faces huge challenges as high energy prices continue to contribute to a cost-of-living crisis for many people. These challenges have highlighted the need for a balanced energy transition: one in which the world achieves net-zero emissions, while still providing a secure and affordable supply of energy. Supplying vital energy In this report, we show the progress we have made towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, as we continue to supply the vital energy the world needs during a time of great volatility. I am especially proud of the progress we have made in reducing carbon emissions from our operations, with a 30% reduction by the end of 2022, compared with 2016 on a net basis. That puts us more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030. We also continued to change the energy mix of our portfolio. By the end of 2022, the net carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell had fallen by 3.8%, compared with 2016. Our analysis, using data from the International Energy Agency, shows the net carbon intensity of the global energy system fell by around 2% over that time [A]. Beyond our immediate performance against our targets, we have taken other important steps to advance our strategy. In LNG, for example, we expanded what is already a world-leading business. We expect that LNG will play a key role in a balanced energy transition. It produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, and fewer emissions than petrol or diesel when used as a fuel for transport. In 2022, we joined two exciting projects in Qatar, including what will be the largest LNG project in the world. These projects will use carbon capture and storage, helping to reduce emissions. Investing in low-carbon projects At the same time, we made significant moves to increase our supply of low- and zero-carbon energy, in line with our strategy. In 2022, we invested $1.6 billion in Indian renewable power developer Sprng Energy. We also announced the acquisition of Denmark's Nature Energy, which produces renewable natural gas from agricultural, industrial and household waste, for around $2 billion. Our Powering Progress strategy is designed to transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. We will use the strength of our brand, customer relationships and balance sheet to add value to these acquisitions. With Nature Energy, for example, we expect to make strong returns from our investment because we already have customers for biofuels in commercial road transport and shipping, and the trading expertise to connect opportunities in supply and demand. [A] For more details see shell.com/energytransitionfaq Similarly, the strength of our integrated portfolio gives us confidence in our investment in Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant. The power for the electrolyser will come from an offshore wind farm that is partly owned by Shell. The renewable hydrogen will be used at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to help decarbonise the production of products like petrol, diesel and aviation fuel. Renewable hydrogen can also be used for commercial road transport, a sector where we already have a leading position in Europe. Building on our strengths In 2022, we invested $8.2 billion in low-carbon energy and non-energy products, around a third of our total cash capital expenditure. Of that, we invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, including biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles and renewable power generation. The remaining $3.9 billion was spent on non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our customers. As we invest in the energy transition, we will continue to build on our competitive strengths. We will earn the trust of investors and the right to grow these emerging businesses by demonstrating that we can deliver strong returns. Shareholder support In 2021, 89% of shareholders at our Annual General Meeting voted in favour of Shell's energy transition strategy, which centres on our target to become a net- zero emissions energy business by 2050. As you will read in this report, we have made good progress in the first two years of that strategy by reducing emissions from our operations, and by making more low- and zero-carbon products available to our customers. Today, I ask our shareholders for their continued support, by voting in favour of the progress we are making on our journey to net-zero emissions. Steps on the path to net-zero emissions In 2023, for the second time, we are offering shareholders an advisory vote on our progress in implementing our energy transition strategy.

Our Progress in 2022 towards net zero Our performance Reduced Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions by 30% More than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030, compared to 2016 on a net basis Reduced net carbon intensity by 3.8% Achieved 2022 target of 3-4% reduction, making progress towards reducing our net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050, compared to 2016 Invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, and $3.9 billion in non- energy products Providing our customers with more electricity   * Increased electric vehicle charge points by 62% to around 139,000   * More than doubled renewable generation capacity to 6.4 GW   * Acquired Sprng Energy, a leading renewable power platform (India)   * Integrated Savion, a solar and energy storage developer (USA)   * Won offshore wind bids (NL, UK, USA) Developing renewable hydrogen   * Took final investment decision for Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands     (200 MW electrolyser capacity)   * Added 20 MW electrolyser capacity in China   * Growing our biofuels portfolio   * Blended 9.5 billion litres of biofuels (6% of global consumption)   * Acquired Nature Energy (Denmark), the largest producer of renewable natural     gas in Europe   * Signed large, long-term agreement to buy ethanol made from sugar-cane waste     from Ra\\xEDzen (Brazil) Providing conventional fuels   * Selected as partner in 2 large LNG projects with carbon capture and storage     in Qatar   * Delivered 194 LNG cargoes to Europe (almost five times our usual average) Carbon performance at a glance Our carbon targets for absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions and net carbon intensity In 2022, we continued to make progress towards our 2030 targets. By the end of 2022, we had reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 30%, compared with our 2016 reference year on a net basis. The net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell decreased by 3.8%, compared with our 2016 reference year. This reduction in net carbon intensity reflects an increase in sales of low- and zero-carbon energy, helping our customers to decarbonise their energy use.

Operational control boundary.  B. Reference year.  C. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from the upstream assets we     operate and to have kept methane emissions intensity of Shell-operated     assets under 0.2% by 2025.  D. Shell's NCI is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the     energy products sold by Shell. Estimated total greenhouse gas (GHG)     emissions included in NCI (net) correspond to well-to-wheel emissions     associated with energy products sold by Shell, on an equity boundary, net of     carbon credits. This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the     manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. Emissions     associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are     excluded.  E. 2021 target 2-3% reduction, 2022 target 3-4% reduction, both achieved.  F. There was a decrease in 2020 from 2019 related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes with     effect from January 2020. We estimate that netting of oil products sales     volumes resulted in a reduction in GHG emissions of 102 million tonnes     CO(2)e For more details of climate-related definitions and methodologies, please see our Annual Report and Accounts    Our    Performance    Read about our performance against our climate targets and how we are    working to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.        Absolute emissions        Net carbon intensity        Net carbon intensity        Reducing carbon intensity Absolute emissions Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we are transforming how we produce energy. In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into low-carbon energy and     chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. Following divestment activity in 2022, we expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2023 and 2030 and that they will exceed reductions associated with planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030. ---- Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A],[B]   Emissions     2016     2019     2020     2021     2022     2030               actual   actual   actual   actual   actual   target -------------   Scope 1         72       70       63       60       51   Scope 2         11       10        8        8        7   Total           83       80       71       68       58       41   Reduction                                         -30%     -50% ------------------------------------------------------  Indication of how we expect to achieve our 2030      Expected impact of action  target ------------------------------------------------------  Portfolio changes                                    Increase  Efficiency improvements                              Decrease  Energy and chemicals park transformation             Decrease  Use of renewable power                               Decrease  Carbon capture and storage                           Decrease  Carbon credits [C]                                   Decrease  A.

Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Absolute emissions progress In 2022, our total combined Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (from assets and activities under our operational control) were 58 million tonnes on a CO(2) equivalent basis, a 15% reduction compared with 2021, and a 30% reduction compared with 2016, the reference year. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) decreased from 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2021 to 51 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2022. This reduction was achieved through divestments in 2021 and 2022 (such as the Deer Park and Puget Sound refineries in the USA) and the handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; shutdowns or conversion of existing assets, including the shutdown of some units at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore; GHG abatement projects and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by the commissioning of Shell Polymers Monaca. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. To date, we have not used carbon credits to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions changes from 2016 to 2021 and  from 2021 to 2022  million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO?e) +-------+----------+-------------------------------------------------+---------+ |Period |Emissions |                     Changes                     |Emissions| |       |[A] in    +------------+-----------+-----------+------+-----+[A] in   | |       |first year|Acquisitions|Divestments|Reduction  |Change|Other|last year| |       |of period |            |           |activities |in    |     |of period| |       |          |            |           |and        |output|     |         | |       |          |            |           |purchased  |[F]   |     |         | |       |          |            |           |renewable  |      |     |         | |       |          |            |           |electricity|      |     |         | |       |          |            |           |[B] [C] [D]|      |     |         | |       |          |            |           |[E]        |      |     |         | +-------+----------+------------+-----------+-----------+------+-----+---------+ |2016 to|          |            |           |           |      |     |         | |2021   |        83|         5.0|     (15.4)|      (9.2)|   6.6|(2.3)|       68| +-------+----------+------------+-----------+-----------+------+-----+---------+ |2021 to|          |            |           |           |      |     |         | |2022   |        68|         0.0|      (7.5)|      (2.0)| (0.9)|  0.4|       58| +-------+----------+------------+-----------+-----------+------+-----+---------+  A.

Methane emissions Methane emissions are included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting. In 2022, we reduced total methane emissions from our operations by 27% to 40,000 tonnes, compared with 55,000 tonnes in 2021. Our target to keep methane emissions intensity below 0.2% was met in 2022 with Shell's overall methane emissions intensity at 0.05% for facilities with marketing gas and 0.01% for facilities without marketing gas. Routine flaring In 2022, routine flaring from our upstream operations fell to 0.1 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Our aim is to eliminate routine gas flaring from our upstream operations by 2025.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    We undertake external verification of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions    annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under    our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our    energy products (Scope 3) included in our net carbon intensity have been    verified to a level of limited assurance.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net carbon intensity We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress in changing the mix of energy products we sell to customers. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services -- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Net carbon intensity measures the transformation that is happening in our portfolio as we implement our energy transition strategy. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is the same as achieving 100% reduction in net carbon intensity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. [A] Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. Aligning our targets with Paris Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5\\xB0C pathway derived from the scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\\xB0C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we have developed our own approach for demonstrating Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets within a pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. This pathway is aligned with the more ambitious temperature goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. When constructing the pathway, we started by filtering out certain scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions. Next, we calculated the carbon intensity (grammes of CO(2)/MJ of energy) for each of the remaining scenarios by dividing net emissions by total final energy consumption, with electricity represented as a fossil fuel equivalent. To set a starting point, we then indexed the resulting carbon intensities to a common value of 100 in 2016 to remove the impact of differences between Shell's historical net carbon intensity and the intensities calculated from the IPCC scenarios. Finally, the pathway was constructed using the range of carbon intensity reductions over time. Outlying values at the top and bottom of the range were removed, which had the effect of narrowing the final pathway. By using the 1.5\\xB0C pathway produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5\\xB0C scenarios. This is illustrated in the table, which shows that our targets are positioned within the range of the 1.5\\xB0C pathway. The upper and lower limits represent the upper and lower boundaries of the 1.5\\xB0C pathway derived using the approach described above. -------------------------------------------------------------------------   Shell's Paris-aligned targets                            +------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+                            | 2023 |  2024 |  2025 | 2030 | 2035 |  2050 | +--------------------------+------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+ | IPCC-derived upper range |  -4% |   -5% |   -7% | -15% | -34% |  -68% | +--------------------------+------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+ | IPCC-derived lower range | -10% |  -13% |  -17% | -36% | -64% | -104% | +--------------------------+------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+ | Shell target range       | 6-8% | 9-12% | 9-13% |  20% |  45% |  100% | +--------------------------+------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+ Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell, such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks. Any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers is also part of our calculation. After that date, we include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers. This is because we expect that customers will need to take action to mitigate their emissions from the use of our products if society is to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build new protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Currently, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those products. However, when users of energy products mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by the use of carbon capture and storage or offsets there is no protocol for reflecting a corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reported by the energy supplier. We will continue to engage stakeholders on these carbon protocols and will seek to align with new frameworks as they evolve. As an energy provider, Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 20% by 2030. We believe that this target is aligned with a 1.5\\xB0C pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. We also believe that the pace of change will vary around the world by region and by sector, taking into consideration the time needed for energy users to invest in large-scale equipment, and the energy infrastructure changes needed for Shell to deliver more low- and zero-carbon energy. Reducing carbon intensity The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart below illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. ---- Working to reduce our net carbon intensity Net carbon intensity in gCO(2)e/MJ [A]                                                    +------+------+------+------+                                                    |2016  |2021  |2022  |2030  |                                                    +------+------+------+------+                                                    |Actual|Actual|Actual|Target| +--------------------------------------------------+------+------+------+------+ |Net carbon Intensity                              |79    |77    |76    |63    | +--------------------------------------------------+------+------+------+------+ |Net carbon intensity reduction                    |      |      |-3.8% |-20%  | +--------------------------------------------------+------+------+------+------+ +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ |Levers to reduce our net carbon intensity between |Action                     | |the end of 2022 and 2030                          |                           | +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ |Hydrocarbon sales [B]                             |                           | +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ |Electricity sales [C]                             |Grow power sales           | +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ |Low-carbon fuels sales [D]                        |Grow biofuels, develop     | |                                                  |hydrogen                   | +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ |Carbon capture and storage [E]                    |Develop CCS                | +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ |Carbon credits [F]                                |High quality carbon credits| +--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+  A.

Carbon intensity performance In 2022, Shell's NCI was 76 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 1.3% decrease from the previous year and a 3.8% reduction compared with 2016, the reference year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2022 was primarily due to an increased proportion of renewable power and corresponding reduction in the carbon intensity of our power sales. Shell's 2022 NCI includes 4.1 million tonnes of carbon credits, compared with 5.1 million tonnes which were included in Shell's 2021 NCI. The net carbon intensity only includes carbon credits that are retired against energy products. ---- Share of energy delivered per energy product type [A]-[F]  Energy product   2016 Share 2020 Share 2021 Share 2022 Share 2022 carbon  type                                                         intensity                                                               (gCO2e/MJ)  Oil products and 54%        47%        45%        44%        91  gas-to-liquids  (GTL)  Gas              24%        21%        25%        22%        65  Liquefied        14%        19%        18%        20%        70  natural gas  Biofuels         1%         1%         1%         1%         39  Power            7%         12%        12%        12%        58  A.

These will have the potential to generate around 7.3 GW (Shell share 3.7 GW). The UK joint venture will develop two of the world's first floating wind farms off the east coast of Scotland, which are expected to be operational in the early 2030s. In 2022, we also made strong progress in rolling out our electric vehicle (EV) charging network to 28 countries, making it easier for motorists around the world to reduce their emissions. We increased the number of EV charge points we own or operate by 62% to around 139,000 in 2022, up from around 86,000 the previous year. In November 2022, we completed our acquisition of German company SBRS GmbH, which provides electric charging services for buses, trucks and vans. It will allow us to offer more charging services to business customers who need to decarbonise their fleets and improve their depot charging capabilities. Renewable power generation and the marketing and trading of power sit within our Renewables and Energy Solutions business segment.

Through our Accelerate    to Zero programme, Shell is providing on-the-go and home charging for    electric vehicles, as well as other fleet solutions, for SAP employees in    several countries. At SAP's headquarters in Walldorf, Germany, we are    working to build solar generation capacity to help the company decarbonise    and become more self-reliant in its energy use.    In 2022, we also helped wine producer Treasury Wine Estates get closer to    achieving its net-zero target and become a renewable energy producer by    installing 9,500 solar panels on rooftops and on the ground at two of its    Australian sites. These solar panels are expected to generate more than    5,500 megawatt-hours of electricity a year. Shell Energy is working with    Treasury Wine Estates, which has 13,000 hectares of vineyards around the    world, to provide renewable energy across the company's operations. A    further 9,000 solar panels are being installed at its California    vineyards.

It is particularly suitable for use in hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy-duty transport, heavy industry, shipping and aviation because of its high energy density. We are increasing our investment in the production and supply of hydrogen. In July 2022, we took the final investment decision to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant once operational. The 200 MW electrolyser will produce up to 80 tonnes of renewable hydrogen a day, enough to meet up to 10% of the annual hydrogen demand from Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam.

By the end of 2022, our total electrolyser capacity was 30 MW. This is about 6% of the global capacity of installed electrolysers in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Hydrogen is not yet widely used by motorists or commercial road transport customers. We have more than 50 hydrogen retail sites in Europe and North America, where drivers can fill up their vehicles with hydrogen fuel. To encourage some commercial road transport customers to gain experience with hydrogen, we ordered 25 hydrogen trucks (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itsinternational.com/daily-\">https://www.itsinternational.com/daily-</url> news/its-world-congress-2021/shell-introduces-fuel-cell-truck) in Germany.

In 2022, research and development expenditure on projects that    contributed to decarbonisation was around $440 million, representing about    41% of our total research and development spend.    We launched our Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam, creating opportunities    for others to join us in finding solutions to the world's energy    challenges. One such project is a collaboration between Shell and Dow, an    American chemicals company, to electrify steam cracking furnaces with    renewable energy. Steam cracking is one of the most carbon-intensive    processes in petrochemical production. E-cracking furnaces operated using    renewable electricity have the potential to reduce Scope 1 emissions from    steam cracking by up to 90%.    Shell invests in start-ups that develop new technologies and business    models which have the potential to accelerate the energy transition.    Globally, Shell Ventures is one of the most active venture capital    investors in climate technology and mobility. In 2022, Shell Ventures    invested in more than 20 start-ups, including Statiq, a company that is    building a charging network for electric vehicles in India; the Dutch    company enie.nl, which installs solar panels on roofs in the Netherlands    and Africa; and Li-Industries, an American company that has developed a    unique technology to recycle lithium batteries.

Once operational, the plant will produce 100,000 tonnes of bio-LNG each year. In the Netherlands, Shell became the first fuel retailer to offer bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all its customers. Trucks using this blend emit around 30% less CO(2). In the aviation sector, we became the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore in February 2022. By the end of the year we were supplying SAF to airlines at seven airports around the world. We also acquired Malaysian waste oil recycling firm EcoOils, securing long-term access to advanced biofuels feedstock that will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers.

The volatility caused by Russia's war in Ukraine has highlighted the need for a global supply of secure and affordable energy. We continue to supply the conventional fuels needed to help meet this demand, including natural gas and traditional fuels (such as fuel oil, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel), while lowering emissions from our own operations. Natural gas In 2022, as one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we shipped natural gas to where it was needed most. We delivered 194 cargoes of LNG to Europe - almost five times our usual average. In total, we sold 66.0 million tonnes of LNG in 2022 compared with 64.2 million tonnes in 2021. LNG plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower-carbon alternative. For example, combined-cycle gas turbines emit about 50% less CO(2) per unit of electricity generated than an average coal-fired power plant, according to the IEA. LNG also helps to decarbonise shipping operations and commercial road transport. In 2022, we completed more than 250 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations. We provide LNG to ships at 15 ports in 10 countries. We also expanded our LNG refuelling network to more than 60 operated sites, bringing the number of sites where Shell customers can access LNG in Europe to more than 160. Shell was selected as a partner in two projects in Qatar: the expansion of the North Field East, which is the largest LNG project in the world, and the North Field South project [A]. By using carbon capture and storage, these landmark projects will help provide LNG with a lower carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these two projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later in the decade. In 2022, we also took final investment decisions to develop offshore gas projects in Malaysia, the UK and Australia. One of them, the Rosmari-Marjoram project, situated 220 kilometres off the coast of Malaysia, will mainly be powered by renewable energy. Traditional fuels From exploration to refining and distribution, traditional fuels continue to play a key role in the energy system. We estimate that our oil production peaked in 2019. In 2022, our crude oil and natural gas liquids production available for sale was 13% lower than in the previous year. This larger than usual decline was mainly driven by portfolio changes, including the sale of our Permian business in late 2021 and the derecognition of volumes related to Sakhalin in Russia. In 2022, we continued the transformation of our integrated refineries into Energy and Chemicals Parks. This involves developing new facilities and converting or dismantling existing units. We plan to process less crude oil and use more renewable and recycled feedstocks such as hydrogen, biofuels and plastic waste. In the USA, we completed the sale of our Mobile refinery in Alabama and of our interest in the Deer Park refinery in Texas. We have implemented a variety of measures to reduce the energy use and increase the energy efficiency of our operations, with estimated total savings of around 1,155 million kilowatt hours (kWh). Please refer to the \"Our journey to net zero\" section in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for examples of the measures we took in 2022. Our conventional fuels activities are part of our Upstream, Marketing, Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products business segments. [A] Shell participation in the North Field South project remains subject to clearance of remaining customary conditions precedent.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    In Focus    Carbon capture and storage (CCS)    Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock    the potential for CCS to reduce emissions where there are currently few    viable low-carbon alternatives.    In 2022, Shell's spending on CCS opportunities (operating expenses and    cash capital expenditure) amounted to around $220 million, an increase of    51% from the $146 million invested in 2021. Shell's equity share of    captured and stored CO(2) was around 0.4 million tonnes in 2022, in line    with the 2021 amount.    In Norway, our Northern Lights CCS joint venture (Shell interest 33%)    signed a letter of intent on cross-border CO(2 )transport and storage in    August. Under this agreement, some 800,000 tonnes of CO(2) will be    captured, compressed and liquefied at a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant    in the Netherlands from early 2025. The CO(2) will then be transported to    Norway for permanent storage 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North    Sea. In November 2022, construction started on the first two ships that    will be used to transport CO(2) to the Northern Lights facilities.    We are making progress in other CCS projects in our portfolio. In Canada,    for example, the Alberta government selected the Atlas Sequestration Hub    (with Shell as 50% partner) to move to the next stage for further    evaluation in April 2022.    CCS is part of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business segment.

We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon    benefit but also deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities.    We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits    projects we invest in are of a high quality.    In 2022, we invested $69 million in nature-based projects and $23 million    in technology-based projects, such as fuel-efficient cookstoves. The    nature-based projects include reforestation and the prevention of    landscape degradation and destruction. The spend on nature-based projects    includes a $40 million investment in Brazilian carbon credit developer    Carbonext. This company's portfolio protects more than 2 million hectares    of the Amazon rainforest.    We offer carbon credits to drivers and business customers who wish to    compensate for the life-cycle CO(2)-equivalent emissions of the Shell    product they buy. In 2022, this offer was extended to motorists at more    than 4,000 service stations in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary,    the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.    We delivered 11 carbon-compensated liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes to    our customers across the globe, and for the first time, a GHG-neutral LNG    cargo in line with the GIIGNL Framework [A]. We also launched our Avgas    carbon-compensated offer for aviation customers in selected markets in    Europe and in Singapore, through our airport network.    In 2022, we retired 5.8 million carbon credits, including 4.1 million    credits included in our net carbon intensity, and 1.7 million carbon    credits associated mainly with the sale of non-energy products and with    Shell's business travel. One carbon credit represents the avoidance or    removal of 1 tonne of CO(2). We carefully source and screen the credits we    purchase and retire from the market, and work with certification standards    and ratings agencies to check that our requirements are met.    Carbon credits, including nature-based solutions are part of our    Renewables and Energy Solutions business segment.

Energy transition in Action: a selection of 2022 developments (map)    Financial framework    Read about our investments through the energy transition and our targeted    returns.        Investments and returns        Investing in net zero Investments and returns Since the first quarter of 2022, we have reported separately on the performance of our five business segments [A]:   * Our Marketing business has targeted returns of 15-25%. It comprises     Mobility, Lubricants, and Sectors and Decarbonisation. Mobility operates     Shell's retail network, including electric vehicle charging services.     Lubricants produces, markets and sells lubricants for road transport, and     machinery used in manufacturing, mining, power generation, agriculture and     construction. Sectors and Decarbonisation sells fuels, speciality products     and services, including energy solutions that help customers reduce     emissions in the aviation, marine, commercial road transport and     agricultural sectors, among others.   * Our Renewables and Energy Solutions business has targeted returns of more     than 10% [B]. It includes renewable power generation, the marketing and     trading of power and pipeline gas, as well as carbon credits, and digitally     enabled customer solutions. Renewables and Energy Solutions also includes     the production and marketing of hydrogen, development of commercial carbon     capture and storage hubs, investment in nature-based projects that avoid or     reduce carbon emissions (Nature-based solutions), and Shell Ventures, which     invests in companies that work to accelerate the energy and mobility     transformation.   * Our Integrated Gas business has targeted returns of 14-18%. It includes     liquefied natural gas (LNG), conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids     (GTL) fuels and other products. It includes natural gas and liquids     exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream     infrastructure necessary to deliver these to market. Integrated Gas also     includes the marketing, trading and optimisation of LNG, including LNG as a     fuel for heavy-duty vehicles.   * Our Chemicals and Products business has targeted returns of 10-15%. It     includes chemicals manufacturing plants with their own marketing network,     and refineries which turn crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil     products. These are moved and marketed around the world for domestic,     industrial and transport use. The business also includes pipelines, trading     of crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals, and oil sands activities,     which involves the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its     conversion into synthetic oil.   * Our Upstream business has targeted returns of 20-25%. It explores for and     extracts crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and     transports oil and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver     them to the market. Shell's Upstream business delivers reliable energy from     conventional oil and gas operations, as well as deep-water exploration and     production activities. We are focusing our Upstream portfolio to become more     resilient, prioritising value over volume to provide the energy the world     needs today whilst funding the energy system of tomorrow. For all these businesses, our target returns consider the risks and uncertainties associated with our investments, and the scale of spending that is required to develop opportunities. For example, in our Upstream business, they reflect the costs of exploration, feasibility studies and construction, as well as risks linked to commodity prices. In 2022, our cash capital expenditure [C] was around $25 billion and our operating expenses were around $39 billion. The table below shows how much we spent and the cash flow from operations in 2021 and 2022 across our businesses. [A] On January 31, 2023, we announced that our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses will be combined to form a new Integrated Gas and Upstream Directorate. The Downstream business will be combined with Renewables and Energy Solutions to form a new Downstream and Renewables Directorate. These changes are expected to take effect on July 1, 2023 and will not affect Shell's financial reporting segments in 2023.

Read more about our Outlook for 2023 and beyond in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Investing in net zero In 2022, we invested $8.2 billion in low-carbon energy and non-energy products, around a third of our total cash capital expenditure [A] of $25 billion. Of that, we invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, an increase of 89% compared with the previous year. This includes capital spending on biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, as well as wind and solar power [B]. The remaining $3.9 billion was invested in non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our customers. Our investment in non-energy products decreased by 9% compared with 2021. These investments advance a central part of our strategy which is to sell more products with low-carbon emissions to help both Shell and our customers meet their climate targets. Two-thirds of our capital spending in 2022 was on maintaining supplies of the vital energy the world needs today. We invested $4.2 billion in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as well as gas and power marketing and trading, an increase of 17% compared with the previous year. We expect LNG will remain an important part of the energy mix for many years to come because of its role in reducing emissions from power generation and transport. We also increased our investments in oil production and oil products by 30% to $12.5 billion. This includes investments of $8.1 billion in our Upstream business, helping maintain our assets and make up for the natural decline in oil and gas production. It also includes investments in refining and trading, as well as fuels marketing, which are important to maintain supplies of fuels for motorists, commercial road transport, aviation and industry. [A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for the definition of cash capital expenditure.

Policies and governance    Read about our climate-related governance and policy engagement, and our    disclosures linked to climate standards and benchmarks.        Climate policy engagement        Climate governance        A just transition        Climate standards and benchmarks Climate policy engagement National and international climate and energy transition policies play an increasingly important role in steering and enabling the energy transition. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. We advocate directly to governments and policy makers, offering relevant information, views, and policy recommendations on new proposals. For example, Shell supports the European Union's Fit for 55 package, which aims to enable the EU's transition to climate neutrality by 2050. As part of our engagements with the EU institutions in 2022, we called for binding targets in the Renewable Energy Directive to accelerate the use of renewable hydrogen in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and transport by 2030. We engage governments and policymakers indirectly, for example through our participation in coalitions and industry associations. We recognise that industry associations may represent many members and sometimes we may have different views on a topic. We join coalitions where there is likely to be a common advocacy objective. In the USA, for example, Shell supported the US Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in 2022. We advocated different clean energy provisions, such as expanded tax credits for carbon capture utilisation and storage, and the creation of a tax credit for hydrogen production. We engaged with Members of Congress and the Biden Administration directly, as well as through advocacy coalitions, including the CEO Climate Dialogue, the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition and the Carbon Capture Coalition. In India, we continued to engage with the government, industry partners, think tanks and academic institutions to collectively find ways to promote low-carbon energy choices. In 2022, we launched a carbon capture utilisation and storage industry coalition with our partners. It aims to encourage the creation of government policies to support the development of carbon capture and storage projects in India. We also aim to help shape the wider debate around the energy transition in other ways, including through speeches and articles. Ahead of a meeting of the EU Parliament in June 2022, for example, Shell published an opinion piece on the European news website Euractiv. We supported the proposal to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the European Union from 2035, which was agreed a few months later. We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate and energy-transition-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy and advocacy positions, and information about our industry association memberships, on our website. In March 2023, we plan to publish our first Climate and Energy Transition Lobbying Report. This report reviews our lobbying in 2022 and our memberships of industry associations. We continue to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate and energy transition policy positions.

In 2022, the Board continued to consider energy transition matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding the implementation of our Powering Progress strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets - including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. To foster the delivery of our strategy, we have further aligned staff remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees, including Executive Committee members. From 2022, we introduced new metrics to the measure called Shell's Journey in the Energy Transition (15% of the annual bonus scorecard). These are:   * Selling lower carbon products - we help customers to reduce their emissions     by supplying low-carbon products. We measure our success by the earnings     share of our Marketing activities from low-carbon energy products as well as     non-energy products and convenience retail.   * Reducing operational emissions - our target is to achieve a 50% reduction by     2030; and this measure is based on reducing our Scope 1 and 2 operational     emissions.   * Partnering to decarbonise - we seek to collaborate with our customers to     help them reduce their emissions. In 2022, we measured success in this area     in terms of our progress in rolling     out our electric vehicle charging network. We also introduced a customer excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard, to emphasise the importance of building ever stronger customer relationships in the energy transition. Our Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) and Performance share plan (PSP) tie pay for around 16,500 employees directly to achieving our strategic ambitions for the energy transition. From 2019 onwards, we have included an energy transition performance metric in our LTIP. This element vested for the second time in 2022, at 180% of target, based on performance between 2020 and the end of 2022, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future. The weight of this metric will be increased from 20% to 25% for the most senior employees for the upcoming LTIP cycle (2023-2025).

A just transition Shell supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, which recognises the importance of a just transition. A just transition means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Our aim is to contribute to a just transition by making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, our customers and our workforce. This is part of our strategic goal to power lives. In 2022, we pledged \\xA3100 million to help communities in the UK develop skills and find jobs linked to the energy transition. This includes establishing educational skill centres, part of a wider aim to help 15,000 people find employment by 2030. Shell continues to work with governments and our partners, such as Energy for a Just Transition, facilitated by Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), and Ipieca's Just Transition Taskforce. We are committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We continue to help our own staff learn new skills needed for the energy transition. In 2022, around 4,000 Shell employees - up from 1,700 in 2021 - completed courses on a range of subjects, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. You can read more about our approach at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/justtransition\">www.shell.com/justtransition</url> Climate standards and benchmarks Climate standards and benchmarks play a key role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Shell welcomes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities.

In its assessment, TPI highlights that it has recalculated Shell's net carbon intensity according to its own methodology. It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology. We are pleased to see that our ratings have improved in two areas in the latest assessment, but we continue to be disappointed with certain key aspects of the assessment due to differences in the methodologies used. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their Benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment.       Litigation and activism       Read about our position on climate litigation and activism.               Climate litigation and activism Climate litigation and activism During the past decade, environmental activists have increasingly used litigation to hold governments and companies accountable for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. Shell is involved in more than 20 such court cases worldwide. In March 2022, we appealed a ruling by the District Court of The Hague in the Netherlands from May 2021, which requires Shell to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most ambitious energy scenarios published for the sectors in which we operate. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, we are taking active steps to comply with the ruling. We believe the actions we are taking to deliver our energy transition strategy are consistent with the court ruling and its end of 2030 timeline. This includes the investments we are making in low- carbon fuels, renewable power, and hydrogen; in addition to making changes to our upstream and refinery portfolios. In February 2023, environmental law group ClientEarth filed a claim with the High Court in England against Shell plc and the current Board of Directors challenging the board's decision-making regarding Shell's climate strategy. This is a derivative action brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company. The High Court must grant permission for ClientEarth to proceed with the claim. Investors representing less than 0.2% of Shell's total shareholder base have sent letters supporting the claim. We do not accept ClientEarth's allegations. We believe our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the Company. We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system. We believe it is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and to put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy. Litigation does not enable the global cooperation required to change both supply and demand for energy, as well as the infrastructure supporting the use of energy. Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5(o)C above pre-industrial levels. Importantly, we have already delivered results: Shell reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control in 2022 by 30% compared with 2016. Some shareholders, such as Follow This, have also called on us to set even more ambitious targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions. This is also a focus of some of the climate litigation against us. Shell would, among other things, have to decrease its sales of oil products and gas to reduce its Scope 3 emissions in line with the Follow This resolution. Doing so, without changing demand and the way our customers use energy, would effectively mean handing over customers to competitors. This would materially affect Shell's financial strength and limits its ability to generate value for shareholders. It would also reduce our ability to play an important role in the energy transition by working with customers to reduce their emissions. We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy, which we believe is the best for society, our customers and our shareholders.

In this Report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this Report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\" are collectively referred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Forward-looking statements This Report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 (available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/investor\">www.shell.com/investor</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this Report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report, March 16, 2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward- looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between this Report and Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, such discrepancy or inconsistency is unintended, and the information included in Shell's Form 20-F controls. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this Report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which include Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This Report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of\\ which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this Report do not form part of this Report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this Report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\"is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2 )compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2) equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e (CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

Bangladesh has made remarkable progress towards becoming climate resilient. More will be needed since global heating is getting worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Due to its geographic location and high population density, the entire country is a climate hotspot. Common issues include heat waves, erratic rainfall, flooding, droughts, cyclones, river bank erosion and ground water becoming saline due to the rising sea level. People who live close to river banks or the Indian Ocean Coast are especially at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The nation must cope with both slow- and rapid-onset crises. Climate change is affecting water availability, food security, nutrition, health and livelihoods in general. Loss of land or a failed harvest often push people below the poverty line. The results are displacement and social crisis.</p><p>Impressive progress</p><p>The good news is that impressive progress is being made. The death count of major cyclones has gone down spectacularly. In 2020, Amphan claimed 26 lives. In 1991, Gorky was of similar magnitude, but killed almost 140,000 people. Another two decades earlier, the death toll of Bhola was even worse: more than 500,000 dead.</p><p>These numbers show that the action taken by both government agencies and civil-society organisations has been successful. Today, Bangladesh has an effective early-warning system. Among other things, it relies on cell-broadcasting. Before an imminent catastrophe, text messages are sent to every mobile phone in the area concerned. Volunteers have been trained to manage evacuation efforts, with an eye to supporting needy people in particular. The coastal areas have an extensive network of cyclone shelters, and many of them serve other purposes too. Some, for example, are primary schools in ordinary times, for instance.</p><p>Preparing for disasters obviously includes teaching school children what to do when a cyclone strikes. It has become part of the national curriculum. When the need arises, the shelters can accommodate entire village populations. Indeed, most people flee there when disaster strikes, though some of those who do not, still perish.</p><p>Civil-society organisations matter very much</p><p>The role of non-governmental organisations cannot be over-emphasised. Bangladesh has a vast network of them, and many are involved in raising awareness of climate change and its impacts, disseminating knowledge among local communities and building capacities to tackle socio-economic hazards.</p><p>In this brief essay, the example of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society must suffice. After the deadly devastation of Bhola in 1970 and the war of independence in 1971, it established its Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) in 1972. Today, it has 70,000 volunteers who, in a unique institutional arrangement, serve communities at the grassroots level.</p><p>Cyclones, of course, do not only harm human bodies. They cause economic devastation which is harder to limit. Homes are destroyed, livestock killed and fields made useless. It adds to the problems that many families who depend on small farms or fishing are too poor to afford private insurance. The assets they lose - a boat, a cow or artisanal tools, for instance - may not be worth a lot of money, but to the people concerned, they are most precious. Their livelihoods depend on them.</p><p>For people to bounce back after a disaster, several things are helpful, they include reliable social safety nets and infrastructure that is strong enough to survive extreme weather. Economic opportunities matter too. In all areas, nature-based solutions are best because they are not only comparatively inexpensive, but also enhance, rather than deplete the resilience of the local eco-system. The rehabilitation of mangrove forest along the coast, moreover, has reduced the impact a cyclone has after landfall, with the trees serving as a first barrier. Moreover, locally-led interventions are to be preferred, because they tend to be both efficient and effective (regarding nature-based and locally-led solutions, also see David Mfitumukiza on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>In recent decades, Bangladesh has adopted several policies, plans and strategies for coping with climate change. Important ones include:</p><p>the National Adaptation Programme of Action of 2005 (NAPA), which was updated in 2009,</p><p>the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) of 2009,</p><p>the Standing Orders on Disasters (SOD) of 2010, which were updated in 2019,</p><p>the Climate Change and Gender Action Plan (ccGAP) of 2013,</p><p>the National Disaster Management Policy of 2015,</p><p>the National Disaster Management Plan for the years 2021 to 2025,</p><p>the Eighth Five Year Plan 2020-2025,</p><p>the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 of 2018,</p><p>the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) of 2021.</p><p>In the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, moreover, the Government of Bangladesh has prepared a national adaptation plan and spelled out the nationally determined contributions to multilateral climate action.</p><p>Comprehensive vision</p><p>The focus of policymaking has been expanded from initially identifying and tackling problems of an immediate nature to increasingly holistic approaches that boost the resilience of individual people, local communities and ultimately society as a whole. The vision is to eradicate poverty and achieve economic and social well-being. The Government of Bangladesh's idea of climate resilience is both pro-poor and gender-sensitive. It keeps updating its policies in the light of new evidence and insights.</p><p>So far, two national ministries play lead roles. They are the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. Other ministries, however, are expected to design their own programmes in accordance with the overarching policies. Subnational government institutions matter too, of course, including district administrations and municipal authorities. All ministries are expected to prepare their own detailed work plan in accordance with the SOD guidelines. Moreover, there are Disaster Management Committees (DMC) at all subnational levels.</p><p>In terms of implementation, Bangladesh has been relying on its own financial resources to a large extent. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) was established in 2010. The national government uses it to distribute funding. So far, the \u00adBCCTF has disbursed the equivalent of about $ 450 million.</p><p>Most of the related projects have focused on things like water infrastructure, food security and disaster risk reduction. Apart from multi-purpose shelters, other kinds of built infrastructure are helpful, including for example drainage and irrigation channels. River regulation and hydraulic systems matter too, and strong embankments protect people and fields from flooding. In a more general sense, agricultural adaptation, afforestation and reforestation help to reduce disasters risks too.</p><p>International funding</p><p>The country has also received financial resources from abroad in past decades. Official development assistance (ODA) and various forms of climate finance has helped Bangladesh to gradually turn vulnerability into resilience. It is disappointing, however, that high-income countries have not been living up to all climate-finance commitments (see Saleemul Huq on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Although Bangladesh has come a long way in achieving resilience, there is still room for improvement. According to the most recent assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>), one of the problems Bangladesh will most likely face is even more frequent and more intense cyclones in the future.</p><p>The IPCC has also mentioned maladaptation to environmental change as a serious challenge. In Bangladesh, shrimp cultivation is an example. Converting agricultural land to aquaculture ponds brought short-term benefits, but the long-term impacts have proven to outweigh them. The business is now seen to be unsustainable. Future development plans must be better geared to eco-friendly, but broad based prosperity.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["For people to bounce back after a disaster, several things are helpful, they include reliable social safety nets and infrastructure that is strong enough to survive extreme weather.

The partners signed the world's first long-term purchase agreement for direct air capture and storage of carbon dioxide, worth USD 10 million over ten years. For Swiss Re, the collaboration marks a milestone towards its goal of reaching net-zero emissions in its own operations by 2030. The partnership is also a sign of Swiss Re's support for the carbon removal industry and gives the Group early access to the new carbon removal risk pools and asset classes. Both the length of the term of ten years and the total value of USD\u00a010\u00a0million are so far unmatched in the voluntary market for this type of high-quality carbon removal, sending an important demand signal to developers, investors and other buyers. The companies also agreed to collaborate on developing risk management knowledge and risk transfer solutions, as well as to explore future investment and project finance opportunities. 'To mitigate the risks of climate change, the world needs to scale-up carbon removal on top of, not instead of emission reductions. By partnering with Climeworks we can play to our strengths in this endeavour, as a risk taker, investor, and forward-looking buyer of climate solutions', said Christian Mumenthaler, Swiss Re's Group Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.  The technological carbon removal solution offered by Climeworks in Iceland filters carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air using geothermal energy. The captured CO2 is then sent for permanent storage in nearby rock layers. It is dissolved in water and pumped deep underground, where it reacts naturally with the surrounding basalt rock to form stable carbonate minerals - the CO2 literally turns into stone. This is considered the safest, most durable form of all carbon removal solutions that are commercially available today.  At a price point of several hundred dollars per tonne of CO2 removed, it is at present also one of the costliest options. Larger, more economical air-capture and storage facilities can only be realised if customers are committed to long-term purchasing agreements. They guarantee a future revenue stream to the developers, making new projects fundable. Christoph Gebald, co-CEO and co-founder of Climeworks, said: 'We are very proud to have established the basis for a unique long-term partnership with the leading risk knowledge company Swiss Re. This is a decisive milestone for the scale-up of Climeworks and the direct air capture industry.' Carbon removal projects can use nature-based solutions like afforestation, which comes with many co-benefits, such as improved biodiversity. They are, however, limited by other types of land use and are vulnerable to the re-release of the stored carbon, eg through wildfires. This is why technological carbon removal solutions like direct air capture and storage are necessary to limit global warming over the long run.  Bringing climate solutions to scale not only requires the right demand signals, but also de-risking and financing. The insurance sector is uniquely positioned to offer support on all three fronts: through long-term purchase agreements, providing insurance capacity for evolving risk pools, and investments in new asset classes, as described in the recent Swiss Re Institute report on the insurance rationale for carbon removal solutions.  Swiss Re has committed to achieve net-zero emissions in its insurance and investment business by 2050, and in its own operations already by 2030, following its 'Do our best, remove the rest' approach that aims to first of all reduce emissions as much as possible before balancing any residual emissions through carbon removal. Swiss ReThe Swiss Re Group is one of the world's leading providers of reinsurance, insurance and other forms of insurance-based risk transfer, working to make the world more resilient. It anticipates and manages risk - from natural catastrophes to climate change, from ageing populations to cyber crime. The aim of the Swiss Re Group is to enable society to thrive and progress, creating new opportunities and solutions for its clients. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, where it was founded in 1863, the Swiss Re Group operates through a network of around 80 offices globally. ClimeworksClimeworks empowers people to reverse climate change by permanently removing carbon dioxide from the air. One of two things happens to the Climeworks air-captured carbon dioxide: either it is returned to earth, stored safely and permanently away for millions of years, or it is upcycled into climate-friendly products such as carbon-neutral fuels and materials. The Climeworks direct air capture technology runs exclusively on clean energy, and the modular CO2 collectors can be stacked to build machines of any size. Founded by engineers Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher, Climeworks strives to inspire 1 billion people to act now and remove carbon dioxide from the air. Together we can build a climate-positive world.

Since 1996 the global area covered by mangrove forests about 146000 square kilometres has decreased by about 6.6 per cent according to the report. This is largely due to mangrove forests - which are found in almost all warm coastal regions - being converted into farmland or ponds for aquaculture.</p><p>The situation in Kenya is especially worrisome as 18 per cent of the mangrove forests were lost in just a quarter-century between 1985 and 2010 finds the report. At issue is the fact that people here see mangrove as a source of wood explains James Kairo a lead researcher at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI).</p><p>Residents in Gazi and other coastal areas in Kenya will fell the mangrove trees and use them as building material or for burning. </p><p>But beyond storing carbon dioxide mangroves also have many other advantages bringing tangible benefits to the residents in Gazi.</p><p>They protect against coastal erosion as well as possible future effects of climate change such as rising sea levels. Mangroves also help provide better water quality and are home to many different types of marine life. \"We know that when you interfere with the mangroves you also interfere with the fish\" according to Kairo.</p><p>Mikoko Pamoja wants to do something about it.

The project is financed by carbon credits bought by firms and people.</p><p>The project also attempts to get the community involved with the goal of helping residents understand the advantages of mangroves.</p><p>Some of the proceeds are used to support hospitals improve water supplies and promote educational projects.

Its advice makes sense.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Energy demand and carbon emissions plummeted this year due to the economic halt. Recovery offers a window of opportunity to 'build back better' - the unofficial motto of sustainable disaster recovery. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, has appealed to member countries to make 2019 the peak year in energy-related carbon emissions by using recovery funding to advance clean energy. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary General, has endorsed that message, pointing out that 'clean energy puts countries on safer and healthier footing'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the example of the USA in the 1930s showed, government spending can lead an economy out of a depression, even if that spending is based on significant public debt. Investments in infrastructure are particularly useful because they not only create short-term employment, but also lay the foundation for long-term prosperity.</p><p>Today, the smart thing is to invest in climate protection and adaptation. Rele\u00advant projects include retrofitting housing stock for renewable energy, building bicycle-transport networks or implementing nature-based solutions for flood protection. Stimulus money can be used to build smart power grids or to convert industrial facilities in ways that allow them to use clean energy. Experts warn policymakers not to repeat the mistakes made after the global financial crisis of 2008, when short-sighted bailouts benefited fossil-fuel intensive industries and exacerbated the global problem of climate change. Instead, governments should have focused on the jobs and industries of the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, several countries are already showing signs of repeat failure. The Guardian reported in early July, for example, that the USA had given loans worth at least $?3 billion to some 5,600 fossil-fuel companies, including coal-based power plants and oil drillers. US President Donald Trump denies the science of climate change, and his administration serves the special interests of ecologically destructive industries. Trump pretends that environmental protection hurts economic growth, but shows no interest in long-term sustainability. His science denial and focus on short-term business data, moreover, have led to fast opening up after lockdown, allowing Covid-19 infection numbers to rise dreadfully in the USA in July. The worsening pandemic may thus well erase the economic advantages of opening up too fast.</p><p>The US administration's destructive stance became evident once more during a virtual global conference that the IEA held in early July. On the upside, energy ministers from 40 of the most energy-consuming countries took part, indicating their interest in accelerating the transition to renewable energy in the context of the Covid-19 recovery.</p><p>The EU, for example, recently released its pound ?1.85 trillion, seven-year recovery plan, which will invest in green industries and technologies. China and India also made promising announcements. Multilateral institutions, including the IEA, would do well to keep pressure on governments to live up to such pledges. In regard to climate protection, the EU, China and India so far have tended to be behind schedule, rather than pressing ahead fast with urgently needed action (for the example of India, see Aditi Roy Ghatak in Focus section of D+C/E+Z \u00ade-Paper 2020/04).</p><p>Low-income countries, by contrast, typically lack the fiscal space to adopt stimulus programmes of their own. The international community should support their indispensable climate action.</p><p>In any case, the IEA deserves praise for promoting the clean energy agenda. A decade ago, it still had a reputation for promoting fossil fuels and underplaying the potential of renewable energy. Its change of tune is welcome. Pressure from major institutional investors, including pension funds and insurance companies, helped to make it happen. They know that business needs sustainability.

The partners signed the world's first long-term purchase agreement for direct air capture and storage of carbon dioxide, worth USD 10 million over ten years. For Swiss Re, the collaboration marks a milestone towards its goal of reaching net-zero emissions in its own operations by 2030. The partnership is also a sign of Swiss Re's support for the carbon removal industry and gives the Group early access to the new carbon removal risk pools and asset classes.  Both the length of the term of ten years and the total value of USD 10 million are so far unmatched in the voluntary market for this type of high-quality carbon removal, sending an important demand signal to developers, investors and other buyers. The companies also agreed to collaborate on developing risk management knowledge and risk transfer solutions, as well as to explore future investment and project finance opportunities.  'To mitigate the risks of climate change, the world needs to scale-up carbon removal on top of, not instead of emission reductions. By partnering with Climeworks we can play to our strengths in this endeavour, as a risk taker, investor, and forward-looking buyer of climate solutions', said Christian Mumenthaler, Swiss Re's Group Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.  The technological carbon removal solution offered by Climeworks in Iceland filters carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air using geothermal energy. The captured CO2 is then sent for permanent storage in nearby rock layers. It is dissolved in water and pumped deep underground, where it reacts naturally with the surrounding basalt rock to form stable carbonate minerals - the CO2 literally turns into stone. This is considered the safest, most durable form of all carbon removal solutions that are commercially available today.  At a price point of several hundred dollars per tonne of CO2 removed, it is at present also one of the costliest options. Larger, more economical air-capture and storage facilities can only be realised if customers are committed to long-term purchasing agreements. They guarantee a future revenue stream to the developers, making new projects fundable.  Christoph Gebald, co-CEO and co-founder of Climeworks, said: 'We are very proud to have established the basis for a unique long-term partnership with the leading risk knowledge company Swiss Re. This is a decisive milestone for the scale-up of Climeworks and the direct air capture industry.'  Carbon removal projects can use nature-based solutions like afforestation, which comes with many co-benefits, such as improved biodiversity. They are, however, limited by other types of land use and are vulnerable to the re-release of the stored carbon, eg through wildfires. This is why technological carbon removal solutions like direct air capture and storage are necessary to limit global warming over the long run.  Bringing climate solutions to scale not only requires the right demand signals, but also de-risking and financing. The insurance sector is uniquely positioned to offer support on all three fronts: through long-term purchase agreements, providing insurance capacity for evolving risk pools, and investments in new asset classes, as described in the recent Swiss Re Institute report on the insurance rationale for carbon removal solutions.  Swiss Re has committed to achieve net-zero emissions in its insurance and investment business by 2050, and in its own operations already by 2030, following its 'Do our best, remove the rest' approach that aims to first of all reduce emissions as much as possible before balancing any residual emissions through carbon removal.  Swiss Re The Swiss Re Group is one of the world's leading providers of reinsurance, insurance and other forms of insurance-based risk transfer, working to make the world more resilient. It anticipates and manages risk - from natural catastrophes to climate change, from ageing populations to cyber crime. The aim of the Swiss Re Group is to enable society to thrive and progress, creating new opportunities and solutions for its clients. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, where it was founded in 1863, the Swiss Re Group operates through a network of around 80 offices globally.  Climeworks Climeworks empowers people to reverse climate change by permanently removing carbon dioxide from the air. One of two things happens to the Climeworks air-captured carbon dioxide: either it is returned to earth, stored safely and permanently away for millions of years, or it is upcycled into climate-friendly products such as carbon-neutral fuels and materials. The Climeworks direct air capture technology runs exclusively on clean energy, and the modular CO2 collectors can be stacked to build machines of any size. Founded by engineers Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher, Climeworks strives to inspire 1 billion people to act now and remove carbon dioxide from the air. Together we can build a climate-positive world. Join us!

An additional 17-20 Gt of CO2 reductions and a 40% reduction in methane emissions would be needed to achieve that objective. But the ETC's report Keeping 1.5\u00b0C Alive: Closing the Gap in the 2020s , describes technologically feasible actions which could close that gap to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and which could be catalyzed by agreements at the upcoming COP26 climate summit in November in Glasgow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of the actions entail minimal cost and would spur further innovation and support green economic development; and all of them could be given impetus at COP26 via commitments from leading countries and companies, without the need for comprehensive international agreement. But two high priority actions - ending deforestation and reducing emissions from existing coal plants - will need to be supported by climate finance flows from rich developed countries.</p><p>The recommendations cover six areas: cutting methane emissions, ending deforestation and other nature-based solutions, moving faster beyond coal, accelerating road transport electrification, decarbonising key industrial and other \"harder to abate\" sectors, and achieving improvements in energy efficiency.</p><p>\"To keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees alive, the world must act now to halve emissions over the next decade, and work towards net zero by the middle of the century,\" said COP26 President-Designate, Alok Sharma. \"This report sets out a clear and credible action plan of achievable emissions to get us on a 1.5 degree pathway. Ahead of COP26, we urge all countries to submit enhanced plans to reduce emissions and take action on coal, cars, trees and methane.\"</p><p>\"Current national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are a useful step forward but far from sufficient to limit global warming to an acceptable level,\" commented Adair Turner, Chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. \"But we have the technologies to achieve far faster reductions, often at nil or low cost, and this report shows how. And much of what needs to be done does not require comprehensive international agreements, but can be driven forward by coalitions of leading countries and companies. COP26 must be the catalyst to seizing this opportunity.\"</p><p>Nigel Topping, UK High Level Climate Action Champion, COP26, said: \"The ETC highlights the critical actions for nations and companies to Keep 1.5\u00b0C. Alive. Rallying leadership and global support is at the heart of the Race to Zero and the ETC's recommendations demonstrate that it is technically and economically feasible to achieve collective action in the next decade. Momentum is building and it is now crucial that we focus on rapid deployment in the 2020s, if we are to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\"</p><p>The six categories of action identified by the ETC are:</p><p>1. Significant and rapid reductions in methane emissions. The latest report from    the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that methane    emissions have accounted for around 40% of past global warming, and reducing    these emissions is the most powerful lever available to limit global warming    as soon as possible. But many NDCs place insufficient focus on methane.    Low-cost actions could cut fossil fuel related emissions by 60% by 2030,    while emissions arising from agriculture and waste management could    potentially be cut by 30%. 2. Halting deforestation and beginning reforestation. Halting deforestation,    beginning reforestation and improving other land use practices could reduce    emissions by 6.5Gt per year by 2030. Achieving this will require financial    support from rich developed countries and should be a priority use of    committed climate finance. 3. Decarbonising the power sector and accelerating the phaseout of coal.    Coal-fired electricity generation is the single biggest source of greenhouse    gas emissions, but it is increasingly uneconomic against renewables. An    immediate ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants, combined    with a phaseout of existing coal plants could deliver 3.5 Gt of additional    emissions reductions per year by 2030. All rich developed countries should    commit to total phase out by2030, and climate finance flows from developed    economies should support a gradual phase out in developing countries. 4. Accelerating the electrification of road transport. The shift to electric    vehicles (EVs) promises to save consumers money in fuel costs and maintenance    while eliminating one of the largest sources of air pollution. A ban on    selling internal combustion engine light duty vehicles, instituted by 2035,    would cement this shift. Commitments by major fleet operators to fully    electrify their vehicle fleets at still earlier dates would be a powerful    driver of change. An additional 2.3 Gt per year of emission reductions could    result from such actions by 2030. 5. Accelerating supply decarbonisation in buildings, heavy industry, and heavy    transport. Eliminating emissions from these sectors will extend beyond 2030.    But progress in technology and cost reduction is making possible faster    reductions than most NDCs currently assume. Commitments by leading companies    and countries in steel, cement, shipping and aviation could deliver an    additional 1 Gt per year of emissions reductions, with a further 1 GT per    year potentially delivered through accelerated electrification of electric    heat. 6. Reinvigorating energy and resource efficiency. Despite big opportunities to    achieve low-cost emissions reduction via improvements in energy and resource    efficiency, recent progress has been disappointingly slow . But progress    could be accelerated via action at COP26, building on existing initiatives to    spur efficiency improvements in buildings and appliances.</p><p>Sumant Sinha, Chairman and Managing Director, ReNew Power, said: \"Country NDCs fall well short of what is needed to limit global temperature rise by 1.5\u00b0C. More ambitious goals with targeted actions in the energy sector, with specific actions across electricity, transport, industries and buildings are needed. These must be backed by speedy deployment of zero-carbon power, proven emission reduction technologies, creation of the right policy environment to ensure technology diffusion in all sectors. The steps we take now will determine the kind of planet we leave as our legacy.\"</p><p>Note to Editors This report constitutes a collective view of the Energy Transitions Commission.

According to this view, biodiversity is a valuable asset, and its disappearance poses a threat to prosperity. Every interaction with nature should be guided by the idea of true sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dasgupta Review, which was published in February, views nature as an asset comparable to produced capital (like roads, buildings and factories) and human capital (health, knowledge and skills). At the same time, it recognises that nature is more than a commodity: it has an intrinsic value that rests in its very existence.</p><p>Biodiversity, or the variety of habitats and life forms as well as the genetic diversity within species, makes nature productive, resilient and adaptable. The authors of the review, which is named for its lead author, the British economist Partha Dasgupta, see in it another parallel to the financial world: diversity in an investment portfolio reduces risk in the same way that diversity in nature protects ecosystems from shocks. Less biodiversity is bad for both people and nature, the review concludes.</p><p>According to this economic perspective, humanity as a whole has thus far done a poor job managing the global portfolio of natural assets: Dasgupta et al. argue that demand has far outstripped supply. Whereas between 1992 and 2014, produced capital per capita doubled and human capital grew by 13?%, natural capital shrunk by 40?%. In other words: human prosperity has grown at the expense of nature. In order to maintain it, we would need an estimated 1.6 earths.</p><p>But since we only have one planet, economic growth and development must be carried out sustainably. According to Dasgupta, 'truly sustainable economic growth and development means recognising that our long-term prosperity relies on rebalancing our demand of nature's goods and services with its capacity to supply them'. He made this statement at the publication of the review, which he and other experts have been working on since 2019 at the behest of the British government.</p><p>Poor countries are worst affected</p><p>The loss of biodiversity is dramatic (see Theresa Krinninger in D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2019/07, Monitor section). Many ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to coral reefs, have already been irrevocably destroyed; others are about to reach a 'tipping point', which could have dramatic consequences for life on earth. Poor countries, whose economies rely more on domestic natural services and resources than those of industrialised nations, are worst affected, the review emphasises.</p><p>According to the authors, the desperate situation can primarily be attributed to a failure of markets and institutions. They criticise the fact that nature's services and resources cost nothing in financial terms. As a result, there is no incentive to invest in them. They also see it as problematic that many of nature's assets are mobile (animals), silent (trees) or invisible (like the life in the soil). Additionally, they stress that it is difficult to track what factors impact it and how, which leads to numerous external effects.</p><p>According to the review, a fundamental institutional failure is at the root of this market failure. The handling of externalities has been faulty, the authors believe, and almost everywhere in the world, states are exacerbating the problem by spending more on exploiting nature than on preserving it, and by not prioritising sustainable economic activities. Conservative estimates put global subsidies that harm the natural world at $?4 trillion to $?6 trillion per year.</p><p>What's more, there are no international agreements to protect global public goods like oceans or rain forests. The \u00adauthors believe that could be changed at the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in October in Kunming, China, and at the 26th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in November in Glasgow, Scotland. The year 2021 is considered decisive for determining whether dramatic trends like the loss of biodiversity and the fuelling of the climate crisis can be stopped.</p><p>Viewing humans as part of nature</p><p>The authors believe that it is necessary to completely rethink the relationship between nature and economics. Most models of economic growth and development treat nature as the source of a limited number of goods and services, and aim to show that technological advancements could, in principle, overcome these limitations. These theoretical models see humanity as existing 'outside' of nature.</p><p>In contrast, Dasgupta et al. propose an 'economics of biodiversity'. They view humans and their economic systems as part of nature. According to this understanding, humanity must take full responsibility for the consequences of every interaction with nature, from the extraction of commodities to the disposal of waste, and arrive at truly sustainable economic growth and development. Specifically, the authors recognise that action is needed on three levels:</p><p>Humanity must ensure that it does not consume more natural resources than can be provided over the long term. Additionally, the supply of natural assets must be increased, for instance by expanding protected areas, increasing investments in nature-based solutions and enacting policy measures to curb overconsumption and overproduction.</p><p>We should measure economic success differently and arrive at an inclusive definition of prosperity that takes into account the value of investments in nature. Including natural capital in national accounts would be an important step.</p><p>In order to implement these changes, we have to reconfigure our institutions and systems, particularly in the areas of finance and education. For instance, public and private funds could be diverted to increase, rather than decrease, natural assets. Education should place a high value on nature, because, among other reasons, that would allow people to make conscious choices and call for change.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["According to this understanding, humanity must take full responsibility for the consequences of every interaction with nature, from the extraction of commodities to the disposal of waste, and arrive at truly sustainable economic growth and development.

(\"Nouveau Monde\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: NOU; OTCQX: NMGRD; Frankfurt: NM9) to become carbon-neutral. Nouveau Monde's mission is to \"produce the greenest advanced graphite materials with a carbon-neutral footprint for a sustainable world\" and the Company is continuously striving for excellence in minimizing Greenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") emissions and climate impact. A key piece of this GHG-mitigating ambition is the development of 100% renewable electric mining operations on its Matawinie Mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints. When operational, this will result in 82% less direct GHG emissions from mining. To accelerate its deployment, Nouveau Monde is collaborating to develop electric systems and infrastructure for heavy vehicles to be used in open-pit mining. Moreover, the use of hydroelectricity as the exclusive energy source significantly reduces the future carbon footprint of Nouveau Monde's battery material.  In short, through our actions today, we are executing our Mission and driving the transition to a green future.  Arne H Frandsen, Chairman of Nouveau Monde, stated: \"Nouveau Monde has committed to a Zero Harm approach to producing advanced battery materials for decades to come. Carbon neutrality is an important part of this commitment. We know that for many of our potential global clients, being able to purchase North American produced, high-quality carbon-neutral battery anode material, is of great importance. Nouveau Monde is determined to establish itself as one of the world's largest and most important sources of anode material for Lithium-Ion batteries. Nouveau Monde intends to become the Western World's first vertically-integrated, carbon-neutral anode materials producer of scale, coming to market during 2023 with our Matawinie graphite products.\"  Eric Desaulniers, President and CEO of Nouveau Monde, continued: \"With approvals and the ministerial decree now in hand, it is time to deploy resources to put our vision of producing the cleanest and greenest graphite-based products possible, into concrete, measurable actions. Our Phase 1 anode materials plant at B\\xE9cancour is being build and work on our Matawinie Mine is ongoing. While building the carbon-neutral mining and battery anode material producer of the future, based in Qu\\xE9bec, Canada, we are protecting our ecosystem and creating a legacy that will positively impact our communities, or clients, and the world at large.\"  To meet its carbon-neutral objectives, Nouveau Monde has entered into partnership with NEL-i, a Qu\\xE9bec-based firm with expertise in climate action and GHG management solutions, to focus on three main initiatives, which represent the cornerstones of Nouveau Monde's Climate Action Plan (\"CAP\") and carbon-neutrality targets. These initiatives are outlined below and represent the path by which Nouveau Monde is now embarking to secure past, present and future \"carbon-neutral status\".  1. Carbon-neutrality of historical activities  Nouveau Monde takes responsibility for its entire organisational GHG footprint  from its time of inception in 2012  and will promptly act to neutralize its climate impact. From prospecting activities to operating the demonstration concentrator plant, the Company has calculated and reported GHG emissions from all direct emission sources (scope 1), indirect emissions from energy usage (scope 2) and indirect emissions (scope 3) for which the Company was responsible in the pre-commercial phase.  Cumulative historical GHG emissions since the founding of the Company and up to December 31, 2020 are 2,151 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (\"t CO2 e\") (excluding changes in forest carbon stocks - the emissions from this important activity will be quantified and the offsetting will be included in the next phases set out below).  To do this, all historical emissions will be offset by verified emission reductions (\"VER\"), commonly referred to as \"carbon credits\", from certified Qu\\xE9bec projects that comply with best offset practices.  The supported projects are registered projects on the CSA Clean Projects Registry. They meet additionality and best practices criteria as per ISO 14064-2 standards and are third-party verified as per ISO 14064-3. Supported by the experts at NEL-i, Nouveau Monde has assembled a diversified portfolio of GHG offset units from various GHG-reducing activities including:  - landfill gas capture and combustion with energy recovery;  - production of renewable energy from residual forest biomass;  - change in fuel selection, from fossils to bioenergy; and  - energy conservation.  Organizations that have developed these projects and benefited from this initiative include school boards of the Montr\\xE9al metropolitan area, Qu\\xE9bec greenhouse growers and renewable energy producers.  Nouveau Monde expects that its carbon-neutral status will be official during April 2021 once the carbon credits are officially registered in the CSA Clean Projects Registry.  2. Development of the Nouveau Monde's Climate Action Plan and offsetting projects  The Climate Action Plan (\"CAP\"), is a stakeholder engagement tool par excellence, for both internal and external use by organizations whose business strategy is linked to the potentiality of climate impacts. It allows the disclosure of reduction efforts, objectives and results of various initiatives, in addition to serving as a reference and guide for decision-making regarding the carbon footprint of the Company and its products.  The unique nature of Nouveau Monde's operations - underpinned by Qu\\xE9bec's renewable hydroelectricity - positions the Company to have a significantly lower carbon footprint versus other operations globally. For the GHG emissions that Nouveau Monde will emit, the Company is embarking on a comprehensive CAP, in line with its Vision and Mission.  As part of its CAP, Nouveau Monde is completing a monitoring plan comprised of the effective ongoing recording of GHG-related data and will be the basis for accurate GHG quantification and reporting. The organisational GHG inventory is structured to incorporate emissions at the mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints and at the value-added LiB Anode Materials Plant in B\\xE9cancour. All sources of direct emissions (scope 1) and indirect emissions (scope 3) occurring on-site during the site-preparation and construction phase, the operation and the decommissioning, as well as the indirect emissions from energy usage (scope 2) are incorporated into the Company's assessment. The fraction of forest carbon that is transferred to the atmosphere from necessary tree removal is also accounted for, reported separately, and will also be compensated.  All of these emissions will be accounted for, transparently reported and subject to offsetting on a yearly basis. Due to the Company's low GHG emissions  less than 25,000 t CO2 e/year is expected  Nouveau Monde's projects are not subject to the Cap and Trade regulation between Qu\\xE9bec and California.  Nature-based carbon sequestration projects will be identified by Nouveau Monde, with the help of NEL-i to define them and identify their scope of applicability, analyze their profitability (carbon impact), and then develop them. Nouveau Monde is also planning to invest in the research and development of effective carbon mineral storage solutions, through a \"circular economy\" approach - that is, the recycling of industrial mineral residues that are prone to carbonate and that could be used on-site for the management of tailings.  Nouveau Monde will be the developer of these projects and thereby take leadership and ultimate responsibility; as its partner, NEL-i will ensure project conformity to recognized compensation mechanisms (and carbon markets).  3. Partnership in Qu\\xE9bec-wide conservation project and restoration of affected land  Nouveau Monde is committed to playing an active role in the development of innovative initiatives to reduce or remove GHG from the atmosphere and counterbalance a part of its own GHG emissions. The Company is actively working on the creation of nature reserves and the development of land-based carbon sequestration projects. In doing so, Nouveau Monde reinforces a statement of trust in nature-based solutions to effectively achieve net-zero GHG emissions and recognizes the inherent value of our environment and all the social, cultural, economic and environmental co-benefits of healthy ecosystems for our communities.  NEL-i is developing the first large-scale forest carbon stock enhancement project in Qu\\xE9bec. This project incorporates initiatives for conservation, improvement of harvesting and reforestation practices across Qu\\xE9bec. It involves small and large forest landowners in addition to regional conservation organizations that seek to maintain and enhance ecosystems by monetizing their potential for increased sequestration.  As part of this project, a reinvestment will be evaluated to restore degraded lands in tropical areas in the Caribbean. The goal is to be able to restore and put back into sustainable production one hectare of land for each hectare of land conserved in Qu\\xE9bec. It is an initiative which maximizes the impact of each dollar invested in the project by focusing on the natural mechanisms of increased carbon sequestration by photosynthesis in tropical zones.  With an initial commitment of $50,000, Nouveau Monde will be the project's first industrial partner. This amount will be used to conduct the technico-economic feasibility study and the preliminary design phase to be completed during Fall 2021. According to the results of the study, Nouveau Monde will make an evaluation to invest an additional $200,000 over 2 years for the commissioning of the project. Such an investment will allow Nouveau Monde to have a secure supply of carbon credits from this major offsetting project at a favorable rate - that is, at the production cost.  The United Nations Climate Change Convention on the Paris Agreement - The Framework Surrounding Environmental Responsibility and the Market Shift  Nouveau Monde's commitment and actions are part of a global effort to reduce GHG emissions in order to become environmentally responsible and accountable corporate citizens. At the heart of our actions, is the duty to care for our planet. The United Nations' Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on December 12th, 2015 and entered into force on November 4th, 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 C, preferably to 1.5 C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all participating nations to a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. Implementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social transformation, based on the best available science. The Paris Agreement works on a 5-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action. The first step is for countries to submit their plans for climate action known as nationally determined contributions (\"NDCs\"). In their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their GHG emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures. Canada has set a target to have all light-duty car sales to be electric by 2040.  As reported by Hans Eric Malin on December 15th, 2020 ( Analysis of the new EU battery regulation - Circular Energy Storage), the European Union is now working on a new Battery regulation to be adopted and progressively deployed in the next few years. The new regulation aims to introduce maximum carbon footprint and traceability. Nouveau Monde has been selected by the Global Battery Alliance (\"GBA\") as the pilot project to implement traceability of minerals for the mining and battery materials industries.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution and a multitude of means of reductions must be implemented across all countries and economic sectors both globally and locally. As stated by the GBA on their website ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/global-battery-alliance\">https://www.weforum.org/global-battery-alliance</url>), a circular and responsible battery value chain is one of the major drivers to realize the 2 C Paris Agreement goal in the transport and power sectors, setting course towards achieving the 1.5 C goal if complemented with other technologies and collaborative efforts. The transition towards cleaner sources of energy, the production and use of the strategic and critical minerals can contribute to efforts to limit rise of the temperature.  In the achievement of this global challenge, Nouveau Monde can most effectively contribute by ensuring that the production of its LiB Anode material and other advanced graphite products is carbon-neutral and with the lowest possible environmental footprint in the respect of local communities, minimizing any potentially negative impacts while enhancing the positive effects.  About Nouveau Monde  Nouveau Monde is working to position itself as a key element in the sustainable energy revolution.

(\"Nouveau Monde\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: NOU; OTCQX: NMGRD; Frankfurt: NM9) to become carbon-neutral. Nouveau Monde's mission is to \"produce the greenest advanced graphite materials with a carbon-neutral footprint for a sustainable world\" and the Company is continuously striving for excellence in minimizing Greenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") emissions and climate impact. A key piece of this GHG-mitigating ambition is the  on its Matawinie Mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints. When operational, this will result in 82% less direct GHG emissions from mining. To accelerate its deployment, Nouveau Monde is collaborating . Moreover, the use of hydroelectricity as the exclusive energy source significantly reduces the future carbon footprint of Nouveau Monde's battery material. In short, through our actions today, we are executing our Mission and driving the transition to a green future. Arne H Frandsen, Chairman of Nouveau Monde, stated: \"Nouveau Monde has committed to a Zero Harm approach to producing advanced battery materials for decades to come. Carbon neutrality is an important part of this commitment. We know that for many of our potential global clients, being able to purchase North American produced, high-quality carbon-neutral battery anode material, is of great importance. Nouveau Monde is determined to establish itself as one of the world's largest and most important sources of anode material for Lithium-Ion batteries. Nouveau Monde intends to become the Western World's first vertically-integrated, carbon-neutral anode materials producer of scale, coming to market during 2023 with our Matawinie graphite products.\" Eric Desaulniers, President and CEO of Nouveau Monde, continued: \"With approvals and the ministerial decree now in hand, it is time to deploy resources to put our vision of producing the cleanest and greenest graphite-based products possible, into concrete, measurable actions. Our Phase 1 anode materials plant at B\u00e9cancour is being build and work on our Matawinie Mine is ongoing. While building the carbon-neutral mining and battery anode material producer of the future, based in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, we are protecting our ecosystem and creating a legacy that will positively impact our communities, or clients, and the world at large.\" To meet its carbon-neutral objectives, Nouveau Monde has entered into partnership with NEL-i, a Qu\u00e9bec-based firm with expertise in climate action and GHG management solutions, to focus on three main initiatives, which represent the cornerstones of Nouveau Monde's Climate Action Plan (\"CAP\") and carbon-neutrality targets. These initiatives are outlined below and represent the path by which Nouveau Monde is now embarking to secure past, present and future \"carbon-neutral status\". 1. Carbon-neutrality of historical activities Nouveau Monde takes responsibility for its entire organisational GHG footprint ? from its time of inception in 2012 ? and will promptly act to neutralize its climate impact. From prospecting activities to operating the demonstration concentrator plant, the Company has calculated and reported GHG emissions from all direct emission sources (scope 1), indirect emissions from energy usage (scope 2) and indirect emissions (scope 3) for which the Company was responsible in the pre-commercial phase. Cumulative historical GHG emissions since the founding of the Company and up to December 31, 2020 are 2,151 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (\"t CO2 e\") (excluding changes in forest carbon stocks - the emissions from this important activity will be quantified and the offsetting will be included in the next phases set out below). To do this, all historical emissions will be offset by verified emission reductions (\"VER\"), commonly referred to as \"carbon credits\", from certified Qu\u00e9bec projects that comply with best offset practices. The supported projects are registered projects on the CSA Clean Projects Registry. They meet additionality and best practices criteria as per ISO 14064-2 standards and are third-party verified as per ISO 14064-3. Supported by the experts at NEL-i, Nouveau Monde has assembled a diversified portfolio of GHG offset units from various GHG-reducing activities including: - landfill gas capture and combustion with energy recovery; - production of renewable energy from residual forest biomass; - change in fuel selection, from fossils to bioenergy; and - energy conservation. Organizations that have developed these projects and benefited from this initiative include school boards of the Montr\u00e9al metropolitan area, Qu\u00e9bec greenhouse growers and renewable energy producers. Nouveau Monde expects that its carbon-neutral status will be official during April 2021 once the carbon credits are officially registered in the . 2. Development of the Nouveau Monde's Climate Action Plan and offsetting projects The Climate Action Plan (\"CAP\"), is a stakeholder engagement tool par excellence, for both internal and external use by organizations whose business strategy is linked to the potentiality of climate impacts. It allows the disclosure of reduction efforts, objectives and results of various initiatives, in addition to serving as a reference and guide for decision-making regarding the carbon footprint of the Company and its products. The unique nature of Nouveau Monde's operations - underpinned by Qu\u00e9bec's renewable hydroelectricity - positions the Company to have a significantly lower carbon footprint versus other operations globally. For the GHG emissions that Nouveau Monde will emit, the Company is embarking on a comprehensive CAP, in line with its Vision and Mission. As part of its CAP, Nouveau Monde is completing a monitoring plan comprised of the effective ongoing recording of GHG-related data and will be the basis for accurate GHG quantification and reporting. The organisational GHG inventory is structured to incorporate emissions at the mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints and at the value-added LiB Anode Materials Plant in B\u00e9cancour. All sources of direct emissions (scope 1) and indirect emissions (scope 3) occurring on-site during the site-preparation and construction phase, the operation and the decommissioning, as well as the indirect emissions from energy usage (scope 2) are incorporated into the Company's assessment. The fraction of forest carbon that is transferred to the atmosphere from necessary tree removal is also accounted for, reported separately, and will also be compensated. All of these emissions will be accounted for, transparently reported and subject to offsetting on a yearly basis. Due to the Company's low GHG emissions ? less than 25,000 t CO2 e/year is expected ? Nouveau Monde's projects are not subject to the Cap and Trade regulation between Qu\u00e9bec and California. Nature-based carbon sequestration projects will be identified by Nouveau Monde, with the help of NEL-i to define them and identify their scope of applicability, analyze their profitability (carbon impact), and then develop them. Nouveau Monde is also planning to invest in the research and development of effective carbon mineral storage solutions, through a \"circular economy\" approach - that is, the recycling of industrial mineral residues that are prone to carbonate and that could be used on-site for the management of tailings. Nouveau Monde will be the developer of these projects and thereby take leadership and ultimate responsibility; as its partner, NEL-i will ensure project conformity to recognized compensation mechanisms (and carbon markets). 3. Partnership in Qu\u00e9bec-wide conservation project and restoration of affected land Nouveau Monde is committed to playing an active role in the development of innovative initiatives to reduce or remove GHG from the atmosphere and counterbalance a part of its own GHG emissions. The Company is actively working on the creation of nature reserves and the development of land-based carbon sequestration projects. In doing so, Nouveau Monde reinforces a statement of trust in nature-based solutions to effectively achieve net-zero GHG emissions and recognizes the inherent value of our environment and all the social, cultural, economic and environmental co-benefits of healthy ecosystems for our communities. NEL-i is developing the first large-scale forest carbon stock enhancement project in Qu\u00e9bec. This project incorporates initiatives for conservation, improvement of harvesting and reforestation practices across Qu\u00e9bec. It involves small and large forest landowners in addition to regional conservation organizations that seek to maintain and enhance ecosystems by monetizing their potential for increased sequestration. As part of this project, a reinvestment will be evaluated to restore degraded lands in tropical areas in the Caribbean. The goal is to be able to restore and put back into sustainable production one hectare of land for each hectare of land conserved in Qu\u00e9bec. It is an initiative which maximizes the impact of each dollar invested in the project by focusing on the natural mechanisms of increased carbon sequestration by photosynthesis in tropical zones. With an initial commitment of $50,000, Nouveau Monde will be the project's first industrial partner. This amount will be used to conduct the technico-economic feasibility study and the preliminary design phase to be completed during Fall 2021. According to the results of the study, Nouveau Monde will make an evaluation to invest an additional $200,000 over 2 years for the commissioning of the project. Such an investment will allow Nouveau Monde to have a secure supply of carbon credits from this major offsetting project at a favorable rate - that is, at the production cost. The United Nations Climate Change Convention on the Paris Agreement - The Framework Surrounding Environmental Responsibility and the Market Shift Nouveau Monde's commitment and actions are part of a global effort to reduce GHG emissions in order to become environmentally responsible and accountable corporate citizens. At the heart of our actions, is the duty to care for our planet. The United Nations' Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on December 12th, 2015 and entered into force on November 4th, 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 C, preferably to 1.5 C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all participating nations to a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. Implementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social transformation, based on the best available science. The Paris Agreement works on a 5-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action. The first step is for countries to submit their plans for climate action known as nationally determined contributions (\"NDCs\"). In their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their GHG emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures. Canada has set a target to have all light-duty car sales to be electric by 2040. As reported by Hans Eric Malin on December 15th, 2020 (), the European Union is now working on a new Battery regulation to be adopted and progressively deployed in the next few years. The new regulation aims to introduce maximum carbon footprint and traceability. Nouveau Monde has been selected by the Global Battery Alliance (\"GBA\") as the pilot project . There is no one-size-fits-all solution and a multitude of means of reductions must be implemented across all countries and economic sectors both globally and locally. As stated by the GBA on their website (), a circular and responsible battery value chain is one of the major drivers to realize the 2 C Paris Agreement goal in the transport and power sectors, setting course towards achieving the 1.5 C goal if complemented with other technologies and collaborative efforts. The transition towards cleaner sources of energy, the production and use of the strategic and critical minerals can contribute to efforts to limit rise of the temperature. In the achievement of this global challenge, Nouveau Monde can most effectively contribute by ensuring that the production of its LiB Anode material and other advanced graphite products is carbon-neutral and with the lowest possible environmental footprint in the respect of local communities, minimizing any potentially negative impacts while enhancing the positive effects. About Nouveau Monde Nouveau Monde is working to position itself as a key element in the sustainable energy revolution.

Mountains are the source of all mighty rivers, and their fragile environment demands that our water solutions be as nature-based as possible.</p><p>In the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, an area that extends 3,500 kilometres across all or part of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, the drying of natural springs is an issue for which there are nature-based solutions available.</p><p>Springs, which are groundwater discharge points where the water-bearing layer in the mountains and hills intersect with the ground surface, are unique to the mountain landscapes. In our HKH region, even by a conservative estimate, there are close to five million springs. These springs are the lifeline of water security in the region and provide water for drinking, and domestic and irrigation purposes.</p><p>Most mountain towns also depend on these springs for urban water supply. Springs perform very important ecological functions by providing base flows to rivers and sustaining rich biota. Springs are also important from cultural and religious points of view and are often worshipped by the local communities.</p><p>There is anecdotal evidence from all across the HKH that these natural springs are drying. There are multiple causes for drying of springs \u2013 changing rainfall and temperature patterns due to climate change; changes in land use and land cover, including infrastructure projects such as road construction and hydropower; and increased demand for spring water due to demographic changes and changing lifestyles. Drying of springs causes multiple hardships for local mountain people for whom springs are the only accessible and safe source of water.</p><p>Most settlements in the mid-hills and mountains of the HKH region are on the ridge top while glacier-fed perennial rivers flow at the valley bottoms and the glaciers themselves are too far away to access. These hardships are compounded for the marginalized \u2013women, dalits (the so-called \u201clower\u201d caste among Hindus), and the ethnic minorities \u2013 who often withstand the worst of this water scarcity.</p><p>So how can we use nature-based solutions to preserve our natural springs? Given that springs are groundwater discharge points, there has to be a recharge area somewhere above. Very simply put, imagine the recharge areas are the water tanks on our roofs, and the springs are taps in our bathrooms and kitchen\u2013 unless the tank on the roof is full, the taps will not yield water. Spring discharge can be increased in most cases by enhancing recharge in the recharge zone. This begs the question \u2013 how do we identify the recharge zone?</p><p>The answer to this question brings us to the realm of hydrogeology \u2013 the science of understanding groundwater, based on the knowledge of underground geology or rock structure. Put simply, the Himalaya are one of the most complex geological structures in the world. The presence or absence of groundwater is dictated by the kinds of rock (some rocks have inherently more water bearing capacity than others); the natural dip and strike (that is inclination) of these rocks; and by the numerous faults and fractures in these rocks \u2013 faults and fractures can hold water even if the rock itself is impermeable.</p><p>Using simple field-level geology that most villagers can understand after some training, we can go about demarcating recharge areas. Over the course of working on spring recharge with villagers, we have observed that local communities often have good intuition guiding them to probable recharge areas.</p><p>Historically, these recharge areas had ponds dug in them, but over the years, many such ponds have become neglected and dried as a result. However, local communities still carry anecdotal stories about the role these ridge top ponds play in recharging springs in their villages. Community members are able to see the connection between recharge and discharge quite easily.</p><p>Once such recharge areas are identified using field geology and local knowledge, nature-based solutions and simple watershed interventions can be deployed to revive springs. Nature-based solutions include the use of vegetative measures such as hedgerows and palisades (small natural dams with local vegetation) to enhance recharge in identified recharge areas. Nature-based solutions would also include planting of suitable species for water conservations.</p><p>In the humid and sub-humid mid-hills of the Himalaya, for example, broad-leafed deciduous trees are generally better at water retention and recharge than coniferous trees like pines, although this might differ with altitudinal and climatic conditions.</p><p>Nature-based approaches to spring recharge have been implemented successfully in the Indian Himalaya, particularly in the states of Sikkim and Uttarakhand. There is a national policy for spring recharge in place in all 11 Indian mountain states. In Nepal, these approaches have been successfully implemented in the far western district of Dailekh.</p><p>As a result, the amount of spring discharge in the dry season (November\u2013March) has increased considerably, even doubling in some cases to substantially increase local water security.</p><p>This approach of using simple geology to demarcate recharge areas and then to carry out recharge interventions in those areas has been well tested and tried. A policy push is now required. Local governments in the new federal Nepal need to be empowered to train their human resources in the nature-based identification of recharge areas and recharge of springs, and then invest their resources in such recharge activities.</p><p>Other countries in the HKH can also learn from successful spring revival work done on a pilot basis in India and Nepal, and put policies in place that use nature-based solutions to preserve one of our purest sources of natural water \u2013 the mountain springs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(The writer is a human geographer by training and heads the Water and Air theme at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Kuensel (Bhutan)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["The theme for World Water Day this year is Nature for Water.

The benchmarks from the World Meteorological Organization's State of the Climate report indicate that 'the point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and is hurtling towards us,' the UN chief said in a news conference on the eve of a two-week international climate conference in Spain's capital Madrid.  'The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded. Sea levels are at the highest in human history', he said after revealing the key takeaways from the UN climate agency's report, which is due to be published during COP25.  Guterres said he expects a clear demonstration of increased climate action ambition and commitment out of COP25, which kicks off Monday.   This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was canceled by the government due to weeks of civil unrest.  He called on leaders of all countries to show accountability, responsibility and leadership to end the global climate crisis. 'Anything less wold be a betrayal of our entire human family and all generations to come,' according to him.  Scientists have provided a road map away from the 'point of no return', which will help limit global temperature rise to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels, by 2030.   The UN chief noted that efforts so far have been 'utterly inadequate.'  While noting that 'the signals of hope are multiplying,' Guterres blamed lack of political will as the key missing ingredient.  'Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels, or to shift taxation from income to carbon, taxing pollution instead of people.'   The Secretary General insisted that digging and drilling must stop, and be replaced by renewable energy and nature-based solutions to drastically slow climate change.    He said at least $100 billion dollars must be made available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and to take into account their 'legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery.'   'We are in a deep hole and we are are still digging. Soon it will be too deep to escape,' Guterres told reporters.  The Secretary-General named the head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, as the UN's new Special Envoy for Climate Action.   Describing the Canadian as 'a remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to act on climate', Guterres said the new envoy would be focusing on ambitious implementation of action, especially shifting markets and mobilizing private finance, towards limiting global warming to the key 1.5 degrees mark.   Carney replaces former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is running for Democratic presidential candidacy.   The United Nations estimates that if current trends persist, the global temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.4 to 3.9\\xB0C this century, which would bring wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts.  COP25 comes in the background of the United States commencing the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, 28 months after President Donald Trump announced his decision saying the global pact was unfair to the world's largest economy.   The United States is the only one of the 195 signatories to the historic agreement - to keep CO2 emissions to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - to pull out of it.      </p>", "publisher": "dpa-AFX International ProFeed", "instances": ["'Political will to put a price on carbon.

Likewise, the role of trees in addressing the climate change problem has received much attention in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) special report on \u201cClimate Change and Land\u201d. However, planting trees is not a silver bullet against climate change and it should be a part of an inclusive action plan to address the climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Planting trees is no substitute for natural forests. A recent study published in \u201cFrontiers in Forests and Global Change\u201d shows that growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential\u2014termed \u201cProforestation\u201d\u2014is a more effective, immediate, and low-cost approach for removing and storing GHGs in the long-term. Proforestation signifies protecting and stewarding intact forests/ecosystems\u2014largely free from human interventions except primarily for trails and hazard removals\u2014and restoring natural forests. This approach could be implemented across suitable forests of all types.</p><p>Proforestation serves a crucial service by maximising co-benefits such as nature-based biological carbon sequestration\u2014the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plants to then be stored in vegetation and soils\u2014and unparalleled services to the ecosystem. It also provides long-term benefits for biodiversity, climate resilience, and human benefits. Proforestation has the potential to provide additional carbon sequestration to reduce net emissions in the US by much more than the 11 percent that forests provide currently, according to research.</p><p>Afforestation and reforestation face significant challenges. Afforestation requires an enormous amount of additional land, which would be a considerable barrier to feed nine billion people by 2050. Besides, neither strategy can remove sufficient carbon by growing young trees during the critical next decade(s), a study indicates.</p><p>\u201cNatural climate solutions\u201d\u2014conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions\u2014have the potential to increase carbon storage and avoid GHGs. However, existing proposals for natural climate solutions do not consider explicitly the potential of proforestation.</p><p>A more recent paper in the journal Science, entitled \u201cThe global tree restoration potential\u201d, explains that the restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. \u201cA trillion trees could be planted\u201d to address the changing climate problem, the paper estimates.</p><p>The \u201cClimate Change and Land\u201d report summarised that while some response options have immediate impact such as the conservation of high-carbon ecosystems: peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests; other options, such as afforestation and reforestation as well as the reclamation of degraded soils, take decades to deliver measurable results. These examples indicate that restoring and protecting the existing ecosystems are more effective than tree plantations, in terms of getting adaptation and mitigation benefits within a short time.</p><p>The concept of \u201cnature-based solutions\u201d can be misinterpreted by prioritising and investing in more tree plantations (either through afforestation and reforestation), which is one of the popular initiatives for addressing climate change, taken by the government. According to Science, the primary climate solution is the \u201cprotection\u201d, \u201cstewardship\u201d and \u201crestoration\u201d of carbon-rich intact ecosystems/natural forests.</p><p>Natural forests (including soils) store more carbon than is found in the atmosphere. Their loss and degradation would trigger emissions that would cause global warming to exceed 2 degree C, crossing the 1.5 degree C threshold. Mature forests can adapt to changing conditions and store more carbon than young, degraded or plantation forests.</p><p>The latest IPCC report sheds light on the Sundarban\u2019s present condition. The report mentions that, \u201clarge areas of the Sundarban mangroves have been converted into paddy fields over the past two centuries and more recently into shrimp farms.\u201d They warn coastal land erosion could be expedited as a result of the destruction of mangrove forests and wetlands.</p><p>Deforestation is the conversion of forest to non-forest land and can result in land degradation. In some areas, emissions from degradation can exceed those of deforestation, studies indicate. Once damaged, natural ecosystems are more exposed to further impacts from climatic and non-climatic stressors.</p><p>Avoiding further loss and degradation of natural forests and intact ecosystems, and allowing degraded forests to regrow naturally, would reduce global carbon emissions annually by about one gigaton (Gt), and reduce another two to four Gts of carbon emissions through just allowing natural regrowth, one study estimates.</p><p>A study published in the Nature journal estimates that increasing canopy cover through natural regeneration of degraded forests could have superior climate benefits over the course of the century than establishing new plantations.</p><p>Restoring natural forests have, therefore, received huge attention from scientists and policymakers. The German government and the IUCN launched the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 Mha of forest by 2030.</p><p>Under this challenge and other national schemes, 43 countries in the tropics and subtropics have pledged to restore forests to sequester carbon. For instance, Vietnam is allowing 14.6 Mha to return to natural forest, which is the world\u2019s most substantial commitment of this nature.</p><p>Proforestation provides the most effective solution to the dual global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. It does not require additional land beyond what is already forested and provides new forest related opportunities along with quantifiable ecosystem services. However, effective actions are indispensable to make the most of it.</p><p>Politicians have to recognise that proforestation is a better means of GHGs removal than other options. Our government must identify suitable (public) forest lands for protection and reservation for proforestation. Our government must also realise that implementing (and reorienting) existing forest regulations are a sine qua non of growing intact forest ecosystems. Proforestation requires explicit support of the (updated) \u201cBangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan.\u201d It is a practical, economical, and effective mechanism of GHGs removal. Without revamping forest governance, however, it will be hard to implement it.</p><p>(Ranjan Roy, Ph.D, is an Associate Professor at the Department of Agricultural Extension and Information System, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Daily Star (Bangladesh)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["The \u201cClimate Change and Land\u201d report summarised that while some response options have immediate impact such as the conservation of high-carbon ecosystems: peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests; other options, such as afforestation and reforestation as well as the reclamation of degraded soils, take decades to deliver measurable results.

If it can succeed it will win a priceless prize: it will achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming to under 2C. It is the puzzle of the energy transition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Piecing together a solution is going to be tricky and we at Shell have been trying to make progress as a company. We have a way forward now and I am going to share it with you\u2026 but, first, the jigsaw.</p><p>Part of the challenge is that the world has to stop adding to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, probably by 2070 according to credible scenarios.</p><p>That is hard enough to achieve but there is more to it than that: large parts of the world\u2019s population still live without access to safe, reliable and affordable energy. The world\u2019s population is growing and, as living standards rise, energy demand could double over the course of the century.</p><p>All of this must be part of the solution, part of the picture, too. We must work together to meet this challenge and we will not succeed by leaving others out.</p><p>Fitting the pieces together means working with a large array of energy sources: coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind and geothermal among them. It also means understanding the almost infinite uses for that energy: heating and cooling, domestic and industrial, transporting people and goods.</p><p>It is no wonder that many people are looking for a simple answer. No more oil, gas or coal, just renewable energy. But that is no more possible than instantly solving a jigsaw.</p><p>Perhaps, as CEO of Shell, I might be expected to argue this. But, deep down, I suspect most people distrust the simple answer just as much as I do.</p><p>The real answer is multi-faceted, working across the whole energy system and involves all of society: governments and consumers, businesses, non-governmental organisations and academia. And, of course, it involves companies like Shell too.</p><p>I hear so many suggestions for what Shell should do. There is a multitude of proposals, expectations and policy suggestions. We should abandon this or that project or business, reduce emissions, increase efficiency, sell less, produce more biofuel, stop drilling for oil, produce more natural gas\u2026 for some, we should simply cease to exist.</p><p>Admittedly, Shell has not always done a good job of explaining what our role is in this global challenge and what we can contribute. But we have been working hard on it and</p><p>have come to the conclusion there is, in fact, only one way that truly matters: to set ourselves to the same task as the rest of society. To have the same aim.</p><p>If society is to stop adding to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2070, it must halve the amount of such gases produced for each unit of energy used by 2050.</p><p>Shell must follow the same aim and it should deliver a mix of energy products that will help society - through our customers - achieve it.</p><p>That is why Shell now intends to cut in half the net carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050. It will do so in step with society, reviewing and reporting on our progress every five years to ensure we neither fall behind nor get too far ahead.</p><p>To get to that point, Shell has further to go than others because we have so much oil and gas in our energy mix, little wind and solar to date, and no hydro or nuclear. We will have to catch up.</p><p>But 2050 is a long way away. We must all make rapid progress before then. So by 2035, Shell aims to reduce the net carbon footprint of its energy mix by around 20 per cent. Can society do what it has to? Yes, if we work together.</p><p>Can Shell do this? Yes, if we use all the tools we have at hand. That means more natural gas, because it produces half the CO2 (carbon dioxide) of coal when used to generate power. More biofuels, more renewable power and better energy efficiency in our operations.</p><p>Carbon capture and storage on a wider scale is needed to put some of our CO2 emissions safely underground. And nature-based solutions are also necessary: Shell will support the development of new forests and wetlands to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p><p>The company is already doing all of this but it will do much more.</p><p>Do I know exactly how much solar Shell will have in our energy mix by 2035? How much in wind, biofuels or gas? How many carbon capture facilities? How many trees we will help to grow? No. The details are unknowable right now. Much will depend on how governments behave, how consumers act and how technology evolves. Our aspiration may evolve as well.</p><p>But Shell\u2019s ambition today is clear. We know the part we can play. We will play that part with humility because we don\u2019t have an easy solution to the puzzle. No one does. We will play our part with sound financial discipline because destroying the value of the company helps no one.</p><p>And we will play our part with conviction because otherwise progress will be too slow.

This means that projects in this area will need to start ramping up<br/>on a massive scale.<br/>\"Only a global effort will be able to deliver removals at scale\" says Mhairidh<br/>Evans, Global Head of CCUS Research. \"However, trade-off with other social needs<br/>is still inevitable, given the volume of projects required.\"<br/>The report states that to achieve this goal, three key things must happen.<br/>Carbon removals must be monetised, governments must set national carbon removal<br/>targets and provide sufficient incentives and stimulate demand and developers<br/>need to deliver projects at cost levels that make removals an attractive option<br/>based on expected future carbon prices.<br/>The report adds that nature-based solutions such as afforestation and soil<br/>carbon offer the greatest potential for scale at a lower cost per tonne than<br/>engineered solutions with many deployment opportunities available below<br/>US$100/tonne of CO2. This compares favourably with engineered solutions that<br/>currently range between US$100 and US$1,000/tonne.<br/>Furthermore, some of the world's highest emissions emitting countries such as<br/>the US, Brazil, China, Indonesia and India have land resources available to<br/>accommodate huge removals projects on a gigatonne scale.<br/>However, the carbon removals project sector remains too risky for many investors<br/>because of inconsistent policy support from governments worldwide.<br/>\"Government policy and incentives are the driving force behind the sharp rise in<br/>planned engineered projects across North America and Europe, which host over<br/>95% of capacity announced to date,\" says Evans. \"To deliver on the required<br/>scale, nature-based solutions will require greater support from governments<br/>around the globe.\"<br/>The report also states that the investing in carbon removals can be difficult<br/>because, unlike renewable energy or clean fuels, there is usually no \"product\"<br/>produced. This can make the value of a project hard to define and financial<br/>value often comes from stacking different sources of income. These include<br/>voluntary and compliance carbon markets, direct corporate buyers, government<br/>incentives and by-product sales - but values vary greatly around the world.<br/>Carbon markets are the primary mechanism for translating emissions mitigation<br/>from removals into a monetisable commodity.<br/>\"With a carbon price, governments and companies would be able to put a monetary<br/>value on having less CO2 in the atmosphere.\" Says Evans. \"Companies need to be<br/>willing to pay for this in the voluntary market, while governments could create<br/>a regulated mandatory market, where companies can trade removal credits. We see<br/>an increasing role for removals in compliance markets\"<br/>Wood Mackenzie forecasts show that currently committed voluntary carbon market<br/>participants will demand more than 1.7 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent (BtCO2e)<br/>a year of avoidance and removal carbon offsets by 2050. Demand could more than<br/>triple if the controversial issues of market integrity, trustworthiness of<br/>monitoring, reporting and verification, and offset quality are resolved<br/>quickly.<br/>The report also states that governments should also use their purchasing power<br/>to stimulate demand. Other initiatives along these lines also includes<br/>government-to-government trading which would achieve better global equity and<br/>encourage investment in removals projects in developing countries.<br/>The report adds that while strong governmental support is essential to kick-<br/>start projects, developers also have to work hard to deliver the right cost<br/>levels to attract potential investors. For Direct Air Capture, one of the most<br/>promising removals technologies, this will require supply-chain optimisation, a<br/>step-change in energy consumption, larger project sizes and the application of<br/>next-generation capture technologies.<br/>The report concludes that nature-based solutions will deliver 90% of carbon<br/>removals in Wood Mackenzie's base case. Engineered removals come at a higher<br/>cost but will be essential at gigatonne scale to help the world reach net zero.<br/>\"The promise of carbon removals is clear.

Economic losses caused by natural catastrophes reached an estimated USD\u00a0280\u00a0billion in 2023, with USD\u00a051.6\u00a0billion due to floods, according to Swiss Re Institute. Losses are likely to increase as climate change intensifies extreme weather events while rapid urban sprawl has increased asset values in high-risk areas. Protective measures such as dykes, dams and flood gates come at a price, but their financial benefits can exceed costs for rebuilding after a disaster by up to ten times, a Swiss Re Institute study shows. Veronica Scotti, Chairperson Public Sector Solutions at Swiss Re said: \"Investments in climate adaptation, such as flood preparedness, not only promote economic stability and create jobs, but also help keep people safe. Yet there is chronic underfunding. It is therefore crucial to create the conditions for private capital to flow into climate adaptation projects and at the same time optimise the use of public funds. Quantifying the benefits of adaptation measures is a key step towards facilitating public-private investment and ultimately closing the huge financing gap.\" To determine how effective investments in flood adaptation measures can be, it is important to quantify their financial benefits. Swiss\u00a0Re Institute has carried out a study comparing economic benefits and cost ratios of selected flood adaptation measures. This value can serve as a guideline for investment decisions and help identify the best flood adaptation methods to ensure a community's economic stability, safety and resilience.  Benefit-to-cost ratio can vary significantly depending on the region. Swiss\u00a0Re Institute research shows that grey infrastructure, such as dykes and levees, is highly effective in reducing coastal flood damage. Globally, their benefits can outweigh costs by two to seven times, and even up to ten times in flood-prone areas. Built to optimal standards, these structures can reduce flood damage by 60-90%, especially in densely populated regions. In less populated areas, nature-based solutions such as barrier island restoration or foreshore vegetation can be equally effective.  Similarly, policy interventions, such as land use restrictions, can enhance the value of flood prevention, particularly in emerging economies. Flood defences and, zoning restrictions are found to be almost twice as effective and feasible than accommodative measures, such as dry proofing for both coastal and river floods. All flood interventions, especially when upgraded and maintained, can benefit both insurers and policyholders. The public and private sectors can work together in facilitating and accelerating risk adaptation: by focusing on preventing and reducing future flood losses, the public sector can shift the remaining risks to the re/insurance industry and support economic stability after disasters. By being involved in the early stages of planning protection measures, the re/insurance industry can help mitigate risks and provide financial protection. Download report  \"Resilience or rebuild?

Wo will denn lieber hin, wer in grosser Not seine Heimat verlassen muss, wenn er die Wahl h\u00e4tte?</p><p>D\u00fcrfen wir unsere Grenzen schliessen und nur diejenigen Menschen einlassen, die unseren Wohlstand noch weiter mehren, die Attraktivit\u00e4t unseres Landes noch weiter steigern?

Nur, weitermachen wie bisher ist auch keine gute L\u00f6sung. Warum? Weil das meiste Geld heutzutage zur Degradierung der B\u00f6den, zur Vergiftung der Umwelt, zur Vernichtung der Biodiversit\u00e4t, zur Produktion von Treibhausgasen, in die Missachtung des Tierwohls, zur Verbilligung der schon sehr billigen Lebensmittel und nicht zuletzt auch zu schlechteren Lebensbedingungen der landwirtschaftlichen Arbeitskr\u00e4fte f\u00fchrt.</p><p>Allein schon wegen der Klimaerw\u00e4rmung und ihrer Folgen f\u00fcr den Wasserhaushalt wird sich die Schweizer Landwirtschaft strukturell anpassen m\u00fcssen.

K\u00f6rner argumentiert, dass die Speicherung von Kohlenstoff in B\u00e4umen ein Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell mit Ablaufdatum sei und die gleichzeitige Nutzung des nachwachsenden Rohstoffes Holz verhindere.</p><p>W\u00e4hrend es stimmt, dass B\u00e4ume nicht ewig wachsen und die Speicherung von Kohlenstoff in der Baumbiomasse zeitlich begrenzt ist, werden dabei zwei wichtige Aspekte \u00fcbersehen: Bis weit nach 2050 k\u00f6nnen W\u00e4lder einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Klimabilanz leisten.</p><p>Die Notwendigkeit negativer Emissionen zur Erreichung des Netto-Null-Ziels bis 2050 ist unbestritten. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, reicht es nicht aus, die CO2-Emissionen nur zu reduzieren. Es muss auch aktiv CO2 aus der Atmosph\u00e4re entzogen werden.</p><p>Hier sind die sogenannten \u00abnature-based solutions\u00bb derzeit die einzigen realistischen Methoden. Dies bedeutet, dass wir den Biomassenvorrat im Wald erh\u00f6hen und so der Atmosph\u00e4re CO2 entziehen m\u00fcssen.

Heute ist mehr denn je auch der Landschaftsarchitekt gefragt. Denn nur \u00fcber die Natur und ihren \u201eFreir\u00e4umen\u201c k\u00f6nnen wir Stadtr\u00e4ume als urbane Landschaften neu denken, die vom Menschen und seinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen ausgehen.</p><p>Die Gewinnung von Freir\u00e4umen wird zu einer Zukunftsaufgabe. Eine Zeitwende steht an, in der D\u00e4cher gr\u00fcne Landschaften bilden, der Boden aufgebrochen wird und unter- wie \u00fcberirdisch neue Fl\u00e4chen gestaltet werden k\u00f6nnen. Dass es geht und wie es geht, haben uns die drei Architekturb\u00fcros am Beispiel der Corneliusstra\u00dfe gezeigt. Klimaschutz, Mobilit\u00e4t, Energie beginnt in unseren H\u00e4usern und l\u00e4sst sich \u00fcber einen intelligenten, Ressourcen schonenden Umbau und in Teilen R\u00fcckbau im st\u00e4ndigen Wandel erreichen. Die gesunde, resiliente Stadt f\u00e4ngt in den Stra\u00dfen, auf D\u00e4chern und Pl\u00e4tzen, in unseren Parkanlagen und in Wohnvierteln an. Sie ist bed\u00fcrfnisorientiert und auf Gemeinwohl ausgerichtet. Es geht wieder um uns, um uns Menschen, die Orte und R\u00e4ume zum Atmen und zum Leben im Alltag einfordern.</p><p>Dementsprechend sind Freiraum und bebaute Strukturen keine Gegens\u00e4tze, sondern vielfach und holistisch miteinander verbunden. Sichtachsen und Wegf\u00fchrungen k\u00f6nnen zwischen den materiellen und manchmal immateriellen Kontexten, die in urbanen R\u00e4umen aufeinander treffen, vermitteln. F\u00fcr unsere St\u00e4dte hei\u00dft das: Agieren im Bestand eines Beziehungsgef\u00fcges baulicher, r\u00e4umlicher, sozialer und wirtschaftlicher Bindungen. Vielfalt tritt an Stelle von Uniformit\u00e4t. So wird zum Beispiel eine Stra\u00dfe nicht l\u00e4nger als Line, als Verkehrsachse verstanden, sondern als ein mit unterschiedlichen Aufgaben durchmischter \u00f6ffentlicher Raum.</p><p>Wir brauchen Schattenfl\u00e4chen, gr\u00fcne Lungen und Regeng\u00e4rten, in die Wasser abflie\u00dft und die uns vor \u00dcberflutungen bewahren.

So eine Art Staubsauger f\u00fcr die Luft, um der Atmosph\u00e4re CO2 zu entziehen - kann das funktionieren? Es muss, wenn die Menschheit das Klimaziel von m\u00f6glichst maximal 1,5 Grad Erderhitzung erreichen will. Da sind sich Experten einig. Zuletzt hat das auch der Weltklimarat klargemacht. Was die Menschheit schon tut und noch tun muss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\" B\u00e4ume pflanzen allein hilft nicht: Es gibt nat\u00fcrliche Wege wie Aufforstung. B\u00e4ume nehmen w\u00e4hrend ihres Wachstums CO2 auf. Auch Humus-Schichten im Boden bunkern Treibhausgase. Die Experten sprechen von ,,nature based solutions\". Diese L\u00f6sungen haben aber einen Haken: ,,Es ist unklar, wie viel CO2 langfristig gespeichert bleibt\", sagt Jessica Strefler vom Potsdam-Institut f\u00fcr Klimafolgenforschung (PIK). D\u00fcrren, St\u00fcrme, Borkenk\u00e4fer k\u00f6nnen ganze Waldbest\u00e4nde zusammenbrechen lassen, das CO2 wird in der Folge wieder freigesetzt. Auch der Humusaufbau ist umkehrbar, der Kohlenstoff kann jederzeit wieder als CO2 in die Luft entweichen. Bringt das also alles gar nichts? ,,Nein, solche L\u00f6sungen werden gebraucht, sie sind nicht teuer, tendenziell auch gut f\u00fcr den Boden\", sagt Strefler, ,,sie reichen nur nicht.\" Gefragt ist neue Technik.</p><p>\" CO2-F\u00e4nger: Kann man Algen im Meer mit Eisensulfat d\u00fcngen, sodass diese st\u00e4rker wachsen und der Atmosph\u00e4re gef\u00e4hrliches Treibhausgas entziehen? Als Geo-Ingenieure diesen Eingriff am Ozean vor Jahren erwogen, war das umstritten. Mittlerweile werden aber ganz andere Techniken entwickelt, um einmal ausgesto\u00dfenes CO2 wieder zur\u00fcckzuholen. Im Fachjargon sind das ,,negative Emissionen\". Und diese betrachtet nicht nur Wissenschaftlerin Strefler als Br\u00fccke in die klimaneutrale Welt. Auch die Bundesregierung will Ziele f\u00fcr negative Emissionen f\u00fcr die Jahre 2035, 2040 und 2045 festlegen. Das entlasse Deutschland nicht aus der Pflicht, schnell und drastisch Emissionen zu mindern, erkl\u00e4rt Strefler. Es gehe vielmehr um Restemissionen, also um jene Treibhausgase, die sich zum Beispiel in der Zementindustrie oder auch der D\u00fcngemittelproduktion kaum vermeiden lassen.</p><p>\" Aus der Luft filtern: Die Anlage Orca auf Island galt als Durchbruch, als sie 2021 vom Schweizer Unternehmen Climeworks in Betrieb genommen wurde: Sie kann 4000 Tonnen CO2 pro Jahr aus der Luft filtern. Derzeit wird der Nachfolger Mammoth gebaut. Aber auch in der Schweiz und in Kanada gibt es Pilotanlagen f\u00fcr diese Direct Air Capture genannte Technik. Mit riesigen Ventilatoren wird Luft aus der Umgebung durch die Anlage geblasen, das CO2 bleibt an einem Filter h\u00e4ngen. Dann wird es bei Temperaturen um 100 Grad Celsius in Wasser gel\u00f6st. Das CO2-haltige Wasser wird vom isl\u00e4ndischen Partnerunternehmen Carbfix im tiefen Vulkangestein eingelagert. Das enth\u00e4lt Kalzium, Magnesium und Eisen und reagiert im Laufe der Zeit mit dem gel\u00f6sten CO2. Es entsteht Kalziumkarbonat - Kalk. ,,Das CO2 wird in fester Form und damit langfristig gespeichert\", sagt PIK-Expertin Strefler. Es gibt aber auch andere Methoden.</p><p>\" Energiepflanzen: Ob und wie Mais und andere Pflanzen angebaut werden sollten, um aus ihnen Energie statt Futter- oder Lebensmittel zu gewinnen, ist eine lange w\u00e4hrende Debatte. Jedenfalls nehmen Energiepflanzen beim Wachstum CO2 auf. Und derzeit werden sie oft zur Strom- und W\u00e4rmeerzeugung verbrannt, um Energie zu gewinnen. Dabei wird das CO2 dann wieder frei. Dieses soll bei der Methode ,,Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage\" eingefangen und auch im Untergrund gespeichert werden. Das von Robert Habeck gef\u00fchrte Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz schreibt auf seiner Homepage: ,,Zu ber\u00fccksichtigen ist jedoch, dass nachhaltig erzeugte Biomasse nur im begrenzten Umfang verf\u00fcgbar ist.\" Es wird nur ein Baustein von vielen sein.</p><p>\" Platz unter dem Meer: Die unterirdische Speicherung von CO2 war in Deutschland lange Zeit umstritten. Das bisher einzige CO2-Speicherprojekt in Deutschland befindet sich westlich von Berlin in Ketzin. Das sei in anderen L\u00e4ndern anders, hei\u00dft es auf der Ministeriums-Homepage: ,,Die geologische Speicherung von CO2 wird weltweit seit Jahrzehnten praktiziert - von kleinen Pilot- bis hin zu gro\u00dfen Industrieprojekten und unter verschiedenen geologischen Rahmenbedingungen.\" Gro\u00dfe Speicher l\u00e4gen zum Beispiel unter der Nordsee.</p><p>\" CO2 als Rohstoff: Der Leverkusener Chemiekonzern Covestro zum Beispiel setzt CO2 bei der Kunststoffproduktion ein. Der Begriff daf\u00fcr: Carbon Capture and Utilization, CCU. Das Unternehmen verwendet das Treibhausgas als alternativen Rohstoff f\u00fcr die Herstellung von Polycarbonat, das zum Beispiel in Autokarosserien, medizinischen Ger\u00e4ten, Stadiond\u00e4chern stecken kann. Auch f\u00fcr den Schaumstoff etwa von Ma\u00adtratzen oder Polsterm\u00f6beln wird CO2 genutzt. Auch Carbonfasern lassen sich aus CO2 herstellen. Allerdings wird das CO2 am Ende des Matratzenlebens wieder freigesetzt, wenn sie verbrannt werden.</p><p>\" Grenzen: ,,Es gibt nicht die eine, die beste Option. Wir m\u00fcssen jede angucken\", sagt Jan Christoph Minx, der am Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change zum Stand der Techniken forscht. Er hat erst Anfang des Jahres zusammen mit einem internationalen Wissenschaftsteam eine ,,Bestandsaufnahme\" gemacht. Demnach werden die technischen Methoden noch viel zu wenig vorangetrieben. Bisher w\u00fcrden sie j\u00e4hrlich gerade mal 0,002 Gigatonnen CO2 aus der Atmosph\u00e4re nehmen. Um die Klimaziele zu erreichen, m\u00fcssten das schon 2050 1300 Mal mehr sein.</p><p>\" Weitere Methoden: Die Potsdamer Klimaforscherin Strefler z\u00e4hlt noch zwei weitere Methoden auf. Pflanzenreste k\u00f6nnten verkohlt und diese Biokohle dann auf den B\u00f6den aufgebracht werden. Der in den Pflanzen enthaltene Kohlenstoff bleibe so im Boden. Auch die beschleunigte Verwitterung sei eine Variante: Basalt oder Kalkgestein binden Kohlendioxid, wenn sie verwittern. Zermahlt man die Gesteine, wird die Oberfl\u00e4che gr\u00f6\u00dfer und die Verwitterung schneller. K\u00f6nnte man sich dann bei der Minderung der Treibhausgase entspannen? ,,Auf keinen Fall\", erkl\u00e4rt Strefler, ,,mit keiner der Techniken l\u00e4sst sich beliebig viel CO2 wieder einfangen, es gibt immer Grenzen, weil zum Beispiel zu viel Energie n\u00f6tig w\u00e4re oder eine zu gro\u00dfe Landfl\u00e4che.\" </p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"52555962\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26643\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p>", "publisher": "General-Anzeiger Bonn", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 39, "title": "EQS-News: Partners Group signs carbon dioxide removal agreement with Climeworks, a leading provider of high-quality carbon dioxide removal via direct air capture (DAC) (english)", "published": "2023-04-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Partners Group signs carbon dioxide removal agreement with Climeworks, a leading provider of high-quality carbon dioxide removal via direct air capture (DAC)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>Partners Group / Key word(s): ESG<br/>Partners Group signs carbon dioxide removal agreement with Climeworks, a<br/>leading provider of high-quality carbon dioxide removal via direct air<br/>capture (DAC)</pre></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">19.04.2023 / 08:01 CET/CEST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Baar-Zug, Switzerland; 19 April 2023</p><p>* Climeworks will remove more than 7,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide<br/>    from the atmosphere on Partners Group's behalf</p><p>* The agreement represents Partners Group's first use of a technological<br/>    solution to help meet its net zero commitments</p><p>* Partners Group co-led a CHF 600 million fundraising round in Climeworks<br/>    in 2022</p><p>Partners Group, a leading global private markets firm, has signed a 13-year<br/>agreement with Climeworks (or \"the Company\"), a leading Swiss provider of<br/>high-quality carbon dioxide removal via direct air capture (DAC).

Through this<br/>accelerated natural process, the CO2 turns into stone and is permanently<br/>removed from the air for thousands of years. This full DAC and storage<br/>process is third-party verified by an independent quality and assurance<br/>leader.

Das enth\u00e4lt Kalzium, Magnesium und Eisen und reagiert im Laufe der Zeit mit dem gel\u00f6sten CO2. Es entsteht Kalziumkarbonat - Kalk. \"Das CO2 wird in fester Form und damit langfristig gespeichert\", sagt PIK-Expertin Strefler.

Dabei wird das CO2 dann wieder frei.</p><p>Dieses soll bei der Methode namens BECCS, kurz f\u00fcr \"Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage\", eingefangen und auch im Untergrund gespeichert werden. Das vom gr\u00fcnen Politiker Robert Habeck gef\u00fchrte Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz schreibt auf seiner</p><p>Homepage: \"Zu ber\u00fccksichtigen ist jedoch, dass nachhaltig erzeugte Biomasse nur im begrenzten Umfang verf\u00fcgbar ist.\" Es wird nur ein Baustein von vielen sein. Bleibt die entscheidende Frage: K\u00f6nnte Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt solche Verfahren anwenden, gibt es CO2-Speicher?</p><p>5. Platz f\u00fcr CO2 unter dem Meer</p><p>Die unterirdische Speicherung von CO2 war in Deutschland lange Zeit umstritten. Das bisher einzige CO2-Speicherprojekt in Deutschland befindet sich westlich von Berlin in Ketzin. Das sei in anderen L\u00e4ndern anders, hei\u00dft es auf der Ministeriums-Homepage: \"Die geologische Speicherung von CO2 wird weltweit seit Jahrzehnten praktiziert - von kleinen Pilot- bis hin zu gro\u00dfen Industrieprojekten und unter verschiedenen geologischen Rahmenbedingungen.\" Gro\u00dfe Speicher l\u00e4gen zum Beispiel unter der Nordsee. D\u00e4nemark hat Anfang M\u00e4rz mit der Einlagerung von CO2 in einem fr\u00fcheren \u00d6lfeld unter seinem Teil der Nordsee bereits begonnen. Bei anderen Varianten l\u00e4sst sich CO2 aber auch nutzen.</p><p>6. Industrie braucht CO2 als Rohstoff</p><p>Der Leverkusener Chemiekonzern Covestro zum Beispiel setzt CO2 bei der Kunststoffproduktion ein. Der Begriff daf\u00fcr: Carbon Capture and Utilization, CCU. Das Unternehmen verwendet das Treibhausgas als alternativen Rohstoff f\u00fcr die Herstellung von Polycarbonat, das zum Beispiel in Autokarosserien, medizinischen Ger\u00e4ten, Stadiond\u00e4chern stecken kann. Auch f\u00fcr den Schaumstoff etwa von Matratzen oder Polsterm\u00f6beln wird CO2 genutzt, genauer zur Produktion der chemischen Vorprodukte, die gebraucht werden um Polyurethane f\u00fcr Schaumstoff herzustellen. Die Chemie wird neu erfunden, auch von anderen Firmen. Carbonfasern zum Beispiel lassen sich auch aus CO2 herstellen. Allerdings wird das CO2 am Ende des Matratzenlebens wieder freigesetzt, wenn sie verbrannt werden.</p><p>7. Noch hat die Technik Grenzen</p><p>\"Es gibt nicht die eine, die beste Option. Wir m\u00fcssen jede angucken\", sagt Jan Christoph Minx, der am Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change zum Stand der Techniken forscht. Er hat erst Anfang des Jahres zusammen mit einem internationalen Wissenschaftsteam eine \"Bestandsaufnahme\" gemacht. Demnach werden die technischen Methoden noch viel zu wenig vorangetrieben. Bisher w\u00fcrden sie j\u00e4hrlich gerade mal 0,002 Gigatonnen CO2 aus der Atmosph\u00e4re nehmen. Um die Klimaziele zu erreichen, m\u00fcssten das schon 2050 1300 Mal mehr sein.</p><p>8. Entspannen ist keine Option</p><p>Die Potsdamer Klimaforscherin Strefler z\u00e4hlt noch zwei weitere Methoden auf. Pflanzenreste k\u00f6nnten verkohlt und diese Biokohle dann auf den B\u00f6den ausgebracht werden. Der in den Pflanzen enthaltene Kohlenstoff bleibe so im Boden, verbessere obendrein dessen Eigenschaften. Auch die beschleunigte Verwitterung sei eine Variante: Basalt oder Kalkgestein binden Kohlendioxid, wenn sie verwittern.</p><p>Zermahlt man die Gesteine, wird die Oberfl\u00e4che gr\u00f6\u00dfer und die Verwitterung schneller. K\u00f6nnte man sich dann bei der Minderung der Treibhausgase entspannen? \"Auf keinen Fall\", erkl\u00e4rt Strefler, \"mit keiner der Techniken l\u00e4sst sich beliebig viel CO2 wieder einfangen, es gibt immer Grenzen, weil zum Beispiel zu viel Energie n\u00f6tig w\u00e4re oder eine zu gro\u00dfe Landfl\u00e4che.\"</p><p>Und je nach Verfahren sei es auch mal mehr, mal weniger teuer. Expertin Strefler sagt es so: \"Jede Tonne CO2, die wir gar nicht erst aussto\u00dfen, m\u00fcssen wir auch nicht aufwendig wieder zur\u00fcckholen.\"</p>", "publisher": "Lampertheimer Zeitung", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 87, "title": "Die CO2-R\u00fcckholaktion", "published": "2023-04-21", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERLIN.

So eine Art Staubsauger f\u00fcr die Luft, um der Atmosph\u00e4re CO2 zu entziehen, sie aufzur\u00e4umen - kann das funktionieren? Es muss, will die Menschheit ihr selbst gestecktes Klimaziel von m\u00f6glichst maximal 1,5 Grad Erderhitzung erreichen. Da sind sich Expertinnen und Experten einig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zuletzt hat das auch der Weltklimarat klargemacht. Was sich schon tut und tun muss - eine Erkl\u00e4rung in acht Schritten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. B\u00e4ume pflanzen allein hilft nicht</p><p>Es gibt die nat\u00fcrlichen Wege. Erstens: die Aufforstung. B\u00e4ume nehmen w\u00e4hrend ihres Wachstums CO2 auf. Das Holz speichert Kohlenstoff. Zweitens: Aufbau von Humusschichten im Boden. Auch Humus bunkert Treibhausgase. Das h\u00f6rt sich alles gut an. Die Experten sprechen von \"nature based solutions\". Diese Natur basierten L\u00f6sungen haben aber einen Haken: \"Es ist unklar, wie viel CO2 langfristig gespeichert bleibt\", sagt Jessica Strefler vom Potsdam-Institut f\u00fcr Klimafolgenforschung, PIK. Sie erforscht, welche Rolle Technologien zur Entfernung von Kohlendioxid, dem Carbon Dioxid Removal, kurz CDR, f\u00fcr den Klimaschutz spielen k\u00f6nnen. D\u00fcrren, St\u00fcrme, Borkenk\u00e4fer k\u00f6nnen ganze Waldbest\u00e4nde zusammenbrechen und das CO2 in der Folge wieder frei werden lassen. Auch der Humusaufbau ist umkehrbar - der Kohlenstoff kann jederzeit wieder als CO2 in die Luft entweichen, \u00e4ndert der Landwirt die Bewirtschaftung des Bodens. Bringt das also alles gar nichts? \"Nein, solche L\u00f6sungen werden gebraucht, sie sind nicht teuer, tendenziell auch gut f\u00fcr den Boden\", sagt Strefler, \"sie reichen nur nicht.\" Gefragt ist neue Technik.</p><p>2. CO2-F\u00e4nger sind keine Science-Fiction</p><p>Kann man Algen im Meer mit Eisensulfat d\u00fcngen, sodass diese st\u00e4rker wachsen und der Atmosph\u00e4re gef\u00e4hrliches Treibhausgas entziehen?

Von Marie Lassegnore, CFA, Head of Sustainable Investments, La Fran\u00e7aise AM Die COP27 ist vorbei. Offene und ungel\u00f6ste Klimaprobleme haben offensichtlich die erfreulichen Fortschritte \u00fcberschattet.\u00a0 Ein Ziel der COP27 war, die Ambitionen beim Klimaschutz zu bekr\u00e4ftigen und zu steigern. Bedauerlicherweise taten dies nur 29 L\u00e4nder. Das Arbeitsprogramm zur Eind\u00e4mmung des Klimawandels, mit dem Ziel die Begrenzung der Erderw\u00e4rmung auf 1,5\u00b0C beizubehalten, steht unter Druck. Die Marke k\u00f6nnte bereits 2026 \u00fcberschritten werden. Wie geht es also danach weiter? Diese Frage muss erst noch beantwortet werden. Eine Versch\u00e4rfung der globalen Ma\u00dfnahmen zum Kohleausstieg wurde nicht in Aussicht gestellt. Indonesien, dem weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dften Kohleexporteur und drittgr\u00f6\u00dften Kohleverbraucher, wurde jedoch eine Finanzierungszusage in H\u00f6he von 20Millarden US-Dollar gemacht. Damit kann das Land seinen gerechten \u00dcbergang finanzieren, seine Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von der Kohle verringern und folglich seine Spitzenemissionen im Jahr 2030 senken und sie bis 2050 wieder auf Netto-Null bringen. Erfreulicherweise wurde die COP27 um fast zwei Tage verl\u00e4ngert, um eine Einigung \u00fcber ?Loss and Damage?, d. h. die durch den Klimawandel verursachten dauerhaften oder reversiblen Sch\u00e4den, zu erzielen. Auch hier blieben die tats\u00e4chlichen Fortschritte hinter den Erwartungen zur\u00fcck. Es wurde zwar beschlossen, einen ?Loss and Damage?-Fonds f\u00fcr gef\u00e4hrdete L\u00e4nder einzurichten, jedoch ohne einen Beschluss \u00fcber die tats\u00e4chliche Finanzierung. Au\u00dferdem bleibt die Definition der f\u00f6rderf\u00e4higen L\u00e4nder vage: ?Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder, die besonders anf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr die negativen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels sind?. Auch die Anpassung an den Klimawandel stand ganz oben auf der Tagesordnung, insbesondere angesichts der geografischen Lage des Gastgeberlandes \u00c4gypten. Es wurde zwar viel diskutiert, aber das Ziel, die Mittel f\u00fcr die Anpassung an den Klimawandel ?mindestens zu verdoppeln?, wurde nicht wirklich erreicht. Allerdings hat sich der Ausschuss ?Global Goal on Adaptation? auf einen Themenkatalog geeinigt, die in vier Workshops behandelt werden sollen. Er wird voraussichtlich im n\u00e4chsten Jahr seinen Bericht vorlegen. Die Klimafinanzierung durch die Industriel\u00e4nder blieb erneut hinter dem Ziel von 100 Milliarden US-Dollar pro Jahr zur\u00fcck! Gleichzeitig kommt das neue Klimafinanzierungsziel (New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, NCQG) nur langsam voran (eine Entscheidung wird bis 2024 erwartet). Auf der COP27 wurde ein zentrales Thema der Klimafinanzierung angesprochen: die Herkunft und Form der Instrumente. Vorgeschlagen wurde, Zusch\u00fcsse gegen\u00fcber Darlehen zu bevorzugen, um eine \u00dcberschuldung der Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder zu vermeiden, die entschlossen sind, ihre strukturellen Schwachstellen zu beseitigen. Besonders hervorzuheben sind die operativen und praktischen Fortschritte beim Santiago Network for Loss and Damage (technische Hilfe f\u00fcr Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder, die durch die negativen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels gef\u00e4hrdet sind). Die Governance-Struktur wurde festgelegt, und es werden (zus\u00e4tzlich zu den Spenden) finanzielle Mittel f\u00fcr den Aufbau bereitgestellt. Die Gespr\u00e4che \u00fcber Artikel 6 des Pariser Abkommens (erlaubt den L\u00e4ndern bei der Erreichung von Emissionsreduktionszielen zusammenzuarbeiten, d. h. Emissionszertifikate auszutauschen) sind zwar vorangekommen, aber die Schl\u00fcsselfrage der Anrechenbarkeit von ?Emissionsvermeidung? als Emissionszertifikate wurde auf n\u00e4chstes Jahr verschoben. Die multilaterale Zusammenarbeit, ein zentrales Anliegen im Vorfeld der COP27, ist noch nicht vollst\u00e4ndig geregelt. Es besteht ein klarer Bruch zwischen ?entwickelten? und ?Entwicklungsl\u00e4ndern? aufgrund der \u00fcberholten Definition (die aus dem Jahr 1992 stammt) und der impliziten Festlegung, wer zu zahlen und wer zu profitieren hat. China scheint im Zentrum dieser Kluft zu stehen. Dies wird durch den Vorschlag der EU deutlich, in den Loss-and-Damage-Fonds einzuzahlen, unter der Bedingung, dass China ebenfalls einen Beitrag leistet. Die Klimagespr\u00e4che zwischen den USA und China sind offenbar wieder aufgenommen worden (Joe Biden und Xi Jinping vereinbarten auf dem G20-Gipfel, die Zusammenarbeit beim Klimawandel fortzusetzen, w\u00e4hrend sich ihre Sonderbeauftragten auf der COP27 hinter verschlossenen T\u00fcren trafen). Dies gibt Anlass zur Hoffnung. Positiv zu erw\u00e4hnen ist, dass es eine Vielzahl neuer Initiativen und Partnerschaften gab. Hier einige der bemerkenswertesten: Globaler Schutzschirm gegen Klimarisiken: Wurde von der V20 und G7 ins Leben gerufen  Bridgetown-Initiative der Premierministerin von Barbados, Mia Mottley  Brasilien, Kongo und Indonesien, die Heimat der gr\u00f6\u00dften Regenw\u00e4lder, haben eine Partnerschaft zum Schutz ihrer W\u00e4lder und zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Entwaldung ins Leben gerufen  Initiative afrikanischer Staats- und Regierungschefs zur Schaffung von 300 Millionen Emissionszertifikaten und 6 Milliarden US-Dollar Einnahmen j\u00e4hrlich bis 2030  ENACT-Initiative (Enhancing Nature-based Solutions for an Accelerated Climate Transformation) wurde ins Leben gerufen. Sie soll die globalen Bem\u00fchungen zur Klimawandelbek\u00e4mpfung, der Land- und \u00d6kosystemdegradation und des Verlusts der biologischen Vielfalt durch naturbasierte L\u00f6sungen koordinieren  Global Methane Pledge hat zwei neue Initiativen ins Leben gerufen, um die Methanreduzierung in der Landwirtschaft und im Abfallsektor voranzutreiben (die Zahl der Unterzeichner hat 150 erreicht, von denen 50 bereits Methan-Aktionspl\u00e4ne aufgestellt haben oder gerade entwickeln). Die Maxime ?Alleine schneller, gemeinsam weiter? bekommt eine neue Bedeutung. Mehr denn je ist deutlich geworden, dass die Zeit dr\u00e4ngt. Wir k\u00f6nnen nicht auf einen bahnbrechenden multilateralen Fortschritt warten. Die L\u00e4nder und ihre Bev\u00f6lkerungen m\u00fcssen dringend eigene Ma\u00dfnahmen ergreifen. Anschlie\u00dfend k\u00f6nnen wir gemeinsam die politischen H\u00fcrden \u00fcberwinden.

It is<br/>dissolved in water and pumped deep underground, where it reacts naturally<br/>with the surrounding basalt rock to form stable carbonate minerals - the CO2<br/>literally turns into stone. This is considered the safest, most durable form<br/>of all carbon removal solutions that are commercially available today.</p><p>At a price point of several hundred dollars per tonne of CO2 removed, it is<br/>at present also one of the costliest options. Larger, more economical<br/>air-capture and storage facilities can only be realised if customers are<br/>committed to long-term purchasing agreements. They guarantee a future<br/>revenue stream to the developers, making new projects fundable.</p><p>Christoph Gebald, co-CEO and co-founder of Climeworks, said: 'We are very<br/>proud to have established the basis for a unique long-term partnership with<br/>the leading risk knowledge company Swiss Re. This is a decisive milestone<br/>for the scale-up of Climeworks and the direct air capture industry.'</p><p>Carbon removal projects can use nature-based solutions like afforestation,<br/>which comes with many co-benefits, such as improved biodiversity. They are,<br/>however, limited by other types of land use and are vulnerable to the<br/>re-release of the stored carbon, eg through wildfires. This is why<br/>technological carbon removal solutions like direct air capture and storage<br/>are necessary to limit global warming over the long run.</p><p>Bringing climate solutions to scale not only requires the right demand<br/>signals, but also de-risking and financing. The insurance sector is uniquely<br/>positioned to offer support on all three fronts: through long-term purchase<br/>agreements, providing insurance capacity for evolving risk pools, and<br/>investments in new asset classes, as described in the recent Swiss Re<br/>Institute report on the insurance rationale for carbon removal solutions.</p><p>Swiss Re has committed to achieve net-zero emissions in its insurance and<br/>investment business by 2050, and in its own operations already by 2030,<br/>following its 'Do our best, remove the rest' approach that aims to first of<br/>all reduce emissions as much as possible before balancing any residual<br/>emissions through carbon removal.</p><p>Swiss Re<br/>The Swiss Re Group is one of the world's leading providers of reinsurance,<br/>insurance and other forms of insurance-based risk transfer, working to make<br/>the world more resilient. It anticipates and manages risk - from natural<br/>catastrophes to climate change, from ageing populations to cyber crime. The<br/>aim of the Swiss Re Group is to enable society to thrive and progress,<br/>creating new opportunities and solutions for its clients. Headquartered in<br/>Zurich, Switzerland, where it was founded in 1863, the Swiss Re Group<br/>operates through a network of around 80 offices globally.</p><p>Climeworks<br/>Climeworks empowers people to reverse climate change by permanently removing<br/>carbon dioxide from the air. One of two things happens to the Climeworks<br/>air-captured carbon dioxide: either it is returned to earth, stored safely<br/>and permanently away for millions of years, or it is upcycled into<br/>climate-friendly products such as carbon-neutral fuels and materials. The<br/>Climeworks direct air capture technology runs exclusively on clean energy,<br/>and the modular CO2 collectors can be stacked to build machines of any size.<br/>Founded by engineers Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher, Climeworks strives<br/>to inspire 1 billion people to act now and remove carbon dioxide from the<br/>air.

Sollte in Deutschland das Bruttoinlandsprodukt um zehn Prozent zur\u00fcckgehen, k\u00f6nnten die CO2-Emissionen in diesem Jahr um einige Prozent sinken. Ich sch\u00e4tze die Folgen der Krise allerdings so ein, dass wir auch in den Folgejahren Reduktionen sehen werden, und zwar im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu der Lage, die sich bei uns ohne Corona ergeben h\u00e4tte. Diese Krise wird insofern auch langfristige Ver\u00e4nderungen nach sich ziehen. Viel wichtiger f\u00fcr das Klima wird aber ein weiterer Punkt werden. Die Krise kann in den \u00e4rmeren L\u00e4ndern mit hohen Populationen noch dramatische Auswirkungen haben. Das kann diese L\u00e4nder um ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zur\u00fcckwerfen. Das ist angesichts der Armutsverh\u00e4ltnisse kaum ertr\u00e4glich und hat den Charakter einer gro\u00dfen Ungerechtigkeit. Aber f\u00fcr Gerechtigkeitsfragen interessiert sich das Klima nicht.</p><p>Auf den zweiten Blick muss man bef\u00fcrchten, dass der Klimaschutz Corona zum Opfer f\u00e4llt. Firmen und Privatpersonen haben vielleicht andere Sorgen, als ihre selbst gesteckten Klimaziele einzuhalten.</p><p>Ich verstehe Ihre Frage so, dass viele privatwirtschaftliche Akteure weniger als bisher bereit sein werden, sich \u00fcber gesetzliche Vorgaben hinaus im Klimabereich zu engagieren. Das halte ich f\u00fcr plausibel. Allerdings haben wir stattdessen die anderen f\u00fcr das Klima g\u00fcnstigen Entwicklungen, die oben bereits besprochen wurden. Insgesamt kann das f\u00fcr das Klima eine bessere Situation sein als ohne Krise.</p><p>In der EU fordern aktuell Wirtschaftsverb\u00e4nde und Politiker, den Green Deal auszusetzen. Also den ehrgeizigen Plan, den CO2-Aussto\u00df bis 2030 nicht nur um 40, sondern um 55 Prozent zu reduzieren.</p><p>Im Green Deal geht es nicht nur um den CO2-Aussto\u00df. Es soll auch um mehr Wohlstand, Innovationsf\u00fchrerschaft, Nachhaltigkeit im Allgemeinen gehen. Die Vorstellungen hinter dem Green Deal sind aus meiner Sicht allerdings nicht realistisch. So, wie er angelegt ist, wird er Europa \u00e4rmer machen. Corona kommt jetzt hinzu. Wir haben schon eine teure, Elektroautos favorisierende EU-Regelung. Das funktioniert ohnehin nicht. Jetzt trifft die Corona-Krise die Automobilindustrie ein weiteres Mal. Wir m\u00fcssen vieles in unseren Pl\u00e4nen ver\u00e4ndern, wenn Europa gute Zukunftsaussichten haben soll. Darauf zielen die Forderungen.</p><p>Es werden nicht nur Klimaziele verfehlt, vermutlich werden auch deutlich weniger ihren CO2-Fu\u00dfabdruck kompensieren. F\u00fcrchten Sie um die Allianz f\u00fcr Entwicklung und Klima?</p><p>In europ\u00e4ischer Betrachtung verfehlen wir unsere Klimaziele nicht. In Verbindung mit Corona halten wir vielleicht sogar die deutschen Klimaziele, nicht nur als Teil Europas. Die freiwilligen Aktivit\u00e4ten kommen additiv dazu. Vielleicht werden es gar nicht weniger, sondern mehr, weil leistungsstarke Akteure verstehen, dass es beim Klimathema um ihre eigene Zukunft geht und sie relativ preiswert viel bewegen k\u00f6nnen. Ich erinnere hier an die Beispiele Bosch und Microsoft.</p><p>Ungeachtet schlimmer Krankheitsverl\u00e4ufe und vielen Toten begr\u00fc\u00dfen manche Menschen den Nebeneffekt, dass das gesellschaftliche Rad etwas langsamer l\u00e4uft.</p><p>Es ist ja nicht \u00fcberraschend, dass sich das viele Menschen schon lange w\u00fcnschen. F\u00fcr viele Menschen bedeutet das moderne Leben Stress. Nicht ohne Grund thematisieren manche die Work Life Balance. Manche haben sich schon immer gew\u00fcnscht, einen Teil ihrer Arbeit im Homeoffice erledigen zu k\u00f6nnen, anderen haben sich gew\u00fcnscht, statt Dienstreisen lieber Telekonferenzen durchzuf\u00fchren. Manche freuen sich, dass sie im Homeoffice mehr Zeit mit ihren Kindern verbringen k\u00f6nnen, auch wenn andere mit dieser Situation kaum fertig werden. Und wieder andere haben endlich Zeit f\u00fcr ihren Garten und machen Urlaub zuhause. Die Frage ist zum Schluss, wof\u00fcr sich die Gesamtgesellschaft entscheidet, dies wiederum auch in Konkurrenz zu anderen Gesellschaften oder auch zu anderen Akteuren. Dies dann unter den rechtlichen Gegebenheiten, die bestimmen, was weltweit in den M\u00e4rkten erlaubt ist und was nicht.</p><p>Kann man dem Shutdown auch etwas Positives abgewinnen?</p><p>Einiges, was man als positiv werten kann, habe ich schon erw\u00e4hnt. Das sind alles sehr individuelle Themen. F\u00fcr mich positiv sind insbesondere Erkenntnisse, die man aus der aktuellen Krise ziehen kann und sollte, etwa die Erfahrungen mit der Fragilit\u00e4t internationaler Vereinbarungen und selbst von EU-Vertr\u00e4gen und Prinzipien. Ganz offensichtlich reichen Krisen \u00fcberschaubarer Dimension, um supranationale Strukturen zumindest tempor\u00e4r au\u00dfer Kraft zu setzen. In der Krise fallen wir sehr schnell auf die Nation zur\u00fcck. Wer sich supranational organisiert hat, bekommt sehr schnell Probleme. Teilweise beobachten wir solche Tendenzen in der Bundesrepublik sogar auf der Ebenen der Bundesl\u00e4nder, wenn beispielsweise in Ulm Gesch\u00e4fte \u00f6ffnen d\u00fcrfen, in Neu-Ulm aber nicht.</p><p>In jeder Krise liegt auch eine Chance: Was f\u00fcr Lehren k\u00f6nnen klimatechnisch aus der jetzigen Situation gezogen werden?</p><p>Ich glaube, dass wir aus der Krise viel lernen k\u00f6nnen. Wahrscheinlich gibt es ein paar kluge Impulse f\u00fcr die Weiterentwicklung auf der Welthandelsebene und in Europa. Wir werden wahrscheinlich dem internationalen Marktgeschehen Vorkehrungen f\u00fcr Notfallsituationen mit dem Ziel einer Erh\u00f6hung der Resilienz regulativ aufzwingen, so wie das heute schon bei Sicherheitsthemen, Gesundheitsfragen und meist auch im Energiebereich der Fall ist. Die Bereiche, in denen alleine der Preis die Durchsetzungsmacht im Markt bestimmt, werden eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. Klimatechnisch ist nicht so viel zu lernen. Man sieht, was wir ohnehin wissen, n\u00e4mlich, dass weniger Wohlstand und weniger Aktivit\u00e4ten weniger CO2-Emissionen bedeuten. Ich glaube nicht, dass sich die meisten Menschen nach der Krise f\u00fcr ein Leben mit weniger Aktivit\u00e4t als vor der Krise entscheiden werden, wenn sie nicht aus finanziellen Gr\u00fcnden dazu gezwungen werden. Klimatechnisch viel wichtiger ist ohnehin die sich wahrscheinlich fortsetzende Armut in gro\u00dfen Entwicklungs- und Schwellenl\u00e4ndern. Auch das ist nichts, was sich jemand w\u00fcnschen w\u00fcrde oder jemand freiwillig akzeptieren w\u00fcrde. Die Krise ist da grausam und zwingt sich den Menschen als Realit\u00e4t auf.</p><p>Muss man bef\u00fcrchten, dass nach dem Ende der Pandemie alles wieder so l\u00e4uft wie zuvor? Oder gibt es Anzeichen eines Umdenkens bei den Menschen?</p><p>Wenn Sie das Wort bef\u00fcrchten benutzen, hat man den Eindruck, dass vorher alles schlecht war und es eines Umdenkens bedarf. Das ist nicht meine Sicht auf die Gesamtsituation. Das gilt auch f\u00fcr das Bild des Umdenkens, mit dem oft die Idee eines einfacheren und bescheideneren Lebensstils verbunden wird. Was wir aus meiner Sicht stattdessen im Klimabereich ben\u00f6tigen, sind deutlich st\u00e4rkere Anstrengungen f\u00fcr technische Innovationen, insbesondere in den Bereichen nature-based solutions und synthetische Kraftstoffe. Ich hoffe, dass kluge Regierungen und kluge Investoren an diesen Stellen gro\u00dfe Aktivit\u00e4ten entfalten werden. Das alles ist relativ unabh\u00e4ngig von der Corona-Thematik.</p><p>In Deutschland herrscht weit verbreitet der Glaube vor, Vorreiter in Sachen Klimaschutz zu sein. Teilen Sie diese Einstellung?</p><p>Es gibt viele Menschen in Deutschland, die tats\u00e4chlich glauben, wir seien die \u201eGuten\u201c und von uns k\u00f6nne die Welt noch viel lernen. Diese Leute glauben in der Regel auch, dass wir der Welt am besten dadurch helfen, dass wir uns fast ausschlie\u00dflich in Deutschland engagieren. Aus meiner Sicht ist das alles realit\u00e4tsfern. Wir haben in Deutschland pro Kopf doppelt so viele CO2-Emissionen wie die Menschen in Frankreich. Wir haben au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich hohe Stromtarife. Die Entscheidungen \u00fcber das Klima fallen in Afrika in Indien und in S\u00fcdostasien, nicht bei uns. Deshalb sollten wir uns insbesondere dort engagieren \u2013 zum Beispiel in der Logik der Allianz f\u00fcr Entwicklung und Klima des Bundesministeriums f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung. Gegen ein internationales Engagement gibt es aber gro\u00dfe Widerst\u00e4nde. F\u00fcr viele ist das Klimathema vor allem der Hebel, um Finanzierung f\u00fcr gr\u00fcne Projekte vor Ort zu sichern.</p><p>Zugespitzt gesagt, k\u00f6nnten die Menschen vor dem Hintergrund des Gesagten ihre Bem\u00fchungen einstellen, klimafreundlich zu sein. Das kann aber nicht wirklich Ihre Absicht sein, oder?</p><p>Nein! Die Menschen sollen sich engagieren und daf\u00fcr auch ihr Geld einsetzen. Zum Beispiel f\u00fcr eine weitere W\u00e4rmepumpe in Deutschland oder f\u00fcr Regenwaldschutz in Indonesien. Ich halte in vielen F\u00e4llen den Regenwaldschutz f\u00fcr die bessere L\u00f6sung. Ansonsten ist mir wichtig, dass jemand der vegan lebt oder nur noch Fahrrad f\u00e4hrt, dann dem Klima nicht hilft, wenn er dadurch viel Geld einspart und dieses als Verm\u00f6gen f\u00fcr die Zukunft anspart. Denn das Geld wird dann \u00fcber das Finanzsystem und Kredite an anderer Stelle Umweltbelastungen erzeugen. Das ist dann nur ein Verschiebebahnhof. Wenn das eingesparte Geld aber als verlorener Zuschuss in sinnvolle Projekte in Afrika flie\u00dft, n\u00fctzt das dem Klima und der Menschheit insgesamt.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"IRB-Z2D4T\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"16548\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"IRB-YP8QL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"16548\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"IRB-URKP4\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"16548\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20200504_ulloka02c_0405_01116826831\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"16548\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"IRA-65519595\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"16548\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p>", "publisher": "S\u00fcdwest Presse", "instances": ["Das ist nicht meine Sicht auf die Gesamtsituation.

It is a goal that is firmly grounded in scientific evidence. We have already proposed to apply it for the European Union in our 2030 Biodiversity Strategy. I also call on all government and business leaders to significantly step up investments in nature and biodiversity. The 30% target backed up by strong financial support for nature is at the same time an environmental imperative and a great opportunity to improve our health and help our economies transition to a sustainable economy...

(\"Nouveau Monde\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: NOU; OTCQX: NMGRD;<br/>Frankfurt: NM9) to become carbon-neutral. Nouveau Monde's mission is to<br/>\"produce the greenest advanced graphite materials with a carbon-neutral<br/>footprint for a sustainable world\" and the Company is continuously striving<br/>for excellence in minimizing Greenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") emissions and climate<br/>impact. A key piece of this GHG-mitigating ambition is the development of<br/>100% renewable electric mining operations on its Matawinie Mine in<br/>Saint-Michel-des-Saints. When operational, this will result in 82% less<br/>direct GHG emissions from mining. To accelerate its deployment, Nouveau<br/>Monde is collaborating to develop electric systems and infrastructure for<br/>heavy vehicles to be used in open-pit mining. Moreover, the use of<br/>hydroelectricity as the exclusive energy source significantly reduces the<br/>future carbon footprint of Nouveau Monde's battery material.</p><p>In short, through our actions today, we are executing our Mission and<br/>driving the transition to a green future.</p><p>Arne H Frandsen, Chairman of Nouveau Monde, stated: \"Nouveau Monde has<br/>committed to a Zero Harm approach to producing advanced battery materials<br/>for decades to come. Carbon neutrality is an important part of this<br/>commitment. We know that for many of our potential global clients, being<br/>able to purchase North American produced, high-quality carbon-neutral<br/>battery anode material, is of great importance. Nouveau Monde is determined<br/>to establish itself as one of the world's largest and most important sources<br/>of anode material for Lithium-Ion batteries. Nouveau Monde intends to become<br/>the Western World's first vertically-integrated, carbon-neutral anode<br/>materials producer of scale, coming to market during 2023 with our Matawinie<br/>graphite products.\"</p><p>Eric Desaulniers, President and CEO of Nouveau Monde, continued: \"With<br/>approvals and the ministerial decree now in hand, it is time to deploy<br/>resources to put our vision of producing the cleanest and greenest<br/>graphite-based products possible, into concrete, measurable actions. Our<br/>Phase 1 anode materials plant at B\u00e9cancour is being build and work on our<br/>Matawinie Mine is ongoing. While building the carbon-neutral mining and<br/>battery anode material producer of the future, based in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, we<br/>are protecting our ecosystem and creating a legacy that will positively<br/>impact our communities, or clients, and the world at large.\"</p><p>To meet its carbon-neutral objectives, Nouveau Monde has entered into<br/>partnership with NEL-i, a Qu\u00e9bec-based firm with expertise in climate action<br/>and GHG management solutions, to focus on three main initiatives, which<br/>represent the cornerstones of Nouveau Monde's Climate Action Plan (\"CAP\")<br/>and carbon-neutrality targets. These initiatives are outlined below and<br/>represent the path by which Nouveau Monde is now embarking to secure past,<br/>present and future \"carbon-neutral status\".</p><p>1. Carbon-neutrality of historical activities</p><p>Nouveau Monde takes responsibility for its entire organisational GHG<br/>footprint  from its time of inception in 2012  and will promptly act to<br/>neutralize its climate impact. From prospecting activities to operating the<br/>demonstration concentrator plant, the Company has calculated and reported<br/>GHG emissions from all direct emission sources (scope 1), indirect emissions<br/>from energy usage (scope 2) and indirect emissions (scope 3) for which the<br/>Company was responsible in the pre-commercial phase.</p><p>Cumulative historical GHG emissions since the founding of the Company and up<br/>to December 31, 2020 are 2,151 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (\"t CO2 e\")<br/>(excluding changes in forest carbon stocks - the emissions from this<br/>important activity will be quantified and the offsetting will be included in<br/>the next phases set out below).</p><p>To do this, all historical emissions will be offset by verified emission<br/>reductions (\"VER\"), commonly referred to as \"carbon credits\", from certified<br/>Qu\u00e9bec projects that comply with best offset practices.</p><p>The supported projects are registered projects on the CSA Clean Projects<br/>Registry. They meet additionality and best practices criteria as per ISO<br/>14064-2 standards and are third-party verified as per ISO 14064-3. Supported<br/>by the experts at NEL-i, Nouveau Monde has assembled a diversified portfolio<br/>of GHG offset units from various GHG-reducing activities including:</p><p>- landfill gas capture and combustion with energy recovery;</p><p>- production of renewable energy from residual forest biomass;</p><p>- change in fuel selection, from fossils to bioenergy; and</p><p>- energy conservation.</p><p>Organizations that have developed these projects and benefited from this<br/>initiative include school boards of the Montr\u00e9al metropolitan area, Qu\u00e9bec<br/>greenhouse growers and renewable energy producers.</p><p>Nouveau Monde expects that its carbon-neutral status will be official during<br/>April 2021 once the carbon credits are officially registered in the CSA<br/>Clean Projects Registry.</p><p>2. Development of the Nouveau Monde's Climate Action Plan and offsetting<br/>projects</p><p>The Climate Action Plan (\"CAP\"), is a stakeholder engagement tool par<br/>excellence, for both internal and external use by organizations whose<br/>business strategy is linked to the potentiality of climate impacts. It<br/>allows the disclosure of reduction efforts, objectives and results of<br/>various initiatives, in addition to serving as a reference and guide for<br/>decision-making regarding the carbon footprint of the Company and its<br/>products.</p><p>The unique nature of Nouveau Monde's operations - underpinned by Qu\u00e9bec's<br/>renewable hydroelectricity - positions the Company to have a significantly<br/>lower carbon footprint versus other operations globally. For the GHG<br/>emissions that Nouveau Monde will emit, the Company is embarking on a<br/>comprehensive CAP, in line with its Vision and Mission.</p><p>As part of its CAP, Nouveau Monde is completing a monitoring plan comprised<br/>of the effective ongoing recording of GHG-related data and will be the basis<br/>for accurate GHG quantification and reporting. The organisational GHG<br/>inventory is structured to incorporate emissions at the mine in<br/>Saint-Michel-des-Saints and at the value-added LiB Anode Materials Plant in<br/>B\u00e9cancour. All sources of direct emissions (scope 1) and indirect emissions<br/>(scope 3) occurring on-site during the site-preparation and construction<br/>phase, the operation and the decommissioning, as well as the indirect<br/>emissions from energy usage (scope 2) are incorporated into the Company's<br/>assessment. The fraction of forest carbon that is transferred to the<br/>atmosphere from necessary tree removal is also accounted for, reported<br/>separately, and will also be compensated.</p><p>All of these emissions will be accounted for, transparently reported and<br/>subject to offsetting on a yearly basis. Due to the Company's low GHG<br/>emissions  less than 25,000 t CO2 e/year is expected  Nouveau Monde's<br/>projects are not subject to the Cap and Trade regulation between Qu\u00e9bec and<br/>California.</p><p>Nature-based carbon sequestration projects will be identified by Nouveau<br/>Monde, with the help of NEL-i to define them and identify their scope of<br/>applicability, analyze their profitability (carbon impact), and then develop<br/>them. Nouveau Monde is also planning to invest in the research and<br/>development of effective carbon mineral storage solutions, through a<br/>\"circular economy\" approach - that is, the recycling of industrial mineral<br/>residues that are prone to carbonate and that could be used on-site for the<br/>management of tailings.</p><p>Nouveau Monde will be the developer of these projects and thereby take<br/>leadership and ultimate responsibility; as its partner, NEL-i will ensure<br/>project conformity to recognized compensation mechanisms (and carbon<br/>markets).</p><p>3. Partnership in Qu\u00e9bec-wide conservation project and restoration of<br/>affected land</p><p>Nouveau Monde is committed to playing an active role in the development of<br/>innovative initiatives to reduce or remove GHG from the atmosphere and<br/>counterbalance a part of its own GHG emissions. The Company is actively<br/>working on the creation of nature reserves and the development of land-based<br/>carbon sequestration projects. In doing so, Nouveau Monde reinforces a<br/>statement of trust in nature-based solutions to effectively achieve net-zero<br/>GHG emissions and recognizes the inherent value of our environment and all<br/>the social, cultural, economic and environmental co-benefits of healthy<br/>ecosystems for our communities.</p><p>NEL-i is developing the first large-scale forest carbon stock enhancement<br/>project in Qu\u00e9bec. This project incorporates initiatives for conservation,<br/>improvement of harvesting and reforestation practices across Qu\u00e9bec. It<br/>involves small and large forest landowners in addition to regional<br/>conservation organizations that seek to maintain and enhance ecosystems by<br/>monetizing their potential for increased sequestration.</p><p>As part of this project, a reinvestment will be evaluated to restore<br/>degraded lands in tropical areas in the Caribbean. The goal is to be able to<br/>restore and put back into sustainable production one hectare of land for<br/>each hectare of land conserved in Qu\u00e9bec. It is an initiative which<br/>maximizes the impact of each dollar invested in the project by focusing on<br/>the natural mechanisms of increased carbon sequestration by photosynthesis<br/>in tropical zones.</p><p>With an initial commitment of $50,000, Nouveau Monde will be the project's<br/>first industrial partner. This amount will be used to conduct the<br/>technico-economic feasibility study and the preliminary design phase to be<br/>completed during Fall 2021. According to the results of the study, Nouveau<br/>Monde will make an evaluation to invest an additional $200,000 over 2 years<br/>for the commissioning of the project. Such an investment will allow Nouveau<br/>Monde to have a secure supply of carbon credits from this major offsetting<br/>project at a favorable rate - that is, at the production cost.</p><p>The United Nations Climate Change Convention on the Paris Agreement - The<br/>Framework Surrounding Environmental Responsibility and the Market Shift</p><p>Nouveau Monde's commitment and actions are part of a global effort to reduce<br/>GHG emissions in order to become environmentally responsible and accountable<br/>corporate citizens. At the heart of our actions, is the duty to care for our<br/>planet. The United Nations' Paris Agreement is a legally binding<br/>international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP<br/>21 in Paris, on December 12th, 2015 and entered into force on November 4th,<br/>2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 C, preferably to<br/>1.5 C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term goal,<br/>countries aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible<br/>to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. The Paris Agreement is a<br/>landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first<br/>time, a binding agreement brings all participating nations to a common cause<br/>to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its<br/>effects. Implementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social<br/>transformation, based on the best available science. The Paris Agreement<br/>works on a 5-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action. The first<br/>step is for countries to submit their plans for climate action known as<br/>nationally determined contributions (\"NDCs\"). In their NDCs, countries<br/>communicate actions they will take to reduce their GHG emissions in order to<br/>reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the<br/>NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of<br/>rising temperatures. Canada has set a target to have all light-duty car<br/>sales to be electric by 2040.</p><p>As reported by Hans Eric Malin on December 15th, 2020 ( Analysis of the new<br/>EU battery regulation - Circular Energy Storage), the European Union is now<br/>working on a new Battery regulation to be adopted and progressively deployed<br/>in the next few years. The new regulation aims to introduce maximum carbon<br/>footprint and traceability. Nouveau Monde has been selected by the Global<br/>Battery Alliance (\"GBA\") as the pilot project to implement traceability of<br/>minerals for the mining and battery materials industries.</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution and a multitude of means of<br/>reductions must be implemented across all countries and economic sectors<br/>both globally and locally. As stated by the GBA on their website (<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/global-battery-alliance\">https://www.weforum.org/global-battery-alliance</url>), a circular and responsible<br/>battery value chain is one of the major drivers to realize the 2 C Paris<br/>Agreement goal in the transport and power sectors, setting course towards<br/>achieving the 1.5 C goal if complemented with other technologies and<br/>collaborative efforts. The transition towards cleaner sources of energy, the<br/>production and use of the strategic and critical minerals can contribute to<br/>efforts to limit rise of the temperature.</p><p>In the achievement of this global challenge, Nouveau Monde can most<br/>effectively contribute by ensuring that the production of its LiB Anode<br/>material and other advanced graphite products is carbon-neutral and with the<br/>lowest possible environmental footprint in the respect of local communities,<br/>minimizing any potentially negative impacts while enhancing the positive<br/>effects.</p><p>About Nouveau Monde</p><p>Nouveau Monde is working to position itself as a key element in the<br/>sustainable energy revolution.

Gleich zwei Bilder von Albert Einstein zieren die W\u00e4nde in dem sonst eher zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigen Bau in der Ulmer Wissenschaftsstadt. Auf Einstein k\u00f6nne man ruhig stolz sein, sagt Radermacher, schlie\u00dflich sei er Ulms ber\u00fchmtester Sohn. Auf dem Konferenztisch steht auch eine kleine Plastik des L\u00f6wenmenschen, eines der \u00e4ltesten Kunstwerke der Menschheit, der 1939 im Hohlenstein-Stadel, einer H\u00f6hle nahe Ulm, gefunden wurde. Bald, so erz\u00e4hlt der Nachhaltigkeitsforscher stolz, werde sein Institut eine originalgetreue Nachbildung der ber\u00fchmten Figur bekommen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Herr Professor Radermacher, ist die Welt, wie wir sie kennen, noch zu retten?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wenn man damit die Erde und die lebende Natur meint, muss man die Welt nicht retten. Wenn Sie mit der Welt den Ort meinen, auf dem Menschen leben, wird die Frage komplizierter. Milliarden Menschen leben aktuell sehr schlecht. Das ist nicht unbedingt etwas, was man w\u00fcrde retten wollen. Die eigentliche Frage ist: Kann man sich eine Welt vorstellen, in der bis 2050 zehn Milliarden Menschen tendenziell besser als heute leben?</p><p>Wenn man Greta Thunberg und den Fridays-for-Future-Aktivisten glaubt, ist das nicht sehr wahrscheinlich.</p><p>Im Moment ist in der Entwicklung des Klimas das Risiko angelegt, die Lage sehr vieler Menschen zu verschlechtern. Das halte ich f\u00fcr das wahrscheinlichere Ergebnis der Prozesse der n\u00e4chsten 30 bis 40 Jahre. Das hei\u00dft: weniger Wohlstand. Denn weniger Wohlstand ist gut f\u00fcr das Klima. Bei der heutigen Technologie bedeutet mehr Wohlstand n\u00e4mlich immer auch mehr Ressourcenverbrauch und mehr CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Emissionen.</p><p>Die Bundesregierung hat j\u00fcngst ihr Klimaschutzpaket aufgelegt. Wie beurteilen Sie den Kompromiss?</p><p>Wenig innovativ. Im Weltma\u00dfstab betrachtet, gibt es kaum deutsche CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Emissionen. Insofern ist das, was wir hier einsparen, f\u00fcr das Klima relativ irrelevant. Vor allem im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu dem, was in Afrika, Indien und S\u00fcdostasien in den n\u00e4chsten Jahrzehnten an CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Emissionen hinzukommen wird. Hier m\u00fcssten wir uns st\u00e4rker engagieren. Der wichtigste Beitrag, den ein Hochtechnologie-Land wie Deutschland leisten kann, ist ansonsten, neue Technologien zu entwickeln.</p><p>Dadurch werden die Emissionen aber erstmal nicht gesenkt.</p><p>Wenn wir keine anderen Technologien finden, ist das Klimaproblem nur \u00fcber weniger Wohlstand zu l\u00f6sen. Zur Not erzwingt die Klimakatastrophe eine Verarmung, vielleicht auch ein Massensterben. Deshalb ist die entscheidende Frage, was wir mit unserem Geld tun, um den Klimawandel aufzuhalten.</p><p>Was schlagen Sie vor?</p><p>Aus meiner Sicht ist es am kl\u00fcgsten, international sofort die Regenw\u00e4lder zu sch\u00fctzen. Jeder Hektar Regenwald speichert als Folge der Photosynthese heute 500 bis 700 Tonnen CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Wenn dieser Regenwald abgeholzt oder abgebrannt wird, geht ein Gro\u00dfteil des gebundenen CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in die Atmosph\u00e4re.</p><p>Muss nicht auch der Einzelne mehr tun?</p><p>Das ist immer ein Ansatz. Er kann insbesondere helfen, sich besser zu f\u00fchlen. Als genereller Ansatz wird die Individualisierung aber nicht funktionieren. Denn sie basiert auf dem Suffizienz-Gedanken, also der Idee des Selbstverzichts: Sei mit weniger zufrieden und werde mit weniger gl\u00fccklicher. Was die meisten Leute dabei nicht ber\u00fccksichtigen: Das dadurch gesparte Geld wird irgendwo in den Wirtschaftskreislauf eingespeist werden - und sei es, dass es bei einer Bank liegt und sie das Geld als Kredit an ein Unternehmen ausgibt. Dann erzeugt das hier eingesparte Geld woanders doch CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Emissionen.</p><p>Ist unser aktuelles Wirtschaftssystem \u00fcberhaupt f\u00e4hig, den Klimawandel aufzuhalten?</p><p>In der jetzigen Auspr\u00e4gung nicht. Unser System preist heute weder die sozialen noch die \u00f6kologischen Kosten unseres Wirtschaftens ad\u00e4quat ein. Wir handeln rund um den Globus, wir importieren die billigen T-Shirts und wir lassen den M\u00fcll anderswo als Recyclinggut bearbeiten. Insofern ist unsere globale \u00d6konomie in vielen Dimensionen ein \"Pl\u00fcndersystem\".</p><p>Fast alle sind inzwischen einig, dass das Klima gesch\u00fctzt werden muss. Genauso herrscht Einigkeit, dass die Ungleichheit zwischen Arm und Reich zu gro\u00df ist. Warum passiert dennoch so wenig?</p><p>Es hat sich gezeigt, dass wir in den weltweiten Koordinierungsprozessen zu versagen drohen. Das hat unter anderem etwas damit zu tun, wie die Globalisierung eine bestimmte soziale Schicht ausgepresst hat. Das sind zum Beispiel die Industriearbeiter in den USA und in Gro\u00dfbritannien - die Folgen davon sind \"Trump\", \"Brexit\" und eine generelle Tendenz zu Renationalisierung. Das sind keine Umfelder, die f\u00fcr globale Kooperation g\u00fcnstig sind.</p><p>F\u00fcr die Bek\u00e4mpfung des Klimawandels ist globale Kooperation aber unbedingt notwendig. Was nun?</p><p>Es war immer meine Hauptthese, dass wir eine neue Technologie brauchen, um die weltweiten Energie- und Klimaprobleme zu l\u00f6sen. Daf\u00fcr gab es bis vor kurzem \u00fcberhaupt keine realistische L\u00f6sung. Jetzt scheint es eine zu geben.</p><p>Welche?</p><p>Die L\u00f6sung hat drei Komponenten. Der eine Punkt ist: Wir brauchen auf jeden Fall ganz viel Geld. Es war nie klar, woher das Geld kommen soll. Eine gro\u00dfe Chance, dieses Geld jetzt zu bekommen, ist internationale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Kompensation.</p><p>Wie funktioniert das?</p><p>Jemand aus Deutschland hilft, ein Projekt in Afrika zu finanzieren, bei dem abgeholzter Regenwald wieder aufgeforstet wird. Man kann mit den richtigen Projekten sowohl die Entwicklung f\u00f6rdern, als auch die Klimasituation verbessern, weil Wald CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aus der Atmosph\u00e4re holt, gleichzeitig Arbeit f\u00fcr die Menschen vor Ort schafft und Biodiversit\u00e4t f\u00f6rdert. Diese Projekte werden von Unternehmen finanziert, die daf\u00fcr dann ein Zertifikat erhalten, das best\u00e4tigt, dass mit dem Geld ein bestimmter Betrag CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aus der Atmosph\u00e4re geholt wurde.</p><p>Diese Angebote gibt es ja jetzt schon: Wenn ich eine Flugreise buche, kann ich bei der Airline meine Emissionen kompensieren.</p><p>Richtig. Mittlerweile machen das einige Fluglinien auch schon von sich aus. British Airways hat j\u00fcngst bekannt gegeben, dass sie alle innerbritischen Fl\u00fcge \u00fcber Kompensationen klimaneutral stellen werden, Air France ebenfalls. Bosch will von n\u00e4chstem Jahr an klimaneutral sein. Die Organisation von Kompensationsprojekten ist ein wichtiges Thema. Wir m\u00fcssen in Richtung massiver Kompensation gehen. Das beschafft kurzfristig Geld. Die zweite S\u00e4ule zur L\u00f6sung der Klimaprobleme sind die sogenannten \"Nature-based solutions\".</p><p>Was ist das?</p><p>Darunter fallen konsequenter Regenwaldschutz, konsequente Aufforstung auf ausgelaugten B\u00f6den in den Tropen und konsequente Umr\u00fcstung der Landwirtschaft in Richtung Humusbildung. Bei der Bildung von Humus wird ein gro\u00dfer Teil des Kohlenstoffs, der in Pflanzen gespeichert ist, im Boden eingelagert. Je mehr Humus auf landwirtschaftlichen Fl\u00e4chen gebildet wird, umso mehr werden B\u00f6den zu Kohlenstoffsenken, w\u00e4hrend sie heute meist noch CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Quellen sind. Die dritte und wahrscheinlich wichtigste S\u00e4ule sind synthetische Kraftstoffe, also hochenergetische Fl\u00fcssigkeiten vom Typ Benzin - aber solche, die klimaneutral sind.</p><p>Ihre Idee ist, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; zu recyceln - wie funktioniert dieser Kreislauf?</p><p>Eine wichtige Rolle spielt Wasserstoff. Wasserstoff ist ein \"Kraft-Tiger\". Aber er ist schwer zu beherrschen. Uns interessiert vor allem gr\u00fcner Wasserstoff, der durch Elektrolyse von Wasser entsteht. Dieser Wasserstoff ist gr\u00fcn, wenn die Energie, mit der man ihn generiert, gr\u00fcn ist - also zum Beispiel solaren Ursprungs. Das ist zu ertr\u00e4glichen Preisen m\u00f6glich, wenn man preiswerten Sonnenstrom zur Verf\u00fcgung hat, zum Beispiel aus der Sahara. Man kann den Wasserstoff \"b\u00e4ndigen\", wenn man ihn mit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; zu Methanol verbindet. Dann hat man eine Fl\u00fcssigkeit, die \u00e4hnlich gut zu handhaben ist wie Benzin.</p><p>Bei der Verbrennung von Methanol w\u00fcrde aber auch wieder CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;entstehen, oder?</p><p>Ja, bei der Verbrennung von Methanol wird die gleiche Menge CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; frei wie bei Benzin\u00a0- dieses CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; wurde aber abgefangen und w\u00e4re eigentlich schon in der Atmosph\u00e4re. Wenn das Methanol dann anschlie\u00dfend beispielsweise in einem Stahlwerk eingesetzt w\u00fcrde, kann das CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; wieder direkt am Fabrikschornstein abgefangen werden und zur Herstellung von neuem Methanol genutzt werden. Wenn man das alles richtig macht und oft genug recycelt, kann man die CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Emissionen insgesamt dramatisch absenken - nach meinen Berechnungen auf etwa ein F\u00fcnftel des heutigen Wertes.</p><p>Sie besch\u00e4ftigen sich seit Jahren mit Klimaschutz, Globalisierung und Gerechtigkeit. Jahrelang haben die Themen die \u00d6ffentlichkeit wenig interessiert. Ist das nicht frustrierend?</p><p>Ich habe auf all das eher einen wissenschaftlichen Blick. Frustration w\u00fcrde im \u00dcbrigen auch nicht helfen. Wenn man \u00fcberlegt, wie unangenehm und h\u00e4sslich die Zukunft f\u00fcr viele Menschen werden kann, wird man nach einer L\u00f6sung suchen, solange man noch eine Chance f\u00fcr eine gute Entwicklung sieht. Das tue ich.</p><p>Sie werden immer wieder als Weltretter beschrieben. Wie empfinden Sie so eine Zuschreibung?</p><p>Die Konzentration auf einzelne Menschen, auf einzelne Weltretter, ist Unsinn. Wenn \u00fcberhaupt, dann bin ich ein Mit-Weltretter. Ich bin jemand, der sich in Zusammenarbeit mit anderen darum bem\u00fcht, die Qualit\u00e4t des Lebens f\u00fcr m\u00f6glichst viele Menschen hochzuhalten. Ich bin enorm dankbar daf\u00fcr, was wir in Europa an Lebensbedingungen f\u00fcr sehr viele Menschen erreicht haben. Ich habe deshalb etwas dagegen, wenn immer alles schlechtgeredet wird.</p><p>Bef\u00fcrchten Sie, dass die Menschen des Klimathemas \u00fcberdr\u00fcssig werden?</p><p>Das Thema geht im \u00f6ffentlichen Interesse auf und ab, das ist vollkommen normal. Ich glaube nicht, dass das Thema wegen der aktuellen \u00dcberbetonung anschlie\u00dfend verschwindet. Es ist eher so: Man muss das Eisen schmieden, solange es hei\u00df ist. Wenn um \"Greta\" herum jetzt vieles geht, sollte man das ausnutzen.</p><p>Sie sind jetzt 69 Jahre alt, haben Sie schon mal ans Aufh\u00f6ren gedacht?</p><p>Im Leben ergibt sich vieles von alleine. Man wird nur so lange etwas tun, wie man glaubt, dass man einen positiven Beitrag leisten kann. Ich bin in einer Situation, in der ich sehr viele Dinge mitbef\u00f6rdern kann. Wer M\u00f6glichkeiten hat und sie nicht nutzt, muss sich fragen, ob er seiner Verantwortung gerecht wird. Aufh\u00f6ren ist f\u00fcr mich deshalb aktuell kein Thema. Aber das wird sich irgendwann \u00e4ndern. So ist der Lauf der Dinge.</p>", "publisher": "S\u00fcdwest Presse", "instances": ["Wir m\u00fcssen in Richtung massiver Kompensation gehen.
