Nauru, ranked the world's fifth most vulnerable nation under the United Nations' Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) for its heightened exposure to economic and environmental shocks, launched the program as a way for conscientious investors to acquire an additional citizenship while contributing to climate adaptation and sustainable development projects in the South Pacific. Program CEO Edward Clark revealed the first approved applicant is a German family of four who recently sold their long-standing family business - a well- known, reputable German company - and are currently living in Dubai. \"They were looking for a second citizenship to provide them with a Plan B given the current global political volatility and chose the Nauru Economic &amp; Climate Resilience Citizenship Program because the contribution was going towards tackling the impacts of climate change on the island,\" he explained. Mr Clark, who has an extensive background in international banking, financial crime and compliance, said it took under four months from receiving the application to the granting of citizenship, and that strict due diligence processes were followed. \"This is a fundamental pillar of our program and a safeguard for Nauru's reputation and security,\" he said. \"All applicants undergo checks with international law enforcement agencies and are subject to in-depth background verification. Our entire application process is consistent with international best practices.\" He said only individuals of the highest calibre who can participate in shaping Nauru's future will be granted citizenship. \"The granting of Nauruan citizenship to this family marks a major milestone for the program and provides even more confidence to those who are currently exploring Nauru citizenship by investment.\" Nauru is embarking on a long-term project that will reform the nation in the face of economic challenges and climate change, which as well as dealing with issues like food and water security, includes the \"Higher Ground Initiative\" - relocating almost the entire population from the coast to higher ground.

Serve cold, preferably with a side of exam-induced anxiety that manifests as vehement vomiting or diarrhoea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if I told you that, after all this academic seasoning, the finished product barely qualifies as half-baked on the global scale? According to the World Bank, Bangladesh's Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) is now functionally equivalent to Grade 7 internationally. Yes, after 12 years of schooling, our students are emerging five years behind the global standard. That's not a learning gap, it's a canyon and not the grand kind.</p><p>Despite noble intentions and plenty of committees with acronyms longer than novels, our national curriculum still operates on one central principle: education is less about learning and more about surviving a system designed to test memory rather than meaning. The National Curriculum Framework 2021 promised to revolutionise education through \"competency-based learning,\" \"integrated assessments,\" and \"lifelong learning skills.\" Lovely. But much like my New Year's resolution to take up pilates, the intentions are there-just not the follow-through.</p><p>The truth is that the curriculum continues to reward regurgitation over reflection. Want proof? Open any board exam script. You'll find students rewarded for copying textbook paragraphs verbatim.</p><p>Science, meanwhile, is less about discovering the world and more about memorising definitions like a corporate compliance manual. Religion is taught as moral absolutes with minimal room for interpretation. And civic education-formally lumped into \"Bangladesh and Global Studies\"-remains stuck in the glorious past of the Liberation War, with little engagement on democratic values, constitutional rights or climate justice. The idea that a student might question why freedom of expression is only celebrated in textbooks and not tolerated in classrooms is, frankly, revolutionary-and not in a way the authorities would appreciate.</p><p>And speaking of values: where is the conversation around consent, gender equity or mental health? We have an entire generation going through puberty with the emotional intelligence of a brick because the word \"sex\" still sends policymakers into a shameful panic. There is no comprehensive sex education, no guidance on bodily autonomy, and no meaningful engagement with the reality of gender-based violence. But sure, let's spend three pages explaining types of sedimentary rocks.</p><p>If we are to believe the curriculum is designed to prepare children for the 21st century, then can someone please explain why financial literacy, digital safety, media misinformation, and climate adaptation are still missing from the syllabus?</p><p>To be fair, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has tried to modernise. The new curriculum for classes 1-5, launched in 2023, ditches final exams and introduces continuous assessment. It also encourages thematic learning across disciplines. But implementation has been chaotic. Teachers remain undertrained, class sizes balloon, and textbooks are riddled with errors. According to the 2022 BRAC Education Watch report, only 23 percent of primary school teachers had received in-depth training in competency-based instruction.</p><p>And let's not forget the elephant in the classroom: inequality. Students in elite urban schools get smart classrooms, extracurriculars, and debate clubs. Meanwhile, rural schools still lack toilets, let alone trained teachers for integrated learning. The English version of the national curriculum is marginally better resourced, but it still suffers from the same outdated pedagogy, just in awkwardly translated English.</p><p>The truth is, we need an education system that doesn't just manufacture employees or engineers, but nurtures citizens to become curious, compassionate, and capable of questioning the status quo without fearing that a red pen will ruin their future. This means reimagining the entire philosophy of the curriculum. Ditch rote learning entirely. Revamp textbooks to pose questions, not just provide model answers. Reward analysis over memorisation. Infuse classrooms with real-life context.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of this transformation, and they must be treated as such. This means proper pay, professional development, and pedagogical freedom-not just strict instructions to finish the syllabus like a robot with a whistle. It also means democratising the curriculum design process. Right now, it's a top-down exercise dominated by bureaucrats, where educators, psychologists, parents, and-dare we suggest-students have minimal input. The 2024 textbook controversy, where glaring errors and politically sanitised omissions made headlines, should be a wake-up call for genuine transparency and public review.</p><p>We also need to audit the relevance of the curriculum. Why are children still learning about out-of-date agricultural production figures instead of sustainable farming practices? Why are their moral lessons framed around obedience, but not empathy or ethics in the digital age? Why is Life Skills Education an occasional workshop rather than a core subject that includes mental health, climate resilience, conflict resolution, and the basics of being a functional adult?</p><p>Until these questions are taken seriously, underneath those perfect GPAs and patriotic essays will remain a grim truth: we are handing out Grade 12 certificates for a Grade 7 education.</p><p>We can either keep producing graduates who top the charts but bottom out on creativity, confidence, and critical consciousness, or we can start treating our children like future leaders. But for that, we need a curriculum that doesn't just pass the exam but passes the test of life.</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["Why are children still learning about out-of-date agricultural production figures instead of sustainable farming practices?

Adequate funding is essential to support mitigation and adaptation initiatives, empowering these countries to manage the effects of climate change while advancing sustainable development. According to the Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2023 report by the Climate Policy Initiative, global investments in climate projects rose to USD 1.3 trillion between 2021 and 2022. However, to achieve the 1.5\u00b0C target set by the Paris Agreement, these investments need to increase fivefold. As a leader in global climate action, the UAE has taken a prominent role in driving efforts to mobilise climate finance through a range of global initiatives that advance the global climate agenda and strengthen international co-operation in environmental sustainability and supporting the green transition. The 10th edition of the World Green Economy Summit (WGES), organised by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), places a special focus on climate finance as a central theme. Recognised as a key driver for enhancing climate resilience, climate finance will be a primary topic of discussion among global leaders, experts and specialists in green finance. WGES will be held on 2-3 October 2024 at the Dubai World Trade Centre. Registration is open on . ?The World Green Economy Summit has established itself as a cornerstone of the global climate movement and a premier platform for discussions on various green transition issues. The 10th edition of the summit builds on the outcomes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), hosted by the UAE last year in Expo City Dubai. One of COP28's significant achievements was the historic UAE Consensus, which set a new course for international climate action through an ambitious and comprehensive plan. Among the major decisions was the launch of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience, aimed at bolstering global adaptation efforts to address climate change effects by supporting climate-resilient sustainable development goals. This year, the summit emphasises climate finance as a vital tool in building a green, resilient and equitable future. By mobilising the necessary funding and investments, we aim to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries, support the most affected communities and align with local and global efforts to utilise financial mechanisms to combat the impacts of climate change,? said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD&amp;CEO of DEWA and Chairman of WGEO.

The new policy is closely aligned with European Union priorities, particularly in climate action, gender equality, and good governance.  The launch was officiated by H.E. Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre in Dar es Salaam. In attendance were Dr. Hussein Ali Mwinyi, President of Zanzibar and Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, members of the Diplomatic Corps, senior government leaders, and representatives from the private sector.  Tanzania's foreign policy, once centered on sovereignty, self-reliance, and non-alignment, has evolved steadily to address global realities. The 2001 revision introduced economic diplomacy. The 2025 update now places sustainable development, gender equity, and climate resilience at the core of Tanzania's global approach.  President Samia emphasized that the revised policy was shaped through a participatory process involving Tanzanians from across the country. \"It was high time we revised the policy to cope with global shifts in various spheres,\" she said. These shifts include the growing competition for strategic minerals, the transition to renewable energy, and disruptions in trade due to international conflicts.  \"This policy speaks on who we are as a nation-firm in our values, proactive in our diplomacy, and committed to constructive partnerships that advance peace, security, and shared prosperity,\" she noted.  The revised guidelines include special training for envoys and the introduction of a Special Status for the Tanzanian diaspora. The status will enable non-citizen Tanzanians abroad to invest and own land, enhancing their contribution to national development. President Samia called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to utilize retired diplomats in training government officials on policy implementation.  President Mwinyi welcomed the policy as a timely instrument for unlocking Tanzania's potential. \"The revised policy aligns with the evolving world and will unlock opportunities in many areas socially, economically, and politically,\" he said. He also called for efforts to attract more consulates to Zanzibar to strengthen international visibility and engagement.  \"We should use the policy to protect the interest of our country. These guidelines will benefit both sides of the Union-Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar,\" President Mwinyi added.  Under President Samia's leadership, Tanzania has actively re-engaged with European nations, including Germany, France, the Nordic countries, and the European Union.  The Government has maintained access to EU markets under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, while the revised policy also targets deeper partnerships through initiatives such as the EU Global Gateway and Africa-Europe digital and green transitions.  In February 2022, President Samia visited France, where she met with President Emmanuel Macron. The visit resulted in six strategic agreements in energy, agriculture, and infrastructure-signaling a reset in France-Tanzania relations.  Later that month, she traveled to Belgium to participate in the 6th EU-AU Summit, securing EUR425 million in development funding. She also advocated for lifting sanctions on Burundi-highlighting Tanzania's constructive diplomacy in the region.  President Samia's February 2024 trip to Vatican City, where she met the late Pope Francis, underscored Tanzania's commitment to interfaith dialogue and social inclusion. She also traveled to Norway, establishing cooperation in the blue economy, renewable energy, and agriculture-key components of Tanzania's sustainable development goals.  Earlier engagements included investment-driven missions to the United Kingdom and participation in COP26 in Glasgow, where she called for increased international climate financing to support African countries.  In April 2024, President Samia paid a state visit to Turkey, where she signed six Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) marking a significant boost in Tanzania-Turkey relations.  Further strengthening Tanzania's European ties, the Ukrainian Embassy was officially established in Dar es Salaam in 2024, signaling growing diplomatic engagement and mutual interest in trade, development, and multilateral cooperation.  Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the revised policy seeks to deepen cooperation with development partners, support non-alignment, and enhance South-South collaboration.  He outlined 10 thematic areas in the revised policy:    1. Economic Diplomacy - Strengthening investment and trade.    2. Peace, Security, and Political Stability - Advancing conflict     resolution and cooperation.    3. Ratification of Treaties - Ensuring legal and institutional coherence.    4. Global and Regional Engagement - Strengthening Tanzania's participation     in international institutions.    5. Kiswahili as a Diplomatic Tool - Promoting language and culture     globally.    6. Resource Mobilization - Attracting funding for development projects.    7. Blue Economy - Leveraging marine and coastal resources.    8. Diaspora Participation - Engaging Tanzanians abroad in development.    9. Human Rights and Governance - Upholding constitutional values and     social justice.    10. Climate Leadership - Promoting environmental resilience and green     growth.  These areas reflect Tanzania's commitment to inclusive diplomacy and a rules-based international order-principles that align well with European values and global priorities.  The revised foreign policy positions Tanzania as an assertive, values-driven, and globally engaged country. With strong alignment to EU and European nation priorities, Tanzania is set to deepen collaboration in trade, climate resilience, education, cultural exchange, and governance.

They work long hours yet earn barely enough to sustain their families. In India, informal workers make up almost 90 % of the workforce, but despite being the backbone of the economy, they remain invisible and unheard. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As they lack formal recognition, informal workers are excluded from government support such as health insurance and maternity benefits. Formal banks are also very unlikely to lend to them, forcing informal workers in need of financing to turn to exploitative moneylenders. Climate change exacerbates their plight, with floods, irregular monsoons and extreme heat disrupting their livelihoods. They live in an economy where labour is abundant, and employment opportunities are scarce.</p><p>But the story of women working in India's informal sector is not just one of economic hardship - it is a story of courage, resistance, unity and determination. For more than 50 years now, women in India have been teaming up to support each other for more economic security and self-reliance. In 1972, the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) was founded by lawyer and unionist Ela Bhatt. It has become a movement of self-employed women in the informal economy. Today, SEWA has over 3.2 million women members across 18 states in India and a growing grassroots presence in neighbouring Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Their goal: to secure their future together, advocating for labour rights, economic empowerment and climate resilience. </p><p>The secret of success is collective action</p><p>Organising joint action is the driving force behind all SEWA activities. Members come together in collectives based around their professions and geographical locations. As a group of women with similar occupations, they can be more effective in advocating for their rights. They have a louder voice to speak in politics or to request assistance from donors and supporters.</p><p>Although SEWA receives some funding from both Indian and international donors, it also relies on the membership fees paid by the women involved. It is the women themselves who decide how the money is spent. SEWA's local groups identify the issues that are having the greatest impact on their lives and take action accordingly. </p><p>The issues addressed by SEWA's campaigns are as diverse as its membership. Yet every action must align with its overall principles: Initiatives must create or enhance employment opportunities, earnings or asset ownership for women as well as improve their access to essential services like food, healthcare, childcare and sanitation. They must also foster collective strength, leadership, self-reliance or education. </p><p>One of SEWA's recent initiatives was called Pakki Bheet ('solid brick wall'). In August 2024, heavy rainfall caused massive flooding in Gujarat province. Dozens of people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants had to be evacuated. As many of SEWA's members had lost their homes, the association set up a support scheme. SEWA made permanent yet affordable housing available for them with one condition: The house should be owned and registered in the name of the respective SEWA member - not in the name of any other male member of the family. </p><p>The programme was funded by the state government of Gujarat. SEWA hired architects and construction experts to design the houses and trained the association's members in masonry, construction, plumbing and carpentry so that they could build their own houses. As a result, the women have built 6000 new houses in the hard-hit districts of Surendranagar and Kutch. Some of the women who took part in the training have now taken up masonry, plumbing or carpentry as a profession and are providing these services in their villages and surrounding areas.</p><p>The SEWA community has been campaigning for decades for some form of minimum income for informal workers, as many of them are paid less than the legal minimum. In sectors as diverse as domestic work, agriculture and construction, collective bargaining can establish a fairer baseline. SEWA members also try to collectively influence pricing in local markets or advocate for a minimum piece rate to protect their livelihoods from instability. Furthermore, SEWA members are trying to set up social-security schemes. For example, they have set up cooperatives to provide full-time childcare for factory and agricultural workers. They are staffed by women from their local communities and the costs are subsidised by community donations, grants and government support. In another example, SEWA's healthcare collectives have set up local centres where local women who have been trained at nearby hospitals in basic healthcare, such as taking blood pressure, temperature and vital signs, offer their services.</p><p>Back in 1974, about 4000 SEWA members founded the Shri Mahila SEWA Sahakari Bank aimed at improving access to credit and banking services at attractive rates of interest. Having limited access to formal banking services, informal workers often have to resort to moneylenders who demand extremely high interest rates. </p><p>Furthermore, the SEWA community has initiated several women-led enterprises that facilitate market access for self-employed workers. In the 1990s for instance, more than 30,000 women waste pickers in the city of Ahmedabad first formed a local SEWA cooperative and then, in 1995, founded Shri Gitanjali Mahila SEWA Industrial Stationery Producers Cooperative Ltd. Owned and run by its members, the enterprise manufactures stationery products from recycled waste gathered by the collective's members. Then there is RUDI, an enterprise collectively owned and operated by smallholder farmers who sell their produce through a network of female sales agents. </p><p>Today's most pressing issue: climate action</p><p>In 2022, to mark the 50th anniversary of SEWA's foundation, SEWA members decided to address the recurring impact of climate change on their health, livelihoods, nutrition and welfare and collectively launched the Swacch Aaakash ('clean skies') campaign. It aims to provide women with opportunities to adapt to and mitigate climate-change impacts. The women began installing green technologies such as biogas plants and cool roofs thanks to the Hariyali Gram ('green villages') initiative, while the Kheti Jhumbesh ('agriculture') campaign saw them engage in regenerative farming, soil restoration and the use of organic fertilisers. </p><p>They also set up two microinsurance schemes: The Livelihood Recovery and Resilience Fund provides financing solutions for adaptation and mitigation of climate risks, while the Extreme Heat Income Microinsurance compensates insured SEWA members with a day's wage when temperatures exceed a certain threshold. Both are parametric insurances, meaning that payouts don't require a claim to be made by the insured. Instead, compensation is paid automatically if, for example, extreme heat persists for two days. Each insured woman contributes a small amount each year - and receives direct cash assistance when temperatures soar or natural disasters strike. SEWA's insurance programme has grown rapidly: By 2024 it already covered 50,000 informal workers, ranging from farmers to waste recyclers.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Today, SEWA has over 3. 2 million women members across 18 states in India and a growing grassroots presence in neighbouring Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

In response, an innovative financial product-the Cardano Impact for UNHCR ETP (CASL)-launches on 28 May on the SIX Swiss Exchange, creating a bridge between institutional capital and humanitarian relief through blockchain. The CASL ETP (Ticker: CASL | ISIN: CH1327686056) is the first-ever regulated exchange-traded product that converts blockchain staking rewards into continuous funding for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. The product offers investors exposure to Cardano (ADA), while automatically donating 100% of staking rewards-not principal-toward field operations supporting refugees across over 135 countries, including Syria, Sudan, and Venezuela. \"This launch represents a world first in sustainable finance and humanitarian aid,\" said Oliver Anselmo, Deputy Executive Director at Switzerland for UNHCR. \"It transforms passive investment returns into a recurring, scalable stream of support for people who have lost everything.\" Quantifying Impact Based on current ADA staking yields (~3.5% APY) and projections of initial fund inflows, the CASL ETP could generate $1.5 to $2 million in annual donations with $50 million in assets under management-funds that directly power UNHCR's emergency response and innovative refugee programs. Industry-First Technical and Regulatory Design Structured by issuance.swiss AG and operated under Swiss regulatory approval, CASL is physically backed 1:1 by ADA, with a 1.5% management fee. It bypasses crypto-native complexities through a familiar ISIN, allowing institutions to invest using USD, EUR, or CHF-with no wallets, private keys, or blockchain knowledge required. \"CASL is an industry-first that merges full regulatory compliance, institutional-grade staking infrastructure, and humanitarian aid in one product,\" said Laurent Kssis, CIO at issuance.swiss AG. \"We've eliminated the operational barriers-from fiat on-ramps to staking-and embedded impact at the protocol layer of capital allocation.\" Powered by Trusted Partners Custody and staking are operated by Taurus SA, a FINMA-regulated securities firm and leader in digital asset infrastructure, based in Geneva, Switzerland. ADA contributions to the underlying stake pool include 3.5 million ADA from the Cardano Foundation, alongside more than 200 delegations of holdings from the HOSKY team and their fans for a total amount of 6.3 million ADA, underscoring community trust and sustainability. \"Our infrastructure secures the ADA and operates staking pools to maximize both yield and impact,\" said Lamine Brahimi, Managing Partner at Taurus SA. \"We are extremely proud to extend our partnership with UNHCR for Switzerland and with Cardano, and to demonstrate how innovation can be a force for good by providing support to forcibly displaced people.\" Why Cardano? Why UNHCR? \"From funding streams to digital ID, one thing is clear: blockchain has the potential to be a great leveler, providing innovative ways of solving some of the administrative problems that make seeking refuge even harder. With the technology and use cases now at a stage where they have the capacity to substantially facilitate daily operations, the widespread adoption of humanitarian blockchain solutions must become one of the industry's key priorities,\" said Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation. Cardano currently ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap (~$22 billion), with ADA priced at approximately $0.62 as of May 2025. Its proof-of- stake consensus, peer-reviewed architecture, and environmental efficiency make it uniquely suited for mission-critical applications. The Bigger Picture This model is already drawing attention from other humanitarian and philanthropic entities. \"We believe this model can and should be replicated,\" added Pavel Izmaylov, CEO of issuance.swiss AG. \"Discussions are already underway to launch additional impact-linked ETPs supporting education, climate resilience, and public health within the next 6 to 12 months.\" An early institutional investor Florian Volery, Liqwid.Finance, commented: \"CASL gives us ADA exposure, recently included in US Fed Reserve digital assets and the only blockchain never experienced any technical outage, while automatically contributing to one of the most urgent causes of our time-it's smart capital at its best.\" Product Summary   * Name: Cardano Impact for UNHCR ETP (CASL)   * Ticker: CASL | ISIN: CH1327686056   * Launch Date: May 28, 2025   * Exchange: SIX Swiss Exchange   * Management Fee: 1.5%   * Custodian &amp; Staking Operator: Taurus SA   * Currency: USD / EUR / CHF   * Underlying: 100% physically backed Cardano (ADA) About UNHCR UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, protects and assists people forced to flee due to conflict and persecution.

Professor Verkooijen, who also serves as President and CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and Chancellor of the University of Nairobi, described how the world has entered an era of unprecedented change-one where climate resilience is no longer an option, but a necessity. \"We may not want this new world order, but we have it-and we are getting more of it,\"  he  declared,  pointing  to  the  rapid political shifts globally that are leading   to   rollbacks   in   climate  finance,  deregulation,  and  shrinking international  cooperation.  \"The  Paris  regime  suffers a terminal illness and President  Donald  Trump  has  simply  pulled  the  plug  from  its life support system..\" The End of the 1.5-Degree Era During his address, Professor Verkooijen underscored the sobering reality that the 1.5\\xB0C threshold set by the Paris Agreement will be reached within the next two years, with global emissions at record highs. This, he warned, means that extreme weather events, food insecurity, and forced migration will intensify at a scale previously unimagined. \"We  are stuck on this overheated and overheating planet, and we cannot go back. Stuck  in a world  where each half-degree  of warming can  double the disasters. That's  the math. That's the reality,\" he stated. He also predicted that climate impacts  will  not  only  lead  to  mass  displacement  but  will  create  stark inequalities,  where wealthier  nations and  communities build resilience, while vulnerable regions face climate apartheid. Adaptation: The Only Way Forward Despite this grim prognosis, Professor Verkooijen offered a clear path forward-one grounded in adaptation and economic resilience. \"Adaptation  is not a  'nice-to-have'but a jobs  strategy, a growth strategy, an economic  winner,\"  he  asserted.  Citing  data  from  the  Global Commission on Adaptation,  he emphasized that  for every dollar  invested in adaptation, up to $10  is returned, making  it one of  the smartest economic decisions governments and businesses can make. The Netherlands, he pointed out, serves as a model of adaptation success, having transformed itself from a \"sub-Ocean\" nation into one of the most resilient economies in the world. \"If you want to see what adaptation looks like, come to the Netherlands-we turned water into land and survival into prosperity.\" A Call to Reimagine Global Governance In his closing remarks, Professor Verkooijen called for a fundamental reimagining of global governance, financial systems, and development strategies to ensure resilience is embedded in all aspects of policymaking and investment. \"Let me offer you today three key suggestions for re-imagining our world order. First, we need to re-imagine the global social contract. Second, we need to re- imagine the global finance and development system. Third, we need to re-imagine research, innovation, and higher learning.\" \"The resilience revolution is here. The only question is whether we will embrace it-or pay the price for ignoring it,\" he concluded.

This collaboration aims to decarbonize transportation, expand electric vehicle (EV) charging access, and improve grid resilience while leveraging underutilized highway barriers and right of way to generate and store renewable energy. A key component of this initiative is the integration of Yotta Block, the next- generation modular energy storage system designed to maximize efficiency and minimize installation challenges. A New Approach to Sustainable Transportation &amp; Energy Infrastructure As states pursue ambitious Net Zero goals by 2050, leveraging highway electrification remains an underutilized opportunity. While the demand for EV charging continues to grow, challenges such as high energy consumption, grid constraints, and limited land availability have slowed widespread adoption of large-scale charging infrastructure. To address these issues, E2SOL's SSHM integrates cutting-edge solar generation, microgrid capabilities, and Yotta's new decentralized energy storage solution, Yotta Block, to create a scalable and resilient clean energy network. \"This partnership is about reimagining infrastructure,\" said Anthony Baro, Managing Principal at E2SOL. \"By combining E2SOL's Smart Solar Highway Median technology with Yotta Energy's innovative Yotta Block storage, we're enabling a future where highways not only move people but also generate, store, and distribute clean energy.\" Why This Matters   * Wireless EV Charging for On-the-Go Power - SSHM supports dynamic wireless     charging, allowing EVs to charge while driving.   * Resilient Energy Storage with Yotta Block - The compact 1kWh Yotta Block     replaces traditional ballast blocks, making solar+storage easier to install     and scale.   * Lower Costs &amp; New Revenue Streams - States can sell excess power back to the     grid, offsetting public utility expenses.   * Community Benefits - Local communities near highways, often marginalized by     higher energy costs, can access affordable solar power.   * Climate Resilience - Reduces reliance on vulnerable overhead power lines,     mitigating outages from extreme weather. Yotta Block: A Game-Changer for Solar Storage in Transportation Recently unveiled at Intersolar and Energy Storage North America, Yotta Block is a plug-and-play energy storage solution that eliminates the need for separate battery infrastructure. Instead, it integrates directly behind PV panels, making installation simpler, reducing costs, and optimizing space usage. According to Ryan Davies, CCO of Yotta Energy, \"Yotta Block revolutionizes solar+storage by making deployment effortless. Yotta's technology seamlessly integrates with E2SOL's Smart Solar Highway Medians, creating a decentralized power solution that's efficient, scalable, and resilient.\" A Nationwide Vision for Smarter Infrastructure This initiative aligns with state and federal renewable energy programs designed to expand EV charging infrastructure and modernize the grid. By leveraging existing highway medians, E2SOL and Yotta Energy are proving that sustainable infrastructure can be deployed efficiently, without requiring additional land acquisition. As part of their commitment to accelerating clean energy solutions, E2SOL and Yotta Energy are actively engaging with state agencies, utility providers, and transportation authorities to bring the Smart Solar Highway Median system to highways nationwide.

The study involved 47 adults in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 79 years on average. The research, which began in 2021 and was completed in 2023, installed a sensor in the room of participants to keep track of home temperature. The participants were also asked to fill out questionnaires multiple times a week regarding their concentration level.   The researchers discovered that temperatures between 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 75 degrees Fahrenheit inside the home are good for maintaining cognitive health, noting that moving below or above 7 degrees Fahrenheit in this range could cause attention difficulties.  \"Our results suggest that even under the current climate a considerable portion of older adults encounter indoor temperatures detrimental to their cognitive abilities,\" the scientists stated.  \"Climate change may exacerbate this problem, particularly among low-income and underserved older adults. Addressing this issue in public health and housing policy is essential to building climate-resiliency in this vulnerable population.\"  Published in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences, the study noted that lower temperatures cause blood vessels to constrict, which limits blood supply to the brain, increasing the risk of cognitive decline. Additionally, the body cells would work overtime to maintain the body heat, leaving less energy for the brain cells.   In contrast, in homes with higher temperatures, people would suffer from excess sweating and dehydration, which could disrupt the sleep cycle, leading to a higher risk of cognitive decline.  \"Our findings underscore the importance of how environmental factors like indoor temperature, impact cognitive health in aging populations,\" Dr Amir Baniassadi, a brain health expert and study lead author, concluded.  \"This research highlights the need for public health interventions and housing policies that prioritize climate resilience for older adults.

Compared  to  the  unaudited  financial  results  published on 19 February 2025, there are no differences in the financial results in the audited report. The consolidated sales revenue of Hepsor for the 2024 financial year amounted to 38.4 million euros  (2023: 41.1 million euros). The  Group's net profit in 2024 was 2.1 million euros (2023: 3.5 million euros). The net profit attributable to the owners of the parent company in the reporting year was 0.4 million euros (2023: 1.2 million euros). In  coordination  with  the  Group's  Supervisory  Board,  the  Management Board proposes to distribute 1,002 thousand euros (EUR 0.26 per share) in dividends to shareholders  in 2025 from the  profits of previous  periods. Based on the share price as of 31 December 2024, this results in a dividend yield of 6.2%. Development projects under construction and available for sale In 2024, we delivered 194 homes to customers- 165 in Tallinn and 29 in Riga. In  Riga,  at  Ulbrokas  34, we  started  the  construction of the StokOfiss 34 commercial  building  and  continued  the  construction  of  the  Annenhof  Maja residential  development with  40 apartments, which  will be  completed in early 2025. In  Tallinn,  we  began  Hepsor's  largest  development  project  to  date,  the construction  and sale of the main building of the former Baltic Cotton Spinning and Weaving Factory located at Manufaktuuri 5. The project is being developed in stages. In the first stage, the construction of 150 new apartments is planned. In  the commercial  building P113  Tervisemaja, owned  by the affiliated company Hepsor P113 O\\xDC, the signing of new rental contracts continued. As of 31 December 2024, 77% of  the building  was covered  by lease  agreements, whereas by today, agreements have been signed for 84% of the total rental space. Based on the Group's business strategy, the Lembitu 4 property in Tallinn, which is  intended to be used for the  construction of a hotel with approximately 110 rooms,   was  sold  in  Q4  2024. Freed-up  capital  was  used  to  finance  new developments as well as to reduce interest costs at the Group level. New projects in Tallinn and Riga In September 2024, Hepsor acquired a new property in Tallinn, at V\\xF5istluse 7. It is  a sLender-type apartment building, designed by researchers-architects at the Estonian  Academy of Arts,  built in the  style of an  early 20th century Lender wooden  house.  The  building  will  be  constructed  entirely of wood, with the exception  of the staircase in  the centre of the  building. At the heart of the project  is environmental preservation  and the utilisation  of green technology solutions for climate resilience. On  18 July 2024, Hepsor E18 SIA,  a subsidiary of Hepsor  Latvia O\\xDC, acquired a property  at Eizhenijas iela  18, in Riga. The  plan is to  develop two buildings there with a total of 54 apartments. In  December, Hepsor Latvia O\\xDC signed an option agreement to acquire a 50% stake in  a real  estate development  company. The  development company is planning to build 103 new homes at Dzelzavas 74c, in Riga. Hepsor in Canada To  date,  Hepsor  has  invested  in  five  development  projects in Toronto. In cooperation  with  business  partners,  the  primary  objective  of the projects acquired  in Canada's  largest city  is to  prepare a  detailed plan and thereby achieve building rights for a total of around 3,000 new rental apartments. In 2024, Hepsor made three new investments in Canada: -  a development project consisting of seven properties at 17-29 Glenavy Avenue, in Toronto; -  a development  project consisting  of 11 properties  in High Park, located in downtown Toronto; -  a development  project consisting  of 17 properties  on Brownville Avenue, in Toronto. Vision for the future In  2025, we  intend  to  begin  the  construction  and  sale  of up to five new development projects. In  Latvia, we  are planning  to begin  the construction  and sale of up to four projects.  In total, 227 new homes  will be built and  sold in three residential projects.  In the  field of  commercial buildings,  we would  like to  begin the construction  of a stock-office type development  project in the Veidema Quarter at Ganibu Dambis 17a. We  will also be starting the next phase  in the Manufaktuuri Quarter - the sale and construction of 49 new homes at Manufaktuuri 12. Nevertheless,  the declining interest rate environment  allows us to look to the future  with  moderate  optimism.  The  real  estate business is a long process. That's  why we want to initiate and develop new projects, always analysing risks and opportunities over market cycles.

This facility targets financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE) sector.  The facility forms a critical component of an ambitious initiative led by the African Development Bank Group and the World Bank Group, to provide electricity to 300 million Africans by 2030.  Africa faces a significant energy access challenge, with approximately 600 million people lacking electricity as of 2023. The continent is estimated to require an annual investment of nearly $25 billion to achieve universal energy access by 2030.  \"The Mission 300 Local Currency Guarantee Facility will encourage collaboration with African governments whilst leveraging concessional financing from the African Development Bank, the World Bank Group, and other development partners to scale the involvement of local banks in financing Distributed Renewable Energy solutions,\" said Wale Shonibare, Director for Energy Financial Solutions, Policy and Regulations at the African Development Bank. He is also a non-Executive Director with the Africa Guarantee Fund.  The fund has been at the forefront of bridging the financing gap facing green SMEs by steering the implementation of the Green Guarantee Facility, supported by the Nordic Development Fund and the Investment Fund for Developing Countries.  The Green Guarantee Facility has mobilized financing for green, clean, and renewable energy projects while positioning AGF as a leader in driving sustainable development in Africa. The Green Guarantee Facility mitigates risks within loan portfolios, lowering the exposure of financial institutions to defaults and enhancing their confidence in lending to distributed renewable energy SMEs. It has also accelerated electrification efforts, particularly in underserved rural and peri-urban communities.  By addressing systemic barriers such as high collateral requirements, currency mismatches, and the lack of long-term financing, AGF has been able to de-risk SME lending and mobilize significant private sector capital into Africa's energy transition.  With its proven track record in catalyzing SME financing while leveraging innovative guarantee solutions and capacity-building programs, the AGF is best positioned to advance Africa's energy transformation.  \"AGF's leadership in driving financial innovation for SMEs aligns seamlessly with the goals of Mission 300. By addressing financing gaps and fostering public-private partnerships, AGF plays a crucial role in driving inclusive energy solutions, accelerating the energy transition, and reducing carbon emissions across the continent,\" said Jules Ngankam, AGF Group CEO. \"We have successfully implemented the Green Guarantee, which has facilitated progress toward national commitments under the Africa Energy Declaration, the African Union's Vision 2063, and the global Sustainable Development Goals, fostering inclusive growth and climate resilience.\"  A recent example of AGF's impact in the energy sector is its participation in a credit guarantee syndication for a 40 MW solar plant in Madagascar. This landmark transaction demonstrated the viability of local currency financing for renewable energy projects in the country while enhancing power sector resilience through diversification away from thermal power. The project, which provides improved electricity access to approximately 285,000 people, supports both UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) and Goal 13 (climate action) by reducing emissions by 34,000 tonnes of CO2 through the displacement of thermal power.

The event, hosted at the GCA's Rotterdam Headquarters, called on governments, industries and civil society to redouble efforts to build \"resilient economies\" as the growth engine for the 21(st) century. Ambassadors and senior diplomatic representatives from 50 nations gathered in a show of support and unity for the adaptation and resilience agenda. Delegates committed to spurring sustainable growth, fostering new industries, driving innovation, and unlocking private finance to ease mounting pressures on development aid and public climate finance. The global market for climate adaptation solutions-such as advanced weather analytics, parametric insurance, and water-efficient infrastructure- is projected to be worth USD 2 trillion annually by 2026. Welcoming the attendees, Professor Patrick V. Verkooijen, President &amp; CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, lauded the diplomatic community for recognizing that adaptation is not merely a defensive measure but an essential component of global economic strategy: \"We are already in the 'Resilience Endgame'. We must prepare today for the 1.5-degree world. The devastating global impacts we see today need not define the society of tomorrow. The escape plan is to double down on adaptation and capture its incredible economic dividends.\" He added that \"the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, our flagship initiative, the largest adaptation program in the world, has shown us that growth and building resilience are intrinsically linked. But we can do so much more - together. Adaptation is about future-proofing our economies, protecting critical infrastructure, safeguarding food supplies, and ensuring that new opportunities can thrive in changing conditions. By rallying together, we multiply the impact of innovative investments and encourage the 'resilience dividend'-the powerful, compounding benefits that flow from forward-thinking action.\" Delivering remarks, Professor Jan Peter Balkenende, Former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Minister of State, and Executive Board Member of the GCA, emphasized that genuine progress on climate resilience will unlock broad-based dividends: \"What happens in the most vulnerable countries does not stay there. Climate change amplifies food insecurity, migration, and conflict. In fragile states, environmental stress can become a security threat. Europe and the world must take this seriously. Investing in resilience is not only right - it is wise.\" He added that \"This is why we need true global cooperation, based on shared interest and shared responsibility.\" Reflecting on adaptation efforts in Africa and beyond, H.E. Halima Mucheke, Ambassador of the Republic of Kenya in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, spoke about the significance of GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi: \"Kenya is proud to host the GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi which will intensify support for adaptation programs across Africa, leading these programs North-South. Around the world, resilient infrastructure is the hot new investment class. Climate adaptation is a framework for protecting infrastructure, securing food systems and creating new business and job opportunities. And it is being aided by a thriving market in climate solutions.\" He added that \"The continent's leading initiative in this area - the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP) - has already channelled more than $15bn to strengthen essential systems against climate shocks. These funds are helping to secure the adaptability and livelihoods of nearly 60 million vulnerable people in 40 countries. We need to keep scaling this up, working as a global community, North-South, South-South, South-North-all together.\" Following the opening remarks delegates also heard from the lead architect and founder of Powerhouse Company, Nanne de Ru, about how GCA's European headquarters at the Floating Office Rotterdam is an award-winning sustainable building recognized worldwide as a model for climate-resilient infrastructure. The reception forms part of GCA's broader advocacy strategy to advance climate adaptation solutions worldwide-focusing on protecting infrastructure, securing food systems, catalysing economic growth, and fostering global collaboration. By bringing together high-level diplomats, GCA reinforced its role as a leading international organisation in developing and implementing adaptation strategies that bolster economies against intensifying climate shocks.

The withdrawals have no expiration date, and prohibit all future oil and natural gas leasing in the areas withdrawn. President Biden first used this authority in January of 2021 when he restored protections for part of the Northern Bering Sea, and again in March 2023 to withdraw 2.8 million acres of the Beaufort Sea from future oil and gas leasing, which completed protections for the entire U.S. Arctic Ocean.  With this, Biden has taken action to protect the entire U.S. East coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and additional portions of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska from future oil and natural gas leasing, covering more than 625 million acres of the U.S. ocean.  The outgoing President has determined that the environmental and economic risks and harms that would result from drilling in these areas outweigh their limited fossil fuel resource potential, according to the White House.  Nearly 400 municipalities and more than 2,300 elected local, state, Tribal, and federal officials across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts have formally opposed the expansion of offshore drilling in these areas in view of its severe environmental, health, and economic threats.   Nearly every Governor along the East and West Coasts - Republicans and Democrats alike - has expressed concerns about expanded oil and gas drilling off their coastlines. In Alaska, the new Northern Bering Sea protections are consistent with a long-standing request from more than 70 coastal Tribes based on the need to help sustain a vital and threatened ocean area.  There are currently no active oil and natural gas leases in Federal waters off the eastern Atlantic coast. But when a time-limited withdrawal issued by the previous administration expire in 2032, it would open 334 million acres of the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) from Canada to the southern tip of Florida, and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling.   The Alaskan Congressional delegation had opposed previous proposals to allow oil and gas leasing and drilling in the remaining portion of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area in Alaska.   In a statement after issuing the Presidential Memoranda, Biden said, \"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, a man-made catastrophe that took the lives of eleven people and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is a solemn reminder of the costs and risks of offshore drilling to the health and resilience of our coasts and fisheries and underscores the importance of the legal protections I am putting in place today.\"     Copyright(c) 2025 RTTNews.com.

Funds come from public and private, domestic and international sources:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The largest source of domestic public finance is often taxes. Non-tax revenues include fees, rents and fines, as well as revenues from state-owned enterprises. Another source is domestic borrowing. Examples include the sale of government bonds and securities to domestic banks, pension funds, corporations and the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Domestic private finance encompasses all domestic investment and borrowing by private entities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">International public finance covers official development assistance (ODA), south-south cooperation (SSC) and foreign borrowing.</p><p>International private finance includes foreign direct investment (FDI) by private companies, portfolio investment, migrants' remittances to families and friends at home, international borrowing and philanthropic resources.</p><p>Climate finance</p><p>refers to financing that supports activities to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Instruments include carbon finance, risk insurance, catastrophe bonds, climate resilience funds and debt swaps. In 2009, at the 15th UN Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen, industrialised countries committed to collectively mobilising $ 100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. This target was reached in 2022. However, the financing gap for climate action remains significant, amounting to trillions of dollars. In addition, developing countries want international assistance for climate action to be additional to, but not a substitute for, development finance (ODA).</p><p>Official development assistance (ODA)</p><p>is financial assistance from public donors, including multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, provided to low- and middle-income countries to support development. Development sectors include health, education and infrastructure - but not, for example, the military. ODA consists of either grants or concessional loans, also known as 'soft' loans. The latter must contain a grant element of at least 10 % for middle-income countries and 45 % for low-income countries.</p><p>ODA is a robust but slowly growing source of development finance, reaching $ 223.3 billion in 2023. At 0.37 % of donor countries' gross national income (GNI), however, it remains far below the longstanding UN target of 0.7 %. Developing countries have long called for an increase in ODA to meet this target. There have also been concerns that a significant share of ODA has recently been allocated to Ukraine, leading to calls on donors to meet the other UN target of allocating at least 0.2 % of their gross national income (GNI) to the least developed countries.</p><p>Domestic resource mobilisation (DRM)</p><p>is by far the largest source of development finance. Efforts to increase domestic public resources include broadening the tax base, bringing the informal sector into the formal economy and strengthening tax policy and administration. To increase domestic resources on the private side, it is necessary to develop a domestic financial sector and build a domestic savings base. An enabling environment also needs to be created for investment in sustainable development, for example by improving transparency and implementing good governance, anti-corruption measures and the rule of law. In a globalised world, however, national efforts alone may not fully realise the potential of domestic resource mobilisation. They need to be backed up by international tax cooperation that ensures a fair distribution of taxes among countries and effectively combats tax evasion and avoidance.</p><p>Private sector (in development finance)</p><p>Private development finance encompasses both domestic and foreign private investment, including both equity and debt. With the exception of remittances, private finance is primarily profit oriented. However, it makes vital contributions to sustainable development. For instance, it creates jobs and increases economic growth and tax revenues - which in turn increase public development finance. The private sector can also invest directly in sectors that are relevant to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as agriculture, industry, technology, infrastructure and energy.</p><p>Blended finance</p><p>is the practice of using public or philanthropic finance as a catalyst to mobilise private-sector investment for sustainable development. Investments that would otherwise not be viable are made less risky and more attractive through public participation. Blending can take the form of concessional loans, first-loss capital, guarantees, insurance, technical assistance funds and design stage grants. There has been great hope that billions in public funding could leverage trillions in private capital through blending techniques. So far, however, this ambition has remained a dream: Blended finance only mobilised about $ 231 billion in capital for sustainable development in developing countries between 2015 and 2024, with a negligible share going to low-income countries.</p><p>International financial architecture (IFA)</p><p>is the set of international financial frameworks, rules, institutions and markets that has been put in place to ensure the stability and functioning of the global monetary and financial system. It includes the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the multilateral development banks (MDBs) and financial standard-setters such as the Bank for International Settlements, as well as creditor groups that address sovereign debt issues, such as the Paris Club. Reforming the IFA has been a focus of the financing for development process since 2002. This includes addressing the debt crisis, facilitating greater access to sufficient MDB financing, strengthening the global financial safety net through an inclusive and responsive IMF and improving the fairness and transparency of credit rating agencies.</p><p>Multilateral development banks (MDBs)</p><p>are international financial institutions set up by a group of countries to provide financing and expert advice in order to promote socio-economic development in low- and middle-income countries. They include the World Bank and regional development banks such as the African Development Bank. MDBs are a major source of concessional finance and have helped to finance projects in key sectors such as health, education and infrastructure. Due to their high credit ratings, MDBs can access capital from the commercial market at significantly lower interest rates than those available to most developing countries. MDB loans tend to have longer time horizons and are more likely to finance riskier projects than private investors. In addition, they provide counter-cyclical support, which means that they provide more financing during crises than they would otherwise. Collectively, the major MDBs disbursed some $ 96 billion in loans in 2022 alone.</p><p>Special drawing rights (SDRs)</p><p>are an interest-bearing international reserve asset created by the IMF in 1969 to help member countries in times of economic difficulty. The SDR value is based on a basket of five currencies - the dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen and the British pound sterling. There have only been four general allocations: in 1970-72, 1979-81, 2009 and 2021. In the most recent allocation, the IMF approved a general allocation of about SDR 456 billion, equivalent to $ 650 billion, to increase global liquidity during the Covid-19 pandemic. SDR allocations are distributed in proportion to member countries' quota shares in the IMF. However, IMF quota shares are so heavily dominated by richer countries that low-income countries have received only about $ 21 billion (3.2 %) of the recent SDR allocations. Nevertheless, even these SDRs proved beneficial to LICs, while many richer countries had no need to use their allocations. To redress the unequal allocation of SDRs, richer countries have channelled or donated more than $ 100 billion of their unused SDRs to developing countries. Any country using its SDRs has to pay interest, albeit at lower rates than those available to developing countries on the commercial market.</p><p>Debt distress and debt insolvency</p><p>Borrowing is an important way for governments to finance investments in growth and development. However, it is also important for them to ensure that they can continue to service their debt - that is, to maintain a sustainable debt burden. A country is said to be in debt distress when it faces difficulties in meeting its debt obligations. Indicators include missed payments or arrears. If the situation deteriorates, a country enters debt insolvency: It cannot meet its obligations even with policy adjustments. Unlike debt distress, where repayment is still possible with external support, debt insolvency suggests that debt relief or restructuring is inevitable. According to the International Monetary Fund, by 2024, more than 50 % of low-income countries were either at high risk of debt distress or already in debt distress, with 25 % of middle-income countries also being at high risk.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["International private finance includes foreign direct investment (FDI) by private companies, portfolio investment, migrants' remittances to families and friends at home, international borrowing and philanthropic resources.

At the meeting, scheduled to be held at 4.30 PM at the White House, the two leaders will discuss \"a wide range of pressing international issues - including our ongoing support for Ukraine, and the urgent need for a ceasefire deal and the release of all hostages in the Middle East\", 10 Downing Street said in a press release.   The session will focus on strategy and how progress can be made towards long-term solutions for both conflicts.  This marks Starmer's first visit to the U.S. after he became the Prime Minister in July.  It follows UK Foreign Secretary and US Secretary of State's visit to Kyiv this week, where they heard directly from President Zelenskyy about Ukraine's current position in the fight against Russia.   Starmer left for Washington as Russia announced that it is expelling six British diplomats after revoking their accreditation, accusing them of spying.  The meeting is also expected to touch on a wider range of global issues, including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific and strengthening US-UK co-operation to secure supply chains and increase climate resilience.

The pledge recognised the key role Indigenous Peoples play in protecting the planet's lands and forests. How have you experienced this process?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was at COP26 for the announcement of the $ 1.7 billion fund. I applauded, spoke to heads of state and felt that indigenous voices were finally being heard. Finally, it was understood that there are no 'donors' and 'recipients' of finance, but rather that it is a question of a financial collaboration in which one part contributes financial resources and the other part protects natural resources. But at COP28, reports revealed that only about two percent of the almost $ 500 million spent by the end of 2022 had actually reached indigenous communities. I was shocked. The rest had gone to international NGOs, UN agencies and governments, where a lot of funding gets lost in bureaucracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The situation has only slightly improved, with about 10 % directly reaching Indigenous Peoples' communities in 2023. Why is the money not getting to the people on the ground?</p><p>The institutions that receive the funding think that only they know what needs to be done. Instead of supporting indigenous leadership, they sideline indigenous communities with bureaucratic barriers and claims that they need 'capacity building'. This reflects a profound lack of trust and understanding. We don't need capacity building: We need resources to restore nature, which we have been doing for generations. We are the world's best conservationists. Instead, institutions should build their capacity to understand and support indigenous-led solutions. To this end, I prepared a report on the financial needs of Indigenous Peoples, which was presented to the 23rd Session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2024 and adopted by the UN's Economic and Social Council. We have also developed guidelines for funding indigenous communities directly, without intermediaries. These documents highlight how funding should be structured to truly support indigenous-led action.</p><p>Why is direct funding to Indigenous Peoples so important?</p><p>First, development and climate finance should support real action - and Indigenous Peoples are the ones driving climate action on the ground. Because their lives are deeply connected to nature, they are constantly innovating and creating solutions for climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation. They protect land, forests, grasslands and oceans. Second, to achieve equity and inclusion, we must invest in those who need it most. Whether in the Nordic region, the Americas, New Zealand or the developing world, Indigenous Peoples still lack access to basic services such as education, healthcare, shelter and clean water. My community in Chad, the pastoralist Mbororo People, have to drink from rivers and lakes, there is no nearby healthcare, and access to education is difficult.</p><p>Can you give an example of how Indigenous Peoples are building community adaptation and resilience?</p><p>In Chad, we are combining traditional knowledge with science. We use satellite images and geographical data to create participatory maps. The community itself identifies and monitors areas of environmental degradation and species loss and designs restoration plans, such as replanting trees and restoring water sources with their ancestral knowledge to build local adaptation and resilience.</p><p>You're not the only one to complain that funds are not being used effectively. What are the flaws in current climate finance?</p><p>Many funds, including the $ 1.7 billion, target only specific areas within specific countries. For example, they may be limited to the tropical forests of the Congo Basin within the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To give you an idea of its scale, the entire Congo Basin spans 11 countries! This approach ignores the interconnectedness of ecosystems. Nature has no borders. Protecting one part while neglecting another destroys the balance. In Chad, we have deserts in the north, savannah in the centre and tropical forests in the south. Climate change is forcing people and animals to migrate from north to south in search of water and food. If you want to protect the balance in the tropical forest, you also have to protect the savannah.</p><p>How should an effective funding mechanism be designed, and can you give an example?</p><p>The most effective funding I've received has been through awards. I received the Pritzker Emerging Environmental Genius Award from the University of California in 2019, followed by the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2021 and the Diane von Frstenberg Award in 2022. As the prize money was not tied to rigid conditions, it allowed me to take risks and adapt my projects as needed. For example, I won the Rolex Award for a participatory mapping project in Chad and Niger. We worked with an organisation in Niger and made great progress. But when the political crisis hit, I couldn't continue. Instead of pressuring me to deliver, my partners helped me move the project to another region in Chad. This kind of flexibility is crucial for indigenous-led projects to succeed.</p><p>Despite this setback, did the project achieve its objectives?</p><p>Even more than that, we actually brought about a historic change: For the first time, women in my community were given the right to land. This was unprecedented. They started to cultivate the land and got access to markets and income.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>It was an outcome of the participatory mapping process: Once the maps had been drawn, the communities came together to develop a plan for stronger adaptation and mitigation measures. During these discussions, we realised that women needed to contribute to the effort but lacked land rights. In our customary system, land, territories and resources are governed by traditional law, and chiefs have authority over large areas of land. So, the chiefs decided to give part of it to 233 women for collective farming. After they had started to farm the land, they raised another problem: Many of their children weren't going to school. We applied for permission, the community built a boarding house, and now more than 100 children are in school. This has happened simply because the women were given land to work. In 20 years, these children will be the next leaders - this is how real, lasting change begins. The project has even inspired the chiefs of two other communities to allocate some of their communal land to women. Imagine if even a fraction of the $ 1.7 billion pledged to Indigenous Peoples were spent in this way. The impact could be enormous! When funding is flexible, responsive and adapted to people's needs, it can work magic.</p><p>Direct funding to Indigenous Peoples is often limited to smaller amounts. Does this make sense?</p><p>With small, symbolic amounts of $ 10-15,000, we will never achieve real solutions. We need trust, risk tolerance and direct investment - and if we fail along the way, funding institutions and Indigenous Peoples can learn and do better. Those who manage global funds claim to know better, but if their approach worked, we wouldn't be facing such severe deforestation and increasing climate disasters around the world. They are the ones who don't manage money effectively.</p><p>Let's look at the international situation: The US is planning to withdraw from international organisations, and ODA is in a downward spiral. What's your view on this?</p><p>This is deeply unfair. Western nations seem to forget how they got rich in the first place: Europe and the US built their wealth on the exploitation of natural resources from other countries, which is our common capital. They drove the climate change that we are now suffering, especially those that rely directly on nature. Yet they pretend that the money they're giving to developing countries is charity. It isn't, it's justice. But in the end, they will pay the price: Cutting funding won't save them.</p><p>In what sense?</p><p>Do they really think they can protect themselves by hoarding their wealth? They can build walls, they can isolate themselves, but there is only one atmosphere. Pollution in Europe and the US is far worse than in many developing countries. In Chad, we can still go to our forests and breathe fresh air, while in Berlin, Paris, New York or Washington the air is toxic. My point is: Investing in the global south is investing in their own survival. The healthiest ecosystems, the greatest biodiversity, the last remaining untouched lands are in our territories. What's more: If the western nations stop climate finance, they will lose any moral standing to tell developing countries how to manage their resources.</p><p>Are rich nations compromising their credibility?</p><p>The nations that preached democracy and human rights to the world are silently withdrawing. They created international organisations like the UN, but now they are retreating from commitments and responsibilities. If they don't respect their own rules and principles, how can they expect anyone else to?</p><p>Against this backdrop, what do you expect from the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4)?</p><p>It is an opportunity to redefine the meaning of social development and debt, which has been shaped by the so-called developed world. Instead of just talking about developing countries' financial debt, we need to talk about the ecological debt developed nations owe us for the damage they have done to the planet. We should no longer allow them to dictate the terms but must hold them to account when they renege on their own promises and withdraw funding from the very countries that need it most. FfD4 is a chance for developing and developed countries to talk as equals and for the people who are doing the work on the ground to be part of the conversation.</p><p>Indigenous Peoples must be in the room when high-level negotiations on treaties, agreements and declarations on development take place. I call on all leaders at this conference to think hard about how to transform the global economy, how to make our world fairer and more just and to come to the table with ideas that are workable and realistic.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Why is direct funding to Indigenous Peoples so important?

Encouragingly, the bottom of the market in terms of transaction activity  remained backward-looking until 2023. Despite  the market situation, a significant  number of new homes were handed  over to customers in 2024, a large number  of  new  leases  were  signed,  vacancy  rates  in both existing and new commercial  buildings were reduced, new investments were made in the Baltics and in Canada. It would probably have been more profitable in the short term for the Group  to  make  fewer  new  investments,  thereby  saving  on both interest and overhead costs. However, the development project cycle is known to last at least 3-5 years,  and  therefore  the  Group  has  continued  to invest and expand its development  portfolio in a forward-looking manner, even in a difficult economic environment. The Group's consolidated sales revenue for the 4th quarter of 2024 was 10.5 million  euros (Q4 of  2023: 5.1 million euros) and  the consolidated sales revenue  of the  reporting year  totaled 38.4 million  euros (2023: 41.1 million euros). The  Group's net  profit for  the 4th quarter  was 1 million euros (Q4 2023: net loss  1.3 million euros), incl. the net profit attributable to the owners of the parent  company was 0.6 million euros (Q4  2023: net loss 1.1 million euros) and the  Group's net profit in 2024 was 2.1 million euros (2023: 3.5 million euros). The net profit attributable to the owners of the parent company in the reporting year was 0.4 million euros (2023: 1.2 million euros). Development projects under construction and available for sale In  2024, we delivered 193 homes to customers,  including 51 homes in the fourth quarter. We delivered 165 homes to clients in Tallinn, and 28 homes in Riga. In  2024, we began  the construction  of a  commercial building  StokOfiss 34 at Ulbrokas 34, Riga. In  Tallinn,  we  began  Hepsor's  largest  development  project  to  date,  the construction  and sale of the main building of the former Baltic Cotton Spinning and Weaving Factory located at Manufaktuuri 5. The project is being developed in stages. In the first stage, the construction of 152 new apartments is planned. In  Riga, construction continued on  the 40 apartment Annenhof House development project, the completion of which is planned for the beginning of 2025. In  the commercial  building P113  Tervisemaja, owned  by the affiliated company Hepsor P113 O\\xDC, the signing of new rental contracts continued, and as at the end of the reporting year 77% of the rental space was covered by contracts. Based on the Group's business strategy, the Lembitu 4 property in Tallinn, which is  intended to be used for the  construction of a hotel with approximately 110 rooms,   was  sold  in  Q4  2024. Freed-up  capital  was  used  to  finance  new developments as well as to reduce interest costs at the Group level. New projects in Tallinn and Riga In September 2024, Hepsor acquired a new property in Tallinn, at V\\xF5istluse 7. It is  a sLender-type apartment building, designed by researchers-architects at the Estonian  Academy of Arts,  built in the  style of an  early 20th century Lender wooden  house.  The  building  will  be  constructed  entirely of wood, with the exception  of the staircase in  the centre of the  building. At the heart of the project  is environmental preservation  and the utilisation  of green technology solutions for climate resilience. On  18 July 2024, Hepsor E18 SIA,  a subsidiary of Hepsor  Latvia O\\xDC, acquired a property  at Eizhenijas iela  18, in Riga. The  plan is to  develop two buildings there with a total of 54 apartments. In  December, Hepsor Latvia O\\xDC signed an option agreement to acquire a 50% stake in  a real  estate development  company. The  development company is planning to build 103 new homes at Dzelzavas 74c, in Riga. Hepsor in Canada To  date,  Hepsor  has  invested  in  five  development  projects in Toronto. In cooperation  with  business  partners,  the  primary  objective  of the projects acquired  in Canada's  largest city  is to  prepare a  detailed plan and thereby achieve building rights for a total of around 3,000 new rental apartments. In 2024, Hepsor made three new investments in Canada: -  a development project consisting of seven properties at 17-29 Glenavy Avenue, in Toronto; -  a development  project consisting  of 11 properties  in High Park, located in downtown Toronto; -  a development  project consisting  of 17 properties  on Brownville Avenue, in Toronto. Vision for the future In  2025, we  intend  to  begin  the  construction  and  sale  of up to five new development projects. In  Latvia, we  are planning  to begin  the construction  and sale of up to four projects.  In total, 147 new homes  will be built and  sold in three residential projects.  In the  field of  commercial buildings,  we would  like to  begin the construction of a stock-office type development project in the Veidema Quarter. We  will also be starting the next phase  in the Manufaktuuri Quarter - the sale and construction of 49 new homes at Manufaktuuri 12. Nevertheless,  the declining interest rate environment  allows us to look to the future  with  moderate  optimism.  The  real  estate business is a long process. That's  why we want to initiate and develop new projects, always analysing risks and opportunities over market cycles.

The event brought  together leading minds from academia and finance  to  explore  actionable  strategies  for aligning economic systems with environmental sustainability while addressing pressing societal concerns. The  event, titled \"Macroeconomics  and Climate,\" featured  a keynote lecture by Associate  Professor Andrea Chiavari  and a panel  discussion titled \"Sustaining Sustainability:  Balancing Economic Growth and Climate Resilience,\" moderated by Associate  Professor Banu  Demir Pakel.  Panellists included  Dr. Nicola Ranger, Director  of the Global Finance Group  of the Environmental Change Institute and Senior  Research Fellow at Oxford, and David Barrett, CEO of EBC Financial Group (UK)  Ltd. Together,  they dissected  the intersection  of policy,  finance, and human impact, offering practical insights and recommendations that extend beyond theoretical discourse.

As the official Foreign Exchange  Partner of FC Barcelona and a partner of the United Nations' United to Beat Malaria campaign, EBC is committed to  shaping a future defined by  sustainability, equity, and responsible trading practices. EBC's  participation in WERD reflects the  growing urgency of bridging financial markets  and academic  research to  address climate  and economic challenges. By contributing  to  a  shared  dialogue  on  actionable  strategies,  EBC joined a community  of thought leaders in highlighting practical steps to align financial systems with sustainable development goals. Can We Grow the Economy and Save the Planet? At  the  core  of  the  discussions  was  the  recognition  that  financial  and environmental  security are universally shared  concerns. Dr. Chiavari delivered an  eye-opening keynote on the economic  costs of climate change. He illustrated the  dramatic growth of global GDP  since the industrial revolution, juxtaposing this  with  the  environmental  toll  of  fossil fuel consumption and rising CO2 emissions.  Chiavari highlighted the  critical importance of  the social cost of carbon in shaping effective policies. Central  to his  message was  the concept  of the  social cost  of carbon, which quantifies the broader societal costs of emissions. \"Carbon taxation is not just an  environmental necessity but also an economic one,\" he asserted. Dr. Chiavari explained how such measures could create the economic incentives needed to steer both corporations and individuals toward sustainable choices. \"Well, think again yourself,\" Chiavari added. \"Turning on the radiator, your benefit is the same as before-having a warmer room. But now your cost is much higher than before.\" Expanding  on  this  point,  Dr.  Chiavari  emphasised  that  carbon taxation is designed  to  target  carbon  emissions  rather  than energy consumption itself. \"Carbon  taxation taxes  carbon, it  doesn't tax  energy,\" he  explained. \"So it creates huge incentives for the private sector, for people, for you, for us, for me,  to move from fossil  fuels to alternative sources  of energy. It's not just about  reducing energy or  output; it creates  huge incentives to switch towards alternative energy sources.\" Building  on  this  foundation,  the  panel  discussion  delved  deeper into the practicalities of aligning economic growth with climate resilience, moderated by Dr. Banu Demir Pakel. Bridging Policy, Finance, and Action Through a Panel of Perspectives The  panel discussion explored the complex interplay between economic growth and climate   resilience.   Each   panellist   brought  distinct  expertise  to  the conversation,  offering fresh  perspectives on  how global  systems can adapt to these twin imperatives. Dr.  Chiavari  emphasised  the  global  nature  of  addressing  climate  change, highlighting   that  emissions  transcend  borders  and  require  a  coordinated international  response.  He  discussed  the  risks  of  carbon  leakage,  where stringent  climate  policies  in  one  country  could  lead  to  emissions being displaced  to  regions  with  weaker  regulations, ultimately undermining global progress.  To  mitigate  this,  Chiavari  advocated  for  policies  that  foster international   collaboration  and  innovation,  ensuring  that  transitions  to sustainable practices are both equitable and comprehensive. Dr.  Ranger highlighted the economic opportunities  that can emerge from climate action,  stating,  \"This  is  not  just  about costs, it's about opportunities.\" Articulating  the potential to  create jobs and  stimulate economic growth while addressing  climate risks, Dr. Ranger also  stressed the importance of reshaping public  narratives.  She  underscored  that  effective climate action can foster innovation  and progress  without imposing  a significant  financial burden. She also  advocates for redirecting  fossil fuel and  other environmentally damaging subsidies,  which globally amount  to up to  $7 trillion annually, towards green investments, such as renewable energy. Leveraging his extensive experience in financial markets, Barrett emphasised the importance  of aligning market incentives with sustainability goals. He shared a frank  assessment  of  the  sector's  challenges  in  embracing  sustainability, underscoring  the profit-driven nature of financial institutions: \"The financial market  is driven by the need to  make money-whether that's for its shareholders or  investors.\" Barrett highlighted the critical  need for governments to create enforceable  regulatory frameworks, noting  that this alignment  is essential to channel the sector's influence towards meaningful climate action. On  the topic of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks, Barrett expressed  concern over their current implementation,  noting, \"ESG has become a tick-box  exercise.\" He called for  stronger policies that ensure accountability and deliver measurable impact, rather than simply meeting superficial compliance standards. During  a  discussion  on  climate  \"clubs\",  Barrett  highlighted  the risks of fragmented global efforts. He cautioned, \"For these initiatives to succeed, they need  to include all major players. Otherwise, the emissions reductions achieved in  some regions  could be  offset by  increased emissions  elsewhere.\" This, he warned,  could undermine  the collective  progress necessary  to address climate challenges. What  Practical Steps  Should Governments,  Businesses, and  Individuals Take to Build  a  Sustainable  Economic  Future  That  Feels  Attainable  and Secure for Everyone? Separately,  the moderator  and panellists  were interviewed  to expand  on this crucial  question, providing diverse perspectives  on the collaborative roles of governments, businesses, and individuals in addressing climate challenges. The Role of Governments: Policies and Planning Dr.  Demir  Pakel  emphasised  the  importance  of  education  and  awareness in addressing  climate  change,  particularly  the  role  of governments in driving change.  \"The  government's  role  is  to  start with increasing awareness,\" she explained,  stressing the  need for  early education  about the  consequences of climate  change. She highlighted the need for policies that not only incentivise the  private sector but  also guide consumer  behaviour, noting, \"It's a complex network  where  governments  hold  the  primary  responsibility for planning and guiding action at every level.\" \"The private sector needs incentives to be able to take action because they will definitely  look  shorter-term  compared  to  the  government.  Therefore, their behaviour needs to be changed, and the government has another role: implementing policies  to change the behaviour of both the private sector and consumers,\" she added. Market Incentives and Carbon Taxation Dr.  Chiavari reinforced the need for government-led interventions, particularly through  carbon taxation,  as a  means to  correct market failures. He explained that  by  incorporating  the  societal  cost  of  emissions  into energy prices, governments can encourage more responsible consumption and investment decisions. Changing the Narrative: A Positive Transition Dr. Ranger reflected on the current challenges in climate action, echoing that a significant  part of the problem lies in awareness. \"At the moment, something is going  wrong, and I think a lot of that is about the awareness side,\" she noted. \"Governments  play a role, but the government fundamentally does what the public will  vote for.  And a  lack of  awareness of  the immediate benefits of a green energy  transition-for energy security and public health-is a key problem at the moment.\" Ranger  criticised that the  narrative surrounding climate  change has failed in recent  years by framing it as  a costly and burdensome challenge. \"Particularly the  narrative is this  is going to  cost a lot  of money to  deal with. I don't agree  with that view and it is not supported by the evidence. You know, we have to  make hard  decisions, but  what we  know is  that right  now the  way we are approaching  this is  making it  harder-specifically, a  lack of  certainty from government  on its policies  stalls investment and  increases the costs. All the evidence  shows that if we get the right  policies in place and set a clear path for  investors, a just  transition is both  the lowest cost  and more beneficial pathway,\" she said. Pointing  to fossil fuel subsidies, she  highlighted how their redirection could catalyse  a positive  transition. \"Globally,  we pump  so much money into fossil fuel  subsidies-estimates range from  five to seven  trillion dollars a year. If you  stopped that and put  it into clean technologies,  we would have solved the problem.\" To  address this, Ranger called for a shift in public discourse to emphasise the economic  opportunities inherent  in climate  action. She  stressed the  role of academics  and experts in reshaping the narrative, saying, \"We need to make sure people understand this is a positive transition. Through good government policy, the  impact on individuals will not be  significant and would actually boost job growth and innovation.\" Ranger  concluded  by  urging  governments  to  take  the  lead in changing this narrative,  saying, \"What I'd  really like to  see is governments getting behind this  and saying, 'Look, this  is what's going to  happen. It's going to benefit you. Here is the pathway. This is what both investors and the public need.'\" The Role of Businesses and Individuals: Accountability and Innovation Barrett  provided a candid perspective on the role of businesses and individuals in  climate action. He highlighted  the financial sector's profit-driven nature, cautioning   that  it  would  not  lead  sustainability  efforts  without  clear regulatory frameworks. \"Financial markets will not do it on their own. They need to  be incentivised to act,\" he stated. \"Once the financial sector is pointed in a  direction and gets  enthusiastic about a  topic, it can accomplish incredible things, but it requires clear policy and incentives to get there.\" Barrett  also  reflected  on  the  role  of individuals as voters and consumers, stressing  that their choices  can significantly influence  policy and corporate behaviour.  \"Policy needs to be much better at educating the voter about what it wants and how it should expect that to come about,\" he remarked. By prioritising sustainable  practices  and  holding  policymakers  accountable, individuals can drive systemic change. While  critical  of  superficial  measures  such  as  \"tick-box\" ESG frameworks, Barrett  maintained an optimistic outlook on  the potential of finance. \"Finance can  be incredibly innovative,\" he noted. \"It  can move mountains and solve real problems,  but  it  needs  the  right  incentives and honest conversations about what's  at stake.\"  He called  for a  shift from  short-term political cycles to forward-looking  strategies, urging  all stakeholders  to embrace  the long-term effort required to address the climate crisis effectively.

Debt levels kept soaring while international interest rates rose fast. There was reason to fear widespread sovereign defaults.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A catastrophic wave of defaults was avoided, so there was no systemic global crisis. Emerging market bond spreads are back to pre-pandemic levels. It means that interest rates are not dramatically higher than those of advanced economies, which is a sign of growing investor confidence. In recent months, Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya and Senegal have been able to issue new bonds. Since 2022, the number of sovereign defaults and requests for comprehensive debt relief has gone down. The last relevant application was Ghana's in 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It helps, of course, that the Federal Reserve and other leading central banks started to cut interest rates since March 2024. Lower interest rates mean more favourable financial conditions for countries with low and middle incomes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nonetheless, debt relief or at least liquidity relief will be needed in some low-income countries with deeply entrenched debt issues. Serious problems do indeed persist. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), around 15 % of low-income countries are still in debt distress and another 40 % are at high risk of such distress.</p><p>Not only default spells trouble</p><p>Even when a country does not default, debt problems tend to stifle its development. Even if the economy is still growing, national budgets stay strained because of unexpectedly high interest-costs and increasingly unstable exchange rates. Moreover, illiquid debtors are at risk of default even if they are solvent in principle. That means they may become unable to fulfil an obligation in time even though they would be able to do so with some delay.</p><p>Helping countries that are at risk of a liquidity squeeze but have sustainable debt levels should now be a priority. Failure to act fast and effectively now means more difficult and more expensive action will become necessary in the future. Solving the problems fast will facilitate investments and growth. Continuous insufficient debt rollovers always require long negotiations and come at huge economic and social prices.</p><p>According to IMF data of late 2023, the median low-income country was devoting over 14 % of its revenue to servicing foreign debt. A decade ago, the share had been only six percent. The IMF reckoned that these countries' near-term debt repayments would reach approximately $ 60 billion per year. From 2010 to 2020, the annual average was $ 20 billion. These figures mean that poverty cannot be tackled and building climate resilience looks utopian.</p><p>A growth-focused approach is urgently needed. Low-income countries cannot tackle adverse shocks the way that advanced economies do. In the Lehman Brothers crisis (2008-2009) or during the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021), high-income countries responded with temporary expansionary policies that were funded with massive borrowing and reversed once stabilisation was achieved. Moreover, social-protection systems reduce the down-ward spiral that the loss of wages means. Low-income countries lack those means to escape crises.</p><p>Valid steps in the right direction</p><p>The good news is that the international community is making progress regarding how to handle excessive sovereign debt. In November 2020, the G20 adopted its Common Framework for Debt Treatments (CF). It is a multilateral mechanism for restructuring and forgiving excessive sovereign debt. It does not suffice for resolving all current issues, but it has positive features:</p><p>It is creating a coordinated multilateral debt renegotiation framework at a time in which the geopolitical system is fragmenting.</p><p>It involves all relevant private, statal and multilateral creditors rather than only the Paris Club which represents the bilateral creditors of the established economic powers like the G7. China and other emerging-markets creditors are involved in the CF. That is a fundamental step in the right direction. Building trust and agreeing on rules among so many different types of creditors is difficult, of course, and will take time.</p><p>The CF is a fundamentally sound initiative given that the international community has been unwilling to define a legally binding mechanism to handle sovereign debt problems. In this setting, the CF is a valid second-best soft-law approach. At this point, no alternative is in sight.</p><p>The CF can and should be developed further. So far, it only applies to low-income countries, though some middle-income countries are struggling with serious problems too. Moreover, it would make sense, for example, to add a mechanism to provide temporary liquidity relief to countries in need. A clear and fast liquidity channel would allow those countries to avoid the stigma of debt restructuring and stimulate participation.</p><p>Decisive progress depends on cooperation of Paris Club donors with emerging markets, and especially China (see box). It is difficult in a period of polarisation, but the fact that the CF exists and is developing reasonably shows that it is possible.</p><p>Picking up speed</p><p>CF procedures are slow, but they are gradually picking up speed. Negotiating Ghana's agreement took roughly half the time it took for Chad's in 2021 and Zambia's in 2022.</p><p>Though the CF does not formally apply to them, the cases of the middle-income countries Suriname and Sri Lanka were dealt with according to its rules too. Sri Lanka was the second case, and it proceeded faster than the first.</p><p>The general trend is that parties are becoming more familiar with the process. They increasingly know what to expect, are building trust and learning to overcome stumbling blocks. Approval in principle for programmes will soon enable the IMF to disburse support as it receives the required financing assurances, but before every detail is hammered out.</p><p>In 2023, the G20 established the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) in cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank. It is a useful forum for discussing technical issues, methodologies and implementation issues. As in the CF, all relevant parties are involved.</p><p>In another important step, the CF has embraced the principle of comparable treatment of commercial and bilateral lenders from the Paris Club as well as non-Paris-Club countries. However, a clear definition of 'comparability' that would suit all restructuring models has not been found yet.</p><p>Private bondholders are an increasingly important group of creditors. So far, however, they were only brought in at the end of CF debt negotiations. The big challenge is that none of the three principal creditor groups likes to proceed with its own settlement without knowing what terms the debtor agrees with the other groups. The GSDR should address that official and private creditor processes move in parallel.</p><p>Progress is being made, but more is needed - and the faster it happens, the better. The CF is useful, but not really fit for purpose yet. A core challenge is that countries that need CF support often hesitate to apply for it. The reasons include that they are not assured that they will get significant debt restructuring or renewed access to financial markets. Moreover, there is a stigma attached to turning to creditors and asking for a renegotiation of loan conditions.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["The IMF reckoned that these countries' near-term debt repayments would reach approximately $ 60 billion per year.

A new report (<url normalizedValue=\"https://resilience.eurelectric.org/\">https://resilience.eurelectric.org/</url>) from industry body Eurelectric documents the amplitude and acceleration of extreme weather impacts on the power sector. In July 2021, floods in Belgium and Germany resulted in 200 000 customer outages. During the winter 2021-2022, storms in the UK and Ireland led to over one million households being without power.</p><p>The latest COP brought the need for climate adaptation to the attention of world leaders. The power sector is already acting and investing now to avoid higher costs later. Such investment is needed in the entire system: both in grids and generation assets.</p><p>Eurelectric Secretary General Kristian Ruby said:</p><p>\"Adaptation to climate change and extreme weather has become a big challenge for power companies. Climate-related resilience is a growing component of utilities' investment strategies and requires all actors to act together: utilities but also policymakers and other sectors which are critical during extreme weather events, such as telecommunications.\"</p><p>The need for grid investments amounts to some EUR400 billion by 2030, out of which 8% (EUR32 billion) would be for resilience. This share is set to grow as the world is not on track for the 1.5\u00b0C scenario. However, this cost should be partly balanced out by the increase of cheaper renewables lowering energy prices.</p><p>Investments need clear signals and political directions. The report thereby recommends to:</p><p>- Better coordinate actions of all power system actors (utilities, regulators,   and grid operators); - Promote a Resilience Incentive Mechanism to pursue adaptation measures and   remunerate system operators' digital investments; - Consider the electricity market design effects on resilience; - Reorganise climate adaptation EU funding.</p><p>The report will be launched at the digital event The Coming Storm - Building electricity resilience to extreme weather (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eurelectric.org/events/th\">https://www.eurelectric.org/events/th</url> e-coming-storm-building-electricity-resilience-to-extreme-weather/) on 7 December at 15.00 CET.</p><p>Note to Editors:</p><p>Eurelectric (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eurelectric.org/\">https://www.eurelectric.org/</url>) represents the interests of the European electricity industry.

Zambia's government has been making efforts to provide access to everyone, but much remains to be done. The national average access rate is only 31 %. The figure for urban areas is 67 %, but only four percent in rural ones. According to the governmental Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), electricity demand is growing by an annual three percent.</p><p>By the end of June last year, Zambia's national electricity capacity stood at slightly above 3800 MW. That was not quite 15 % more than 12 months earlier. The increase was due to new power generation facilities.</p><p>Hydropower is of crucial relevance in Zambia, accounting for about 83 % of generation capacity. However, drought reduces those capacities. At this point, we have eight hours of load-shedding every day. Moreover, the Zambian Electricity Company is forecast to lose revenues worth the equivalent of $ 35 million.</p><p>Failing electricity supply can start a domino effect in the economy. Many businesses are set to experience significant disruption of their operations. Power outages interrupt production and diminish productivity. Some businesses will have to incur additional costs to sustain operations, for example, when they buy fuel for small-scale generators.</p><p>Food price inflation</p><p>The cost of living is set to increase across the nation moreover, not least because the drought is hurting farms. Food becomes more expensive when less food is produced. The staple crop, maize, is of particular concern. Rising prices strain household budgets, especially for low-income families. Their food security is at risk and poverty is getting worse.</p><p>At the same time, Zambia's debt situation remains difficult in spite of the reforms undertaken by the government. Its compromise with creditors means important payments have been postponed and interest rates reduced. That means that immediate debt services have declined by about 40 %, creating more fiscal space. That enhanced space is nonetheless still too small in view of the harsh ecological crisis the country is suffering.

Extension of multi-year agreement that started in 2018, focusing on five strategic projects across the globe.   By 2026, ambitious target to recover over 300 thousand hectares of degraded land in Cerrado Brazil and regenerate agricultural soils in China with a focus to impact the agricultural sector for the adaption of sustainable farming practices. In the US the focus lies in enhancing climate resilience of crop land  Collaboration and innovation drive the transformation of agriculture into a climate solution that regenerates soil and nature.  23 May 2024, Basel, Switzerland / Arlington, Virginia, USA Syngenta Group, the leading global agriculture technology company, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a world-wide conservation organization with the mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends, today renewed their successful collaboration that links conservation goals with economic potential and addresses societal issues like deforestation and land degradation. The two partners have been collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration in 2018.  The new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects and focuses on further advancing business practices with the goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China, and the United States.  The collaboration embodies Syngenta?s commitment to regenerate soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide  announced in April 2024. Petra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: ?We are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight climate change and safeguard natural resources.? Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China and the US Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with the company.  The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when expanding their production, instead of clearing native vegetation. The REVERTE\u00ae program, originally designed by Syngenta and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential, includes Ita\u00fa BBA bank as the organization offering a line of credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria. Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater Systems, TNC: ?REVERTE\u00ae aims to demonstrate, through an integrated solution involving good agricultural practices, financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic viability of\u00a0restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits, increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits today and in the future.?  As of March 2024, REVERTE\u00ae has garnered commitments from over 263 farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome. China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17 thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m3 per hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group?s fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta Group?s recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to 1000 by 2028. United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing cropland?s climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers. Syngenta Group supports a broad range of sustainability projects and partners with academia and industry around the world ? demonstrating its commitment to a collaborative approach.  Syngenta Group and TNC will hold a LinkedIn Live event on the partnership progress. Tzutzuy Ramirez and Roberto Castro, Syngenta, and Michael Wironen and Rodrigo Spuri, TNC, will discuss how the partners will continue to develop their unique NGO-corporation collaboration model and what the plans are for the future.

AFFO excluding trading profits demonstrated resilience, up\u00a00.2%  Statutory net loss after tax of $1,583.8 million, compared to a statutory net loss after tax of $752.7\u00a0million in FY23, primarily driven by greater unrealised fair valuation losses on investment property in FY24 compared to FY23  Pro forma gearing (look-through) remains prudent at 32.0%, toward the lower end of the 30-40% target range despite the impact of valuation declines. 92% of debt was hedged on average across FY24  Property portfolio continues to demonstrate resilience, maintaining high occupancy across the Dexus office portfolio of 94.8% and Dexus industrial portfolio of 96.8%, with rent collections remaining strong at 99.5%  Dexus Real Estate Partnership 2 (DREP2), which launched in October 2023, raised more than $300\u00a0million in equity commitments in its first close, with further equity commitments expected in FY25  Dexus Wholesale Property Fund (DWPF) outperformed its benchmark across all time periods. Since transitioning to Dexus?s platform, Dexus Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (DWSF) continued to generate strong performance and significantly outperformed its benchmark in FY24  Secured circa $4.9 billion of real asset transactions across the platform, including $1.7 billion of exchanged or settled Dexus divestments (circa $0.7 billion of which exchanged since FY23), maintaining balance sheet strength and further enhancing portfolio quality  Customer net promoter score strengthened further to +44, reflecting our focus on customer experience and a targeted program of activations Outlook Ross Du Vernet said: ?We have refreshed our capital allocation framework and shifted to a sector aligned operating model to drive performance in the next phase of the investment cycle. We have also refined our strategy and identified a set of clear action items to support our medium-term priorities of transitioning the balance sheet, maximising the contribution from the funds business and unlocking our deep sector expertise. ?Consistent with our strategy, from FY25 the distribution policy has been updated to pay out 80-100% of AFFO, providing a sustainable source of capital to invest through the cycle into return-enhancing investment opportunities. With a preference to co-invest alongside capital partners, we see attractive opportunities in the industrial, infrastructure and alternative investment sectors. ?Barring unforeseen circumstances, for the 12 months ending 30 June 2025 Dexus expects AFFO of  circa\u00a044.5-45.5 cents per security and distributions of circa 37.0 cents per security. ?Markets move in cycles and while conditions are presently challenging, we invest for the long term. The assets we own, manage and develop, the capabilities we build, and the relationships we forge with clients and customers continue to position us well to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns for Dexus Security holders and our capital partners over the long term. ?We have successfully divested $7.4 billion of Dexus assets over the past five years, enhancing the quality of the portfolio, which is now heavily weighted to prime grade office assets in core CBD markets as well as core industrial assets.\u00a0 ?A further circa $2 billion of Dexus assets are earmarked for divestment over the next three years which, together with the completion of committed developments, will further enhance the quality of our portfolio while maintaining a prudent level of gearing.? Financial result Operationally, AFFO of $516.3 million was 7.0% below the prior year. AFFO excluding trading profits of $506.0\u00a0million was 0.2% above the prior year, demonstrating resilience largely as a result of portfolio like-for-like income growth, an increased management operations contribution driven by the AMP Capital platform acquisition and performance fees, offset by near-term headwinds to funds under management, together with a higher average cost of debt. Rent collections for the Dexus office and industrial portfolio remained strong at 99.5%. Dexus?s statutory net loss after tax was $1,583.8 million, compared to a statutory net loss after tax of $752.7\u00a0million in FY23. This movement was primarily driven by $1,901.6 million of fair valuation losses on investment property as a result of capitalisation rates softening across the portfolio, compared to $1,183.9\u00a0million of fair valuation losses recognised in the prior year. The portfolio valuations resulted in a total circa 12.9% decrease on prior book values for the 12 months to 30\u00a0June 2024. These revaluation losses primarily drove the $1.91 or 17.6% decrease in net tangible asset (NTA) backing per security during the year to $8.97 at 30 June 2024. Dexus achieved a Return on Contributed Equity (ROCE) for FY24 of 4.0% largely due to valuation losses on 123\u00a0Albert Street and 25 Martin Place, partly offset by net valuation gains on industrial developments. Dexus maintained a strong balance sheet with pro forma gearing (look-through)2 of 32.0%, toward the lower end of the 30-40% target range, and $2.5 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities. Dexus has a weighted average debt maturity of 4.8 years, manageable near-term debt expiries and remains within all of its debt covenant limits, retaining its credit ratings of A-/A3 from S&amp;P and Moody?s respectively. On average, 92% of Dexus?s debt was hedged throughout FY24, providing material interest rate protection. Funds management platform continues to deliver for investors Dexus manages $39.7 billion of funds across its diversified funds management business. This year we achieved Final Completion and integration of the AMP Capital real estate and infrastructure platform and people. The acquisition has further expanded and diversified our funds management business. Dexus Real Estate Partnership 2 (DREP2), which launched in October 2023, has raised more than $300\u00a0million in equity commitments in its first close from both institutional and private investors, as well as returning DREP1 investors. This fund is expected to be materially larger than DREP1 at $475 million of equity, circa 90% of which has been committed across the real estate subsectors including credit opportunities. The funds platform continues to deliver performance for investors. Of the funds with a benchmark, 84% by funds under management outperformed their respective benchmarks in FY24. Dexus Wholesale Property Fund (DWPF) outperformed its benchmark across all time periods, and in FY24 outperformed by circa 200 basis points. Since transitioning to Dexus?s platform, Dexus Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (DWSF) continued to generate strong performance, outperforming its benchmark by over 400 basis points in FY24. The platform again achieved independent recognition across the institutional and retail investor space. All\u00a0offshore real estate clients from the Peter Lee institutional investor survey consider Dexus to be either above average or excellent and circa\u00a090% of these investors would consider Dexus for the right opportunity. Dexus also ranked first on unlisted real estate relationship strength index for the third consecutive year by asset consultants. Dexus was recognised as a Finalist in the 2023 Zenith Investment Partners Fund Award in the Real Asset category. All retail investor pooled funds are ?recommended? by Lonsec Research and/or Zenith, with Dexus Core Infrastructure Fund (DCIF) upgraded in FY24. Dexus secured circa $3.2 billion of transactions across the funds platform during the year, the vast majority of which were divestments on behalf of a number of funds to maintain strong gearing levels and facilitate redemption requests to meet client needs, an important part of its proposition as a leading fund manager. High quality property portfolio remains resilient Dexus?s $14.8 billion high quality portfolio comprises mainly $9.8 billion in office and $3.6 billion in industrial.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Office</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Industrial</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Key metrics</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30 Jun 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30 June 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30 Jun 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">30 June 2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Occupancy by income</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">94.8%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">95.9%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">96.8%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">99.4%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted average lease expiry (by income)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.7 years</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.8 years</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.3 years</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">4.8 years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stabilised leasing (sqm)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">160,400</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">197,000</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">170,500</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">272,100</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of stabilised lease transactions9</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">271</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">306</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">40</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">71</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Development leasing (sqm)9</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8,700</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">24,700</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">82,100</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">68,610</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of development lease transactions9</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">14</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">10</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Average incentives</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">27.9%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30.0%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">16.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">10.7%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Effective like-for-like income growth</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.6%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3.9%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2.4%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted average cap rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.05%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.21%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.45%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">4.76%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">In office, location remains a key differentiator for asset performance, with the Sydney core and Melbourne eastern core again reporting materially lower vacancy compared with their respective CBD averages. The Brisbane market continues to improve, benefiting from strong demand and limited medium-term supply. Despite persistent headwinds, Dexus?s office portfolio occupancy reduced only marginally during the year to 94.8% and remains well above the wider market at 86.4%. Average incentives of 27.9% again outperformed the market, reflecting the quality and location of our portfolio. Incentives were lower than FY23, which was impacted by some large renewal deals in higher incentive markets. Incentives in Sydney and Melbourne CBDs are expected to remain elevated in the near term before vacancy normalises. As\u00a0expected, effective like-for-like income growth11 slowed to 0.5%, reflecting amortisation impacts and downtime on select vacancies. On a face basis, excluding amortisation, like-for-like growth was 2.5%. The resilience of the office portfolio is underpinned by its high quality and heavy weighting to core CBD markets, where customers want to be. In Dexus?s experience, smaller tenancies generate on average higher returns and present less volatility and leasing exposure than larger tenancies. Dexus?s scale enables it to invest in systems and processes to service its customers efficiently. As a result, Dexus?s customer base is more diverse, with an average tenancy size of circa 1,200 square metres, and we have less exposure to large customers than our peers. We have proactively diversified our customer base over many years, and we continue to manage forward lease expiries within acceptable threshold levels. The industrial portfolio continues to perform well, albeit with some moderation as expected following the very strong run experienced by industrial markets over the past three years. Effective like-for-like growth11 softened slightly to 3.9%, impacted by a slight reduction in portfolio occupancy as a result of vacancies at select facilities. Average incentives increased to 16.5%, with incentives lower in the second half at 13.7%. Net effective releasing spreads remain strong at circa 17%. The portfolio is 15.4% under-rented, benefiting from continued market rent growth in Dexus?s key markets, and circa 26% of the portfolio is set to access rental reversion upon expiry by FY26. Dexus?s national and customer centric industrial portfolio consists of well-located, high-quality assets, and along with its development capabilities, provides a complete solution for customers with growth aspirations and net zero ambitions. Dexus?s strategic focus is on building long-term relationships with high value and growing customers. Circa 75% of industrial income is derived from relationships held directly with customers rather than third party logistics operators.\u00a0 Sustainability Dexus further progressed the priority areas of its sustainability strategy: Customer Prosperity ? Enhanced occupier wellbeing by lifting NABERS Indoor Environment rating to 5.2\u00a0stars and facilitating mental health training on behalf of Dexus?s customers; expanded the GreenPower Buyers Group program, avoiding over 2,200 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions since inception.\u00a0  Climate Action ? Progressed detailed decarbonisation roadmaps with commercially viable solutions across assets to support long-term performance and expanded the climate resilience program to an additional 52\u00a0assets. Dexus is well progressed in preparation for climate-related financial disclosure requirements commencing in FY26.  Enhancing Communities ? Partnered with Foodbank and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance in community campaigns and delivered meaningful connections through community activations across 120 assets in Australia and New Zealand. Dexus?s focus on its customers has seen it achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +44, at the high end of the NPS range of -100 to +100, and demonstrating an improvement compared to +40 the prior year. Dexus was again recognised as a leader across a range of global sustainability benchmarks, achieving the third highest score of global REIT peers in the S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) and being included in the S&amp;P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2024. The platform was also recognised for its leadership by Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), with DXS and five funds achieving 5\u00a0star GRESB ratings for 2023. Dexus, Dexus Office Trust, Dexus Office Partnership and DWPF ranked in the top 5% of participants globally. Dexus Healthcare Property Fund (DHPF), DWPF and Powerco in New Zealand were also recognised with regional sector leadership by GRESB. In addition, Melbourne Airport (an\u00a0infrastructure investment) was awarded a 2023 ?Airports Going Green Award?. Dexus also launched the second Reconciliation Action Plan (Reflect), endorsed by Reconciliation Australia, articulating its vision to create a lasting positive impact and a sustainable tomorrow for all Australians. Developments The Platform real estate development pipeline now stands at a cost of $16.1 billion, of which $7.9 billion sits within the Dexus portfolio and $8.2 billion within third party funds. Dexus completed the office development at 123 Albert Street in Brisbane and the retail redevelopment at 25\u00a0Martin Place in Sydney. At the flagship industrial development precincts of Horizon 3023, Ravenhall and ASCEND at Jandakot Airport, Dexus completed 158,300 square metres of development and progressed construction across a further 85,300 square metres. Dexus has circa $675 million committed spend on its pipeline until the end of FY25, including Atlassian Central in Sydney and Waterfront Brisbane Stage 1 for which the construction program is on track. Transactions and trading Despite a challenging transactions market, Dexus undertook circa $4.9 billion4 of transactions across the platform, comprising $4.6 billion of divestments and $0.3 billion of acquisitions. Since the FY23 result, Dexus has secured circa $0.7 billion of balance sheet divestments including the sale of One Margaret Street, Sydney, 5 Martin Place, Sydney and 130 George Street, Parramatta. Dexus delivered on its FY24 trading profit guidance and is restocking the trading pipeline with potential contributions from FY25.

The plan was announced a day after the European Environment Agency warned that EU member states are not doing enough to deal with the risks.  Brussels/Strasbourg (dpa/enr) - On Tuesday, the European Commission published its plan for managing risks exacerbated by climate change, such as floods and wildfires.   The strategy aims to strengthen the European Union's ability to adapt to the consequences of climate change, such as \"droughts, floods, forest fires, diseases, crop failures or heatwaves,\" a commission press release said.  Rather than mitigating climate change, the plan \"is about the far-less talked about part of climate action, which is adaptation,\" said EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra. \"What we are talking about here is building climate-resilient societies and economies,\" he said at a press conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday.   Hoekstra pointed to recent disasters in the EU - wildfires in Greece, flooding in Slovenia and a storm in Scandinavia - to underline the urgency.   Brussels is asking EU member states to coordinate better, improve understanding of the risks and adapt infrastructure planning.  The commission's plan came the day after the first ever climate risk assessment by the European Environment Agency (EEA), published on Monday, which said the EU is inadequately prepared. The report warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences if Europe failed to take urgent action to adapt to the risks posed by climate change.  The EEA assessment called on EU member states to work together at a regional and local level to tackle climate change risks with precautionary measures. According to the EEA report, \"Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world.\"  THE SOUTH IS ON FIRE  The dangers include fires, water shortages and their effects on agricultural production, while low-lying coastal regions face threats of flooding, erosion and saltwater intrusion.  The south is most at risk, the EEA report said. \"Southern Europe is particularly exposed to the risk of forest fires and the impacts of heat and water scarcity on agricultural production, outdoor work and human health,\" it added.  The report, which identifies 36 climate risks in the EU, states that \"heat-related risks have already reached critical levels in southern Europe,\" given the \"more frequent and more intense\" high temperatures in this region. This includes countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece.   The high temperatures have already led to dangerous forest fires in Portugal. One of the most lethal was in Pedr\\xF3gao Grande in central Portugal in June 2017. The fire caused 64 deaths and displaced around 200 people.  The EEA risk assessment said that while some regions face increased flooding, \"southern Europe can expect considerable declines in overall rainfall and more severe droughts.\"  There are also threats to food supply, ranging \"from agricultural production notably in Southern Europe, fisheries and aquaculture, to food processing and international supply chains.\" The report found that increased drought and rising heat not only endanger crop production in southern Europe but place central European countries at risk too.  However, the assessment does not mean that northern Europe is spared, as floods in Germany and forest fires in Sweden, for example, have shown in recent years.  'RISK OF CONFLICTS' OVER WATER  The European Commission's plan, presented on Tuesday, dedicated a section to water, \"a vital resource that is already under pressure in many parts of Europe due to structural mismanagement, unsustainable land use, hydro-morphological changes and pollution.\"  The commission warned that there is a risk of \"increased competition over water resources across sectors and uses, including potential risk of conflicts within and among the member states over transboundary water resources.\"  In Bulgaria, for example, water resources are expected to decline. This could exacerbate the risk of water scarcity in vulnerable areas, said Associate Professor Emil Gachev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In bad years, less vulnerable areas could be affected too, said Gachev, who works in the academy's Climate Atmosphere and Water Research Institute.   He was speaking at a forum about Bulgaria's water resources, held in Sofia on Tuesday. The forum was organized by the Bulgarian climate science media platform Climateka on the occasion of World Water Day, which takes place on March 22.  According to Gachev, one-third of the world's population is experiencing water scarcity. Water resources remain scarce and this problem will worsen due to the growing population, he said. He explained that the water resources are decreasing due to poor water management and pollution.

EU'S GREEN DEAL STARTS TO WILT  As elections loom, the \"European Green Deal\" plan to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050 looks under threat from growing resistance to its costs.  Many of the Green Deal's laws have been adopted: an end to selling internal-combustion engine cars by 2035; a border carbon tax; rules against importing goods from deforested zones. But momentum stalled last year with legislation to reduce chemical pesticides and to restore wilderness ecosystems - opposed on the grounds they could undermine food production in the EU.

Ross Du Vernet, Dexus Group Chief Executive Officer &amp; Managing Director said: \"In a challenging environment we have maintained high occupancy across both our office and industrial portfolios, ensuring strong cashflows with AFFO of $516 million. $1.7 billion of balance sheet divestments enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet with gearing toward the low end of our target band despite the impact of valuation declines.\"  Key highlights    * AFFO [1] and distributions of $516.3 million or 48.0 cents per security,     in line with guidance and 7.0% below the previous corresponding period.     AFFO excluding trading profits demonstrated resilience, up 0.2%    * Statutory net loss after tax of $1,583.8 million, compared to a     statutory net loss after tax of $752.7 million in FY23, primarily driven     by greater unrealised fair valuation losses on investment property in     FY24 compared to FY23    * Pro forma gearing (look-through) [2] remains prudent at 32.0%, toward     the lower end of the 30-40% target range despite the impact of valuation     declines. 92% of debt was hedged on average across FY24    * Property portfolio continues to demonstrate resilience, maintaining high     occupancy [3] across the Dexus office portfolio of 94.8% and Dexus     industrial portfolio of 96.8%, with rent collections remaining strong at     99.5%    * Dexus Real Estate Partnership 2 (DREP2), which launched in October 2023,     raised more than $300 million in equity commitments in its first close,     with further equity commitments expected in FY25    * Dexus Wholesale Property Fund (DWPF) outperformed its benchmark across     all time periods. Since transitioning to Dexus's platform, Dexus     Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (DWSF) continued to generate strong     performance and significantly outperformed its benchmark in FY24    * Secured circa $4.9 billion of real asset transactions across the     platform [4], including $1.7 billion of exchanged or settled Dexus     divestments (circa $0.7 billion of which exchanged since FY23),     maintaining balance sheet strength and further enhancing portfolio     quality    * Customer net promoter score strengthened further to +44, reflecting our     focus on customer experience and a targeted program of activations  Outlook  Ross Du Vernet said: \"We have refreshed our capital allocation framework and shifted to a sector aligned operating model to drive performance in the next phase of the investment cycle. We have also refined our strategy and identified a set of clear action items to support our medium-term priorities of transitioning the balance sheet, maximising the contribution from the funds business and unlocking our deep sector expertise.  \"Consistent with our strategy, from FY25 the distribution policy has been updated to pay out 80-100% of AFFO, providing a sustainable source of capital to invest through the cycle into return-enhancing investment opportunities. With a preference to co-invest alongside capital partners, we see attractive opportunities in the industrial, infrastructure and alternative investment sectors.  \"Barring unforeseen circumstances, for the 12 months ending 30 June 2025 Dexus expects AFFO of circa 44.5-45.5 cents per security and distributions of circa 37.0 cents per security [5].  \"Markets move in cycles and while conditions are presently challenging, we invest for the long term. The assets we own, manage and develop, the capabilities we build, and the relationships we forge with clients and customers continue to position us well to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns for Dexus Security holders and our capital partners over the long term.  \"We have successfully divested $7.4 billion of Dexus assets over the past five years, enhancing the quality of the portfolio, which is now heavily weighted to prime grade office assets in core CBD markets as well as core industrial assets.  \"A further circa $2 billion of Dexus assets are earmarked for divestment over the next three years which, together with the completion of committed developments, will further enhance the quality of our portfolio while maintaining a prudent level of gearing.\"  Financial result  Operationally, AFFO of $516.3 million was 7.0% below the prior year. AFFO excluding trading profits of $506.0 million was 0.2% above the prior year, demonstrating resilience largely as a result of portfolio like-for-like income growth, an increased management operations contribution driven by the AMP Capital platform acquisition and performance fees, offset by near-term headwinds to funds under management, together with a higher average cost of debt.  Rent collections for the Dexus office and industrial portfolio remained strong at 99.5%.  Dexus's statutory net loss after tax was $1,583.8 million, compared to a statutory net loss after tax of $752.7 million in FY23. This movement was primarily driven by $1,901.6 million of fair valuation losses on investment property as a result of capitalisation rates softening across the portfolio, compared to $1,183.9 million of fair valuation losses recognised in the prior year.  The portfolio valuations resulted in a total circa 12.9% decrease on prior book values for the 12 months to 30 June 2024. These revaluation losses primarily drove the $1.91 or 17.6% decrease in net tangible asset (NTA) backing per security during the year to $8.97 at 30 June 2024.  Dexus achieved a Return on Contributed Equity (ROCE) [6] for FY24 of 4.0% largely due to valuation losses on 123 Albert Street and 25 Martin Place, partly offset by net valuation gains on industrial developments.  Dexus maintained a strong balance sheet with pro forma gearing (look-through)2 of 32.0%, toward the lower end of the 30-40% target range, and $2.5 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities. Dexus has a weighted average debt maturity of 4.8 years, manageable near-term debt expiries and remains within all of its debt covenant limits, retaining its credit ratings of A-/A3 from S&amp;P and Moody's respectively. On average, 92% of Dexus's debt was hedged throughout FY24, providing material interest rate protection.  Funds management platform continues to deliver for investors  Dexus manages $39.7 billion of funds across its diversified funds management business.  This year we achieved Final Completion and integration of the AMP Capital real estate and infrastructure platform and people. The acquisition has further expanded and diversified our funds management business.  Dexus Real Estate Partnership 2 (DREP2), which launched in October 2023, has raised more than $300 million in equity commitments in its first close from both institutional and private investors, as well as returning DREP1 investors. This fund is expected to be materially larger than DREP1 at $475 million of equity, circa 90% of which has been committed across the real estate subsectors including credit opportunities.  The funds platform continues to deliver performance for investors. Of the funds with a benchmark, 84% by funds under management outperformed their respective benchmarks in FY24 [7]. Dexus Wholesale Property Fund (DWPF) outperformed its benchmark across all time periods, and in FY24 outperformed by circa 200 basis points. Since transitioning to Dexus's platform, Dexus Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (DWSF) continued to generate strong performance, outperforming its benchmark by over 400 basis points in FY24.  The platform again achieved independent recognition across the institutional and retail investor space. All offshore real estate clients from the Peter Lee institutional investor survey consider Dexus to be either above average or excellent and circa 90% of these investors would consider Dexus for the right opportunity. Dexus also ranked first on unlisted real estate relationship strength index for the third consecutive year by asset consultants. Dexus was recognised as a Finalist in the 2023 Zenith Investment Partners Fund Award in the Real Asset category. All retail investor pooled funds are 'recommended' by Lonsec Research and/or Zenith, with Dexus Core Infrastructure Fund (DCIF) upgraded in FY24.  Dexus secured circa $3.2 billion of transactions across the funds platform during the year [8], the vast majority of which were divestments on behalf of a number of funds to maintain strong gearing levels and facilitate redemption requests to meet client needs, an important part of its proposition as a leading fund manager.  High quality property portfolio remains resilient  Dexus's $14.8 billion high quality portfolio comprises mainly $9.8 billion in office and $3.6 billion in industrial.

The Brisbane market continues to improve, benefiting from strong demand and limited medium-term supply.  Despite persistent headwinds, Dexus's office portfolio occupancy reduced only marginally during the year to 94.8% and remains well above the wider market at 86.4% [12]. Average incentives of 27.9% [13] again outperformed the market, reflecting the quality and location of our portfolio. Incentives were lower than FY23, which was impacted by some large renewal deals in higher incentive markets. Incentives in Sydney and Melbourne CBDs are expected to remain elevated in the near term before vacancy normalises. As expected, effective like-for-like income growth11 slowed to 0.5%, reflecting amortisation impacts and downtime on select vacancies. On a face basis, excluding amortisation, like-for-like growth was 2.5%.  The resilience of the office portfolio is underpinned by its high quality and heavy weighting to core CBD markets, where customers want to be. In Dexus's experience, smaller tenancies generate on average higher returns and present less volatility and leasing exposure than larger tenancies. Dexus's scale enables it to invest in systems and processes to service its customers efficiently.  As a result, Dexus's customer base is more diverse, with an average tenancy size of circa 1,200 square metres, and we have less exposure to large customers than our peers. We have proactively diversified our customer base over many years, and we continue to manage forward lease expiries within acceptable threshold levels.  The industrial portfolio continues to perform well, albeit with some moderation as expected following the very strong run experienced by industrial markets over the past three years. Effective like-for-like growth11 softened slightly to 3.9%, impacted by a slight reduction in portfolio occupancy as a result of vacancies at select facilities. Average incentives increased to 16.5%, with incentives lower in the second half at 13.7%. Net effective releasing spreads remain strong at circa 17%. The portfolio is 15.4% under-rented, benefiting from continued market rent growth in Dexus's key markets, and circa 26% of the portfolio is set to access rental reversion upon expiry by FY26.  Dexus's national and customer centric industrial portfolio consists of well-located, high-quality assets, and along with its development capabilities, provides a complete solution for customers with growth aspirations and net zero ambitions. Dexus's strategic focus is on building long-term relationships with high value and growing customers. Circa 75% of industrial income is derived from relationships held directly with customers rather than third party logistics operators.  Sustainability  Dexus further progressed the priority areas of its sustainability strategy:    1. Customer Prosperity - Enhanced occupier wellbeing by lifting NABERS     Indoor Environment rating to 5.2 stars and facilitating mental health     training on behalf of Dexus's customers; expanded the GreenPower Buyers     Group program, avoiding over 2,200 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions     since inception.    2. Climate Action - Progressed detailed decarbonisation roadmaps with     commercially viable solutions across assets to support long-term     performance and expanded the climate resilience program to an additional     52 assets. Dexus is well progressed in preparation for climate-related     financial disclosure requirements commencing in FY26.    3. Enhancing Communities - Partnered with Foodbank and the Cerebral Palsy     Alliance in community campaigns and delivered meaningful connections     through community activations across 120 assets in Australia and New     Zealand.  Dexus's focus on its customers has seen it achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +44, at the high end of the NPS range of -100 to +100, and demonstrating an improvement compared to +40 the prior year.  Dexus was again recognised as a leader across a range of global sustainability benchmarks, achieving the third highest score of global REIT peers in the S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) and being included in the S&amp;P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2024. The platform was also recognised for its leadership by Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), with DXS and five funds achieving 5 star GRESB ratings for 2023. Dexus, Dexus Office Trust, Dexus Office Partnership and DWPF ranked in the top 5% of participants globally. Dexus Healthcare Property Fund (DHPF), DWPF and Powerco in New Zealand were also recognised with regional sector leadership by GRESB. In addition, Melbourne Airport (an infrastructure investment) was awarded a 2023 'Airports Going Green Award'.  Dexus also launched the second Reconciliation Action Plan (Reflect), endorsed by Reconciliation Australia, articulating its vision to create a lasting positive impact and a sustainable tomorrow for all Australians.  Developments  The Platform real estate development pipeline now stands at a cost of $16.1 billion, of which $7.9 billion sits within the Dexus portfolio and $8.2 billion within third party funds.  Dexus completed the office development at 123 Albert Street in Brisbane and the retail redevelopment at 25 Martin Place in Sydney. At the flagship industrial development precincts of Horizon 3023, Ravenhall and ASCEND at Jandakot Airport, Dexus completed 158,300 square metres of development and progressed construction across a further 85,300 square metres.  Dexus has circa $675 million committed spend on its pipeline until the end of FY25, including Atlassian Central in Sydney and Waterfront Brisbane Stage 1 for which the construction program is on track.  Transactions and trading  Despite a challenging transactions market, Dexus undertook circa $4.9 billion4 of transactions across the platform, comprising $4.6 billion of divestments and $0.3 billion of acquisitions.  Since the FY23 result, Dexus has secured circa $0.7 billion of balance sheet divestments including the sale of One Margaret Street, Sydney, 5 Martin Place, Sydney and 130 George Street, Parramatta.  Dexus delivered on its FY24 trading profit guidance and is restocking the trading pipeline with potential contributions from FY25.

Overall, July 2023 was 0.43 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.24 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other July in NASA's record, and it was 2.1 F (1.18 C) warmer than the average July between 1951 and 1980, scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York said.   The primary focus of the GISS analysis are long-term temperature changes over many decades and centuries, and a fixed base period yields anomalies that are consistent over time.   \"Since day one, President Biden has treated the climate crisis as the existential threat of our time,\" said Ali Zaidi, White House National Climate Advisor. Against the backdrop of record high temperatures, wildfires, and floods, NASA's analysis puts into context the urgency of President Biden's unprecedented climate leadership. From securing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in history, to invoking the Defense Production Act to supercharge domestic clean energy manufacturing, to strengthening climate resilience in communities nationwide, President Biden is delivering on the most ambitious climate agenda in history.\"  \"NASA data confirms what billions around the world literally felt: temperatures in July 2023 made it the hottest month on record. In every corner of the country, Americans are right now experiencing firsthand the effects of the climate crisis, underscoring the urgency of President Biden's historic climate agenda,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"The science is clear. We must act now to protect our communities and planet; it's the only one we have.\"  Parts of South America, North Africa, North America, and the Antarctic Peninsula were especially hot, experiencing temperatures increases around 7.2 F (4 C) above average. Overall, extreme heat this summer put tens of millions of people under heat warnings and was linked to hundreds of heat-related illnesses and deaths.

This strong outcome was primarily achieved as a result of increased activities in infrastructure (piping business for energy and water management applications) and in the renovation segment. However, the new build segment, particularly in Europe, recorded some sharp declines due to significantly higher interest and inflation rates. North America, on the other hand, proved to be more resilient and made a solid contribution to earnings. In light of the challenging market environment at the start of the year, the company intervened very quickly in the entire cost management process, contributing to the strong results. The established self-help program, aimed to increase earnings and improve efficiencies, also contributed ?\u00a046\u00a0million to the results. At the same time, technology optimizations were implemented that have led to a reduction in the company's energy consumption and thus, in addition to cost savings, to a reduction in CO2 emissions. These solid results once more demonstrate the resilience of wienerberger's sustainable and diversified business model, which has the necessary strength to successfully hold its own in difficult market environments. ?In 2023 wienerberger once again outperformed its markets and successfully maintained its position generating an operating EBITDA of ?\u00a0811\u00a0million, which is in line with our expectations. In terms of resilience, we have focused on a balanced portfolio by expanding the renovation and infrastructure segments. Also, our proactive cost management, innovation, and broad diversification in ecological new build, energy-efficient renovation as well as water and energy management are paying dividends. By enabling affordable housing, continuously improving people's quality of life and proactively responding to the challenges of climate change and its effects, wienerberger is becoming part of the solution and even more sustainable and successful,? says Heimo Scheuch, CEO of Wienerberger AG. Performance of the Segments  Europe West: In 2023, external revenues amounted to ? 2.2 billion (2022: ? 2.5 billion) and operating EBITDA came to ? 378 million (2022: ? 426 million). The 2023 financial year was characterized by persistently high inflation and rising interest rates. Demand fell in the new build segment, especially in Germany, while France, Belgium and the Netherlands still recorded good demand in the first half of the year. In the infrastructure segment, there were inflation-related declines in public contracts in almost all countries. However, the increased share of the wastewater systems business and profitable growth in the renovation segment had a positive effect on the performance. With the acquisition of the Danish Str\u00f8jer Group in the second quarter and Komproment ApS in the first quarter, wienerberger further expanded its sustainable range of innovative fa\u00e7ade solutions and thus its market share in the Nordic countries. The acquisition of Wideco Sweden, which was also completed in the second quarter, expands energy and water management solutions in Scandinavia. All acquisitions made a favorable contribution to earnings in the second half of the year and will continue to do so into 2024. Europe East: In 2023, external revenues amounted to ? 838 million (2022: ? 945 million) and operating EBITDA came to ? 213 million (2022: ? 223 million). Eastern Europe saw signs of a decline in inflation and interest rates from the second half of the year onwards. The continued significant reduction in the real purchasing power of the public sector and private households had a negative impact on wienerberger's end markets, with new build being particularly affected. The markets in south-eastern Europe were an exception, as both sales and earnings increased. Demand in the infrastructure sector was stable overall, although it was evident that the realization of projects continues to be delayed due to limited budgetary resources in the public sector. North America:\u00a0 In 2023, external revenues amounted to ? 838 million (2022: ? 945 million) and operating EBITDA came to ? 213 million (2022: ? 223 million).  In a sluggish market environment, wienerberger successfully increased market share and the operating EBITDA margin from 23.6% in 2022 to 25.5% in 2023 through proactive cost and price management. The long-term demand for residential space remains high level. Due to high level of interest rates, demand in 2023 was nevertheless subdued, especially in new build. In the infrastructure segment, the company recorded a significant increase in demand in the second half of 2023. Sustainability as a strategic and operational focus for business development  Sustainability has always been an integral part of wienerberger's corporate strategy. Since the 2023 targets have been achieved, they have been renewed and upgraded for 2026. The new three-year wienerberger sustainability program extends the environmental and social topics, leveraging wienerberger's sustainability targets to organic growth, both within internal processes as well as assisting society with products supporting energy efficiency and climate resilience. It provides the right strategic and operational focus for sustainable business development complemented by the areas of revenue from products supporting net zero buildings, water and waste management as well as diversity and inclusion. By the end of 2026, wienerberger will see 75% of its revenue come from building products through the sale of products that support net zero buildings, such as integrated solutions for roofs, outer walls including fa\u00e7ades, heating, cooling, and solar power generation. Dividend and 2024 Outlook  Considering the strong results for 2023 and the company's attractive dividend policy, the Managing Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of ?\u00a00.90 per share be distributed for 2023. By acquiring Terreal, a successful European provider of innovative roof and solar solutions, wienerberger will significantly expand its presence in the growing renovation segment and become the leading European expert for pitched roofs. In total, the transaction includes almost 3,000 employees, 28 production sites and expected annual sales of around ?\u00a0740\u00a0million. wienerberger is confident that the transaction will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. With the preparatory measures already taken in 2023, the company has done everything necessary to ensure the swift and efficient integration of Terreal immediately after closing. In order to ensure high profitability, wienerberger intends to significantly outperform its markets in 2024 again, building on its innovative and ecological solutions for renovation, infrastructure and new build. The company will also continue to focus on proactive cost management, price over cost and the continuation of the self-help program. Assuming that the market development of the fourth quarter of 2023 will continue in 2024, particularly in the first half of the year, and that the earnings contributions from the Terreal deal will make a positive contribution from the second quarter of 2024 onwards, operating EBITDA of around ?\u00a0860?890\u00a0million for 2024 is expected.

This strong outcome was primarily achieved as a result of increased activities in infrastructure (piping business for energy and water management applications) and in the renovation segment. However, the new build segment, particularly in Europe, recorded some sharp declines due to significantly higher interest and inflation rates. North America, on the other hand, proved to be more resilient and made a solid contribution to earnings.  In light of the challenging market environment at the start of the year, the company intervened very quickly in the entire cost management process, contributing to the strong results. The established self-help program, aimed to increase earnings and improve efficiencies, also contributed EUR 46 million to the results. At the same time, technology optimizations were implemented that have led to a reduction in the company's energy consumption and thus, in addition to cost savings, to a reduction in CO2 emissions. These solid results once more demonstrate the resilience of wienerberger's sustainable and diversified business model, which has the necessary strength to successfully hold its own in difficult market environments.  \"In 2023 wienerberger once again outperformed its markets and successfully maintained its position generating an operating EBITDA of EUR 811 million, which is in line with our expectations. In terms of resilience, we have focused on a balanced portfolio by expanding the renovation and infrastructure segments. Also, our proactive cost management, innovation, and broad diversification in ecological new build, energy-efficient renovation as well as water and energy management are paying dividends. By enabling affordable housing, continuously improving people's quality of life and proactively responding to the challenges of climate change and its effects, wienerberger is becoming part of the solution and even more sustainable and successful,\" says Heimo Scheuch, CEO of Wienerberger AG.  Performance of the Segments  Europe West: In 2023, external revenues amounted to EUR 2.2 billion (2022: EUR 2.5 billion) and operating EBITDA came to EUR 378 million (2022: EUR 426 million).  The 2023 financial year was characterized by persistently high inflation and rising interest rates. Demand fell in the new build segment, especially in Germany, while France, Belgium and the Netherlands still recorded good demand in the first half of the year. In the infrastructure segment, there were inflation-related declines in public contracts in almost all countries. However, the increased share of the wastewater systems business and profitable growth in the renovation segment had a positive effect on the performance. With the acquisition of the Danish Str\\xF8jer Group in the second quarter and Komproment ApS in the first quarter, wienerberger further expanded its sustainable range of innovative fa\\xE7ade solutions and thus its market share in the Nordic countries. The acquisition of Wideco Sweden, which was also completed in the second quarter, expands energy and water management solutions in Scandinavia. All acquisitions made a favorable contribution to earnings in the second half of the year and will continue to do so into 2024.  Europe East: In 2023, external revenues amounted to EUR 838 million (2022: EUR 945 million) and operating EBITDA came to EUR 213 million (2022: EUR 223 million).  Eastern Europe saw signs of a decline in inflation and interest rates from the second half of the year onwards. The continued significant reduction in the real purchasing power of the public sector and private households had a negative impact on wienerberger's end markets, with new build being particularly affected. The markets in south-eastern Europe were an exception, as both sales and earnings increased. Demand in the infrastructure sector was stable overall, although it was evident that the realization of projects continues to be delayed due to limited budgetary resources in the public sector.  North America: In 2023, external revenues amounted to EUR 838 million (2022: EUR 945 million) and operating EBITDA came to EUR 213 million (2022: EUR 223 million).  In a sluggish market environment, wienerberger successfully increased market share and the operating EBITDA margin from 23.6% in 2022 to 25.5% in 2023 through proactive cost and price management. The long-term demand for residential space remains high level. Due to high level of interest rates, demand in 2023 was nevertheless subdued, especially in new build. In the infrastructure segment, the company recorded a significant increase in demand in the second half of 2023.  Sustainability as a strategic and operational focus for business development  Sustainability has always been an integral part of wienerberger's corporate strategy. Since the 2023 targets have been achieved, they have been renewed and upgraded for 2026. The new three-year wienerberger sustainability program extends the environmental and social topics, leveraging wienerberger's sustainability targets to organic growth, both within internal processes as well as assisting society with products supporting energy efficiency and climate resilience. It provides the right strategic and operational focus for sustainable business development complemented by the areas of revenue from products supporting net zero buildings, water and waste management as well as diversity and inclusion. By the end of 2026, wienerberger will see 75% of its revenue come from building products through the sale of products that support net zero buildings, such as integrated solutions for roofs, outer walls including fa\\xE7ades, heating, cooling, and solar power generation.

They occur when individuals or groups want to use an area for different purposes, like agriculture, housing, industry, commerce, recreation or transportation. Tensions become particularly likely when people believe that their rights are being violated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Nigeria, land-use conflicts vary from one region to another, though there are common themes. In the north, Fulani herding communities frequently clash with farmers. The violence sometimes spreads into cities as well. In south-eastern Nigeria, oil companies and local people have a long history of clashes.</p><p>Nigeria's rapid population growth is compounding problems. According to UN data, Nigeria currently has over 200 million people, and the number is expected to double by 2050. The increase in people puts additional pressure on limited land in rural as well as urban areas.</p><p>The climate crisis is exacerbating resource-related conflicts further. Competition for water, arable land and pastures for herds is increasing at a time when traditional practices are becoming unviable.</p><p>Disputed ownership</p><p>Land ownership is crucially relevant, but often controversial. One reason is that traditional and especially collective ownership is often not properly recognised. Moreover, vacant plots may be considered to not belong to anyone. Encroachment, the unauthorised sale of community land and rental conditions can trigger conflicts in which local people are often pitted against outsiders. Whether a community-based group is simply acting in self-defence or has actually become an illegal gang is often not obvious, but a matter of perspective.</p><p>A typical kind of conflict is timber contractors versus farmers. Contractors often destroy farmlands when felling trees for commercial use.</p><p>Violent encounters between farming and herding communities are extremely worrisome. Disputes arise when herds destroy fields or even feed on farmers' crops. As the north is becoming more arid, nomadic herders look for pastures farther south, moving into areas where villages have been expanding their fields. Both sides feel that they are merely defending their livelihoods and insisting on what belongs to them.</p><p>Making matters more explosive, the herders are typically Fulani, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, while farmers are often Christians of other ethnic groups. Tensions over land use thus become entangled with faith-based identity politics. Given that Islamist terrorism is affecting some parts of Nigeria quite seriously, this is most dangerous.</p><p>Land-use problems also haunt the Niger Delta. Since independence, there have been various periods of violence and even full-blown civil war. Oil exploitation on community lands is problematic. International corporations have caused massive oil spills on land and in rivers, destroying livelihoods. Local people can no longer farm or fish, and their health has been impacted as well. Oil companies do not pay adequate compensations.</p><p>Government policies on land use and officers' abuse of power also cause disputes. The Land Use Act of 1978 is itself a bone of contention. It has been amended several times, but it does not take traditional notions of ownership and the right to access land into account properly. Government officers have a pattern of using legal ambiguities to demand bribes and using their powers arbitrarily. It can be quite difficult to tell at what point an official procedure turns into an illegal extortion scheme.</p><p>The rate of food insecurity in Nigeria is alarming. Last year, Cadre Harmonis\u00e9, a UN supported West African tool for assessing food security, forecasts that about 25 million Nigerians would be at risk of food insecurity this summer.</p><p>Land-use conflicts not only contribute to food insecurity, but also increase insecurity in general. In parts of north-western Nigeria, farmers are often forced to pay levies to armed bandits before they can go to their fields. Some pay with their crops, but many farmers cannot pay at all. As a result, food production is hampered. The problem is transferred to consumers when food prices increase. Poverty is therefore worsening in already marginalised areas.</p><p>When attacks escalate, some farmers flee and desert their lands. In extreme cases, entire communities are forced to relocate. Internal displacement is a huge issue in Nigeria, and the side effects include a loss of culture and identity.</p><p>Climate change is causing extreme weather in Nigeria, which also has an adverse effect on agriculture. During the 2022 rainy season, widespread flooding damaged 676,000 hectares of farmland. Twenty-seven of Nigeria's 36 states were affected. The flooding exacerbated food insecurity as well. Slow trends such as worsening aridity obviously affect agriculture too.</p><p>Land conflicts restrict the land available for agricultural production and environmental conservation efforts. They also obstruct development. In rural Nigeria, telecommunication companies have been prevented from laying their cables and denied access to their facilities until they make illegal payments to community leaders.</p><p>The way forward</p><p>Resolving land use conflicts will require peacebuilding measures, as well as a change in government policies. Experts have proposed a review of the Land Use Act of 1978 to make room for meaningful growth in agriculture and other sectors. To ensure food security and reduce land-use conflicts, the government must consider adopting policies that encourage sustainable agricultural practices, increase climate resilience and boost investment in renewable energy.</p><p>Courts play an important role in solving land disputes. However, legal processes take time and are expensive. Though they hurt the relationship between aggrieved parties, they are a legitimate source of conflict resolution. Some consider Kenya's Environmental and Land Courts (ELC), which are designed to reconcile formal and traditional understandings of justice, an example.</p><p>Another important step would be to encourage nomadic herders to switch to more sedentary livestock production. Measures could include teaching herdsmen local feed-preservation techniques, storing excess herbage using silage and hay and facilitating negotiations led by neutral parties. Nigeria has the natural resources to become one of the top agriculture-producing countries, but the first step is to give agriculture the attention it deserves and make good use of available arable land.</p><p>Reducing population growth and mitigating the climate crisis would help too. While Nigeria cannot rise to the latter challenge on its own, progress in fighting poverty would help to tackle the former one.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["The way forwardResolving land use conflicts will require peacebuilding measures, as well as a change in government policies.

At a series of events across COP28, Tony Elumelu delivered a single message to world leaders:\u00a0 Africa needs to be heard, Africa?s future is the world?s future and the continent that is most impacted by and the least contributor to climate change, needs our attention.\u00a0 With African youth set to make up one third of global population later this century, the future of Africa?s youth, entrepreneurial, ambitious, resilient, needs to be given the highest priority. Elumelu offered the infrastructure and experience of his own Foundation?s 10 year $100m entrepreneurship programme to partners, to catalyse a further generation of African entrepreneurs; entrepreneurs who can address climate change and drive the broader wealth creation that Africa requires.\u00a0 Reaching and funding young entrepreneurs in every African country, the Elumelu approach of sector agnostic seed funding, mentoring, and networking has delivered robust impact. The annual COP UN Climate Change Conferences unites the world to assess progress in combatting climate change.\u00a0 Elumelu is one of Africa?s leading advocates for an equitable agenda for climate action and through the Tony Elumelu Foundation has empowered thousands of green entrepreneurs, shaping a more sustainable future for Africa.

Elumelu represented the African private sector at the 2023 New Global Financing Pact in Paris at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, and the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum in London, at the invitation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom and U.S. President Biden.\u00a0 At the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) in New York, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) launched a first-of-its-kind Green Entrepreneurship Programme, the #BeGreenAfrica Initiative, in partnership with the IKEA Foundation, Dutch Government and UNICEF GenU, to support green entrepreneurship and youth development.

Speaking at the TEF #COP28 high-level event, Dr. Okonjo Iweala, DG, World Trade Organisation stated, ?I am proud of what my brother, Tony Elumelu, has done in empowering and inspiring so many young entrepreneurs.\u00a0 We have no choice; the future is green.\u00a0 The future of growth is two things ? it is green, and it must be inclusive. I am very interested in partnerships with organisations like TEF.? Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP added, ?The reason why UNDP associated itself with the Tony Elumelu Foundation years ago is because of the leadership and courage of the Foundation to trust and invest in young Africans.\u00a0 It was one of the first organisation to do so at that scale.? The Foundation partnered with the UNDP to empower thousands in the Sahel, with an ambitious project to impact the lives one million young Africans. Sergio Pimenta, VP, Africa at the IFC, also stated, ?Tony, I salute you and your Foundation for what you have been doing to support young entrepreneurs in Africa.

Before coming to the United States Treasury, I was working in venture capital, and I know first-hand that it is incredibly important what the Tony Elumelu Foundation is doing.

We are excited to begin partnership conversations.? Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy GMD, United Bank for Africa, announced, ?For us, UBA, we give market access into 20 geographies in Africa.\u00a0 Everything that we do is around Africa, and that is why we have partnered with the Afrexim Bank to launch the $6billion fund for SMEs with a focus on import substitution, working in four key areas including climate emission reduction.?

Women and marginalised groups bear the brunt, but get the least support. The climate crisis is causing losses and damages at an alarming rate. It is also compounding other destructive trends such as desertification and the erosion of ecosystems, leading to further and more intensified losses and damages.</p><p>The frontline communities are the first ones to face such impacts. So people are at the heart of climate crisis as well as climate resilience. The impacts of global heating affect women and men differently. Women's interests thus deserve explicit attention in decision making and implementation processes. In developing countries, women tend to depend particularly on natural resources. At the same time, they are too often neglected in public affairs and suffer most in times of crisis. Capacity building is needed to empower them to become more actively involved.</p><p>In several areas, adaptation success depends on taking a gender-inclusive approach:</p><p>Resources: Women and girls often face barriers to accessing resources, including land, finance and technology, and that limits their individual adaptation options.</p><p>Safety: Women and girls are often at a greater risk of violence, particularly in contexts of displacement and migration.</p><p>Health: Environmental change can exacerbate issues of female hygiene and health issues, in particular when safe water becomes scarce.</p><p>Economic opportunities: Climate change disrupts livelihoods, especially in rural areas where people depend on natural resources. Women and girls are affected in particular. More generally speaking, women's economic opportunities tend to be more limited than those of men - and that is particularly true in climate-vulnerable developing countries.</p><p>In spite of many difficulties, women are often agents of change in their communities. They play a crucial role in responding to the impacts of climate change and promoting sustainable development.</p><p>Consider the example of Tengarkhali, a village in southwest Bangladesh. It was often inundated with sea water, and increasing salinity reduced people's access to safe drinking water. For 20 years, Gita Roy and other women from her village in Bangladesh's Satkhira district, campaigned to convince villages and elders that reverse osmosis was the solution to their water scarcity problem. With the help of Water\u00adAid Bangladesh, the women of that village themselves now run the Moricchap Drinking Water Plant and have successfully tackled one of the lasting impacts of climate change.</p><p>To fully empower women, one must address cultural barriers and create an enabling environment. Core issues include:</p><p>Improving women's access to resources such as land, finance and technology, to boost their standing in their communities.</p><p>Investing in girls' education as well as capacity building and skills training for women, further empowering them to participate in public affairs.</p><p>Encouraging such participation, in particular regarding issues relating to environmental change and other gender-\u00adsensitive issues.</p><p>Mainstreaming gender-sensitive approaches in adaptation and mitigation measures.</p><p>Women's knowledge can play a critical role in responses to climate change. Their leadership is needed. National as well as international actors have a responsibility to empower women. Support is needed not only in financial terms. Education, capacity building and encouragement matter too.</p><p>Climate finance should be mobilised in a gender-sensitive manner and take into account all dimensions of gender justice. Without gender justice, there can be no climate justice.</p><p>Nusrat Naushin is a researcher at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) in Dhaka.

At a series of events across COP28, Tony Elumelu delivered a single message to world leaders: Africa needs to be heard, Africa's future is the world's future and the continent that is most impacted by and the least contributor to climate change, needs our attention. With African youth set to make up one third of global population later this century, the future of Africa's youth, entrepreneurial, ambitious, resilient, needs to be given the highest priority.  Elumelu offered the infrastructure and experience of his own Foundation's 10 year $100m entrepreneurship programme to partners, to catalyse a further generation of African entrepreneurs; entrepreneurs who can address climate change and drive the broader wealth creation that Africa requires. Reaching and funding young entrepreneurs in every African country, the Elumelu approach of sector agnostic seed funding, mentoring, and networking has delivered robust impact.  The annual COP UN Climate Change Conferences unites the world to assess progress in combatting climate change. Elumelu is one of Africa's leading advocates for an equitable agenda for climate action and through the Tony Elumelu Foundation has empowered thousands of green entrepreneurs, shaping a more sustainable future for Africa.  The Tony Elumelu Foundation, in partnership with the United Bank for Africa (UBA), hosted a high-level session, bringing together Africans, and key players in the Gulf, Europe, and Americas, where UBA operates, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation, while fostering sustainable development, and bringing attention to Africa's unique position.  Speakers included Dr. Okonjo Iweala, Director General, World Trade Organization; Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP, Kevin Frey, CEO, UNICEF Generation Unlimited; Sergio Pimenta, VP Africa, IFC; Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative, World Bank; Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate; Joseph Nganga, Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, Rockefeller Foundation; Hassan Al Hashemi, VP International Relations, Dubai Chambers; Serge Eku\\xE9, Chairman, West African Development Bank (BOAD); Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy Group Managing Director, United Bank for Africa; and Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of Delegation, UNFCCC.  \"Addressing climate change is the paramount challenge of our era. The urgency is unmistakable.\" Elumelu stated. \"It is critical that Africa, as a continent, and African voices, play a key role in global climate conversations, as meaningful participants, and no longer as bystanders. Africa is least responsible and is disproportionately impacted by climate change. I am investing in a generation of green entrepreneurs, and we are extending the hand of partnership, so that others can benefit and use the infrastructure and platform we have created to reach entrepreneurs across Africa.\"  Elumelu represented the African private sector at the 2023 New Global Financing Pact in Paris at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, and the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum in London, at the invitation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom and U.S. President Biden. At the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) in New York, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) launched a first-of-its-kind Green Entrepreneurship Programme, the #BeGreenAfrica Initiative, in partnership with the IKEA Foundation, Dutch Government and UNICEF GenU, to support green entrepreneurship and youth development.  Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur from Madagascar in the green economy, Marie-Christiana Kola, shared a compelling impact story. \"As a beneficiary of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship programme, I was able to create a recycled and 100% biodegradable hand soap made with waste cooked oil - the number one water polluter of water in African urban cities. These soaps do not only protect the environment, but they are also solidarity soaps. I was also able to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt, where I won the Innovation Prize. Today, I have employed over 30 people because of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\"  Speaking at the TEF #COP28 high-level event, Dr. Okonjo Iweala, DG, World Trade Organisation stated, \"I am proud of what my brother, Tony Elumelu, has done in empowering and inspiring so many young entrepreneurs. We have no choice; the future is green. The future of growth is two things - it is green, and it must be inclusive. I am very interested in partnerships with organisations like TEF.\"  Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP added, \"The reason why UNDP associated itself with the Tony Elumelu Foundation years ago is because of the leadership and courage of the Foundation to trust and invest in young Africans. It was one of the first organisation to do so at that scale.\"  The Foundation partnered with the UNDP to empower thousands in the Sahel, with an ambitious project to impact the lives one million young Africans.  Sergio Pimenta, VP, Africa at the IFC, also stated, \"Tony, I salute you and your Foundation for what you have been doing to support young entrepreneurs in Africa. The IFC has deployed $2billion in funding for African SMEs in the last fiscal year and we are very excited to be able to do more, working with you.\"  Kevin Frey, CEO UNICEF Generation Unlimited added, \"With TEF, we have moved in a concerted way into the entrepreneurial space. Generation Unlimited now have a flagship programme with the Tony Elumelu Foundation called #BeGreenAfrica, launched in Kenya, and now with the support of the IKEA Foundation and the Dutch Government, we have scaled to Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa, and Senegal. We will train and seed 500 green entrepreneurs this year in the pilot project across those countries. So Tony, thank you so much, you are right it is all about partnerships.\"  Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative at the World Bank, announced, \"Our women-focused initiative has been able to secure $3.6 billion to finance women entrepreneurs in 67 countries across the world, and is set to launch a new programme focused on financing African women entrepreneurs to drive the continent's green energy transition, and we are keen to work with the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\"  Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of UNFCCC Delegation stated, \"My Government and I commend the Tony Elumelu Foundation's incredible impact across Africa, and will facilitate connections between the Tony Elumelu Foundation, and the Swedish embassies across Africa to drive innovation, digitalisation, and green-energy transition, which promises to bring about new jobs and growth.\"  Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate, added\" Before coming to the United States Treasury, I was working in venture capital, and I know first-hand that it is incredibly important what the Tony Elumelu Foundation is doing. I have seen two pillars of their work - financing and the mentorship - just as I have seen with Silicon Valley, which helps to drive innovation and jobs creation. We are excited to begin partnership conversations.\"  Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy GMD, United Bank for Africa, announced, \"For us, UBA, we give market access into 20 geographies in Africa. Everything that we do is around Africa, and that is why we have partnered with the Afrexim Bank to launch the $6billion fund for SMEs with a focus on import substitution, working in four key areas including climate emission reduction.\"  Earlier in the day, Tony Elumelu joined Ajay Banga, President of World Bank Group; Brian Moynihan, Chair of the Board and CEO of Bank of America; Ms. Ruth Porat, President, Alphabet and Google; and Ms. Laurene Powell Jobs, Founder &amp; President of Emerson Collective as a panelist in a session titled \"Big, Audacious and Green: A Convergence of Visionaries\", moderated by B\\xF8rge Brende, President of World Economic Forum.

As Wienerberger, we are very proud to host this independent biennial award and are delighted by its popularity and high participation,\" says Heimo Scheuch, CEO of Wienerberger AG.  In total, there are five categories assigned to the Brick Award, varying slightly depending on the year and the development of trends and current topics. An independent, international jury selects the winners within the categories including one Grand Prize winner. The \"Feeling at home\" category accounted for the highest number of submissions at 28%, closely followed by the second most submitted category \"Living together\" with 27% and \"Sharing public spaces\" (25%). Further categories are \"Working together\" and \"Building outside the box\".  From all submissions a jury of internationally renowned architects, architecture critics, developers and journalists pre-selects the 50 most outstanding projects, which will be published in the Brick 24 book in October 2023. Evaluation criteria include an innovative design, architectural concept, sustainability aspects as well as clever and innovative use of bricks. The winning projects of the categories and the overall winner of the Award will be revealed in a grand ceremony in Vienna in spring 2024.

This represents more than 650 hospitals and thousands of other providers across the country, the White House said.  In a positive response to the Biden Administration's Health Sector Climate Pledge, these health sector leaders plan to strengthen resilience to climate change, protect public health, and lower costs.   The health care sector accounts for 8.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. So these commitments will help advance the Biden administration's goal to reduce emissions 50-52 percent in 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.  Two of the five largest U.S. private hospital and health systems - Ascension and CommonSpirit Health - and the largest US public health system have pledged to halve their carbon emissions by 2030.  Leading health sector suppliers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca have stepped up to achieve net-zero emissions ahead of the 2050 pledge timeline.  Major medical associations, including America's Essential Hospitals, the American Association of Medical Colleges, and the National Academy of Medicine, have committed to taking climate action.  The 61 organizations that have signed the pledge represent a large share of the US health sector.  Thursday, the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reopened the Health Care Sector Pledge until October 28.  Also, the Biden Administration announced a series of new resources to support the health sector in transitioning to clean energy, reducing emissions, and building climate resilience.

But a lack of expertise on the ground has also stalled crucial adaptation projects.From cyclones in the south, to floods and drought in the east: Climate change is already leaving its mark on the African continent. Although Africa accounts for the world's smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 just 3.8% \u2014 it's paying a severe price for a crisis it did little to help create. </p><p><br/>Many experts acknowledge that climate finance is crucial for Africa to be able to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change. Over a decade ago, wealthy nations pledged $100 billion (\u20ac91 billion) a year to developing nations by 2020 for this very purpose. <br/>Now \u2014 two years past the deadline \u2014 developed countries estimate they won't fulfill this pledge until 2023. And they're under increasing pressure to make good on their promise. <br/>\"We need to understand that Africa is warming faster than the entire globe,\" Richard Munang, the Africa climate change coordinator at the UN Environment Program (UNEP) told DW. <br/>\"The challenges of food insecurity and the socio-economic challenges that we are facing will only continue and put Africa in a very precarious situation. What is needed now is adaptation that drives resilience of communities.\" <br/>Needs continue to mount <br/>With Africa's share of the world's population expected to grow from 17% to 40% by 2100, the clock is ticking on climate adaptation projects. The continent is also struggling to maintain its momentum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 which were adopted by all UN member states in 2015 in a bid to end poverty and increase climate resilience by 2030 \u2014 as well as its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). <br/>\"Africa today needs $2 trillion to implement the NDCs,\" explains Munang. \"And on top of this, the continent needs $1.2 trillion to implement the SDGs. It is therefore imperative that support for Africa to [implement] climate resilience happens.\" <br/>Munang points to recent natural disasters as evidence that the global community needs to act on their pledge as soon as possible. <br/>\"You see mothers going hungry, crop failure, floods, drought and the displacement of people These realities are only going to increase under the changing climate. <br/>Project expertise missing <br/>But this narrative only partly explains Africa's dilemma. While some funds intended for climate change mitigation projects have made their way to the continent, it often unclear exactly how they are being used \u2014 or how they can be accessed in the first place. <br/>Adeline Tengem, a Cameroonian forestry technician and NGO leader, says she has tried to access climate financing several times without success. <br/>\"Our idea is to restore the degraded landscape while improving the livelihoods of local communities surrounding those landscapes,\" she told DW. \"So far, we have been struggling to access funding to carry out these kinds of projects. Each time I submit projects, they would reject it because [they said] it was of low quality.\" <br/>Tengem isn't alone in her struggle. Peter Gondo from the United Nations Forum on Forests says difficulty accessing climate financing is a recognized problem across the continent. He says it often comes down to a lack of expertise in formulating project proposals that meet the requirements of climate finance sources. <br/>\"[Applicants need] to demonstrate how the projects that they want funded contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation,\" he explains. \"This requires a lot of detailed, accurate data to estimate how much you are going to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if you implement the project. Many countries do not have enough experts with adequate skills to do that.\" <br/>Training for a better future <br/>To try and get more climate projects off the ground, the African Forest Forum has partnered with the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network (GFFFN). Together, they organize training sessions for forest stakeholders from the public sector and NGOs on \"climate finance and writing bankable projects.\" <br/>Tengem took part in a workshop in Douala, where she learned not only what kind of funding opportunities are available to her, but how to draft projects that meet funding requirements. She says she's now more confident in submitting her future proposals. <br/>\"I have learnt the mechanism that will take me from problem to solution, which is what the [financing] partners want.\" <br/>Ultimately, the initiative aims to help ensure that Africa will gain easier access to existing and future international climate finance. Sector stakeholders say with both adequate financing and expertise, Africa should on the path towards a low emission and climate resilient future. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection ? at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact ? are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent?s poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended. The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork ?for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.? Though summit attendees didn?t arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars: Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties, especially the most indebted countries.  Foster private sector development in low-income countries.  Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition in emerging and developing countries.  Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate change. The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It?s no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It?s not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it?s become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal. And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it ? and welcome it. It?s the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects. Valid Finance Concerns?Up to a Point To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation?s capital city. Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis. When Mottley ? an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas. Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank?s biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank?s then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass? leadership, the World Bank did too little to ?align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts? ? while it continues to fund oil and gas projects). Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world?s economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to ?mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.? And, again, that?s an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa?s gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa. To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that?s not what we?re seeing. Look at Afrieximbank?s Excellent Example In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa?s important domestic banks. For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to ?invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,? and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine ?our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.? As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies. Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that? At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in ?revitalizing Africa?s climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.? To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables. This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa?s economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What?s more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa?s much-needed industrialization, we all know that?s not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now. All of this requires money. As I?ve written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won?t work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN?s sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept. \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said. The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

It's not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it's become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal.  And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it - and welcome it.  It's the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects.  Valid Finance Concerns-Up to a Point  To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation's capital city.  Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis.  When Mottley - an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)- floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas.  Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank's biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank's then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass' leadership, the World Bank did too little to \"align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts\" - while it continues to fund oil and gas projects).  Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world's economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments.  The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to \"mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.\"  And, again, that's an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa's gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa.  To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that's not what we're seeing.  Look at Afrieximbank's Excellent Example  In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa's important domestic banks.  For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to \"invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,\" and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine \"our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.\"  As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies.  Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that?  At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in \"revitalizing Africa's climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.\"  To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables.  This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas  Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa's economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What's more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa's much-needed industrialization, we all know that's not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now.  All of this requires money.  As I've written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won't work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN's sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept.  \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said.  The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Experts say adapting farming practices and growing more millets can ensure India's food security.Russia's war on Ukraine disrupted wheat supplies and drove up food prices across the globe, as the two countries are the top two exporters. India, the third biggest exporter, stepped in to fill the gap in the global market. </p><p><br/>But India banned the export of wheat with immediate effect, just two days after announcing that it was eyeing a record push on wheat shipments this year. <br/>Days ago, India also announced it would restrict sugar exports to stabilize prices and ensure supply. India is the second largest exporter of sugar in the world.  <br/>Before the wheat export ban, India had set a goal of shipping a mammoth 10 million tons this year, looking to capitalize on the global disruptions to wheat supplies from the war and to find new markets for its wheat in Europe, Africa and Asia. <br/>Food security under threat <br/>Amid a severe heatwave and rising domestic prices, India's Directorate of Foreign Trade said the food security of India along with neighboring and vulnerable nations was under threat. <br/>India saw the hottest March since temperature records began, in 1901. Wheat grains usually ripen around this period, which is why they are extra sensitive to heat. <br/>With extreme weather conditions expected to become more and more common in the future, concerns are being raised about India's food security. <br/>India received requests to supply over 1.5 million tons of wheat from countries that are looking to prevail over the ongoing shortage of the commodity, with the bulk of the request coming from neighboring Bangladesh. <br/>\"India is keen to help vulnerable countries and anyone who needs wheat,\" an official told Reuters. <br/>Extreme weather changing growth patterns <br/>Namrata Ginoya, climate resilience expert at the World Resources Institute, says India's food security has become more vulnerable to extreme weather, unpredictable rainfall and other such climate factors. <br/>\"These events have a quick impact on food production, and since we are continuing on the high emissions trajectory right now, we will see a lot of impact,\" Ginoya told DW. <br/>Ginoya said there are several ways farmers can adapt to the changing weather conditions, and these practices are being followed on a smaller scale. <br/>\"We're seeing summers arrive earlier than the previous years. That is the time when the grains grow in the crop. If the temperature at the time is higher than 30-31 degrees Celsius [86-88 degrees Fahrenheit], it is bad for the growth of grains,\" Ginoya said. <br/>So, farmers can start sowing the grain 10-15 days earlier than usual. Changes can also be made in the irrigation and fertilization of crops, to adapt to the weather,\" she added.  <br/>She believes people need to move towards a style of farming in which every stage of production is monitored and researched, and farmers can access and utilize the findings of the research. <br/>\"We also need to identify areas where it is sustainable to grow wheat, and regions where it is no longer viable to grow the crop,\" she told DW. <br/>Millet as an alternative <br/>Even with changes in climate practices, wheat and rice may not be able to fulfill the domestic and international demands of the crop. <br/>Under these circumstances, some experts believe it is time to turn to millet, or nutri-cereals, to fulfill the food requirements of the world. <br/>\"I think we can expect more and more extreme climate events, and heat waves will exacerbate in the future,\" Ruth DeFries, professor of ecology and sustainable development at Columbia University told DW. <br/>\"We also know that coarse cereals, or what are now called as nutri cereals, such as jowar, bajra, raagi, have the physiology of being resilient. They have lower water demands and higher tolerance to coarse soils and heat,\" she added.  <br/>Due to their high levels of iron, fiber and certain vitamins, they are still grown in more than 130 countries. Yet they only play a significant role in the diets of some 90 million people in Africa and Asia, and are often regarded as food for the poor. <br/>By comparison, around half the global population relies on rice, and more than one-third on wheat. <br/>The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets, which could lead to changes in how these grains are perceived. <br/>However, substituting peoples' diets with the more commonly consumed rice and wheat could prove challenging. <br/>\"Historically, nutri-cereals were a part of the diets of many people in India, but that has declined over the last two decades. But now they are seen more commonly in grocery stores and restaurants, as they are a different kind of food and good for health too,\" said DeFries. <br/>Edited by: Leah Carter <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Prices for wheat, gas, and gasoline are at record highs. Crisis regions could see things getting worse than they already are.Every morning, the operators of a small kiosk located in an informal neighborhood in Kenya's capital Nairobi, bake fresh chapati \u2014 a popular flatbread. </p><p><br/>Chapatis usually cost around 20 Kshs ($0,17, \u20ac0,17). However, customers can hardly afford it anymore. \"Chapati costs twice as much now. Life has become extremely expensive,\" one customer at the kiosk complained. <br/>Samuel Mose, who heads the small bakery, told DW, that though prices for wheat flour and sunflower oil have been rising for some time, things are getting worse because of Russia's war on Ukraine. <br/>\"We are following the war because we need to know what is happening. Some of the products we use come from those two countries,\" Mose said. <br/>In Kenya, about one-third of imported wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. The price increase on the world market is also being felt by the Kenafric wholesale bakery in Nairobi, which produces bread for supermarkets. <br/>\"The situation is worrying, not only because of the price, but also because of availability,\" Kenafric's manager, Keval Shah, said. <br/>He regretted that many suppliers had already reduced their contracted quantities due to force majeure. <br/>The 2022 Kenya Economic Survey found that most Kenyans are increasingly turning to their savings and loans to meet the rising cost of living. <br/>According to Teresa Anderson, international climate policy coordinator at the nongovernmental organization Actionaid, many African economies are still reeling from the COVID pandemic, the climate crisis, humanitarian emergencies, or political and economic unrest. But she stresses that the effects of the Ukraine war have exacerbated the situation. <br/>Zimbabwe: Gasoline price triples <br/> \"Mothers are skipping meals, going hungry, many can no longer pay school fees, are working and dropping out of school,\" Anderson told DW, explaining that the global rise in prices is being felt more acutely in Africa than in other parts of the world. <br/>\"In Zimbabwe, the price of gasoline has more than tripled, as has the price of cooking gas. The price of noodles has more than doubled.\" <br/>According to Anderson, many countries are already in a supply crisis. \"But if nothing changes, we could be facing a famine of unimagined proportions,\" the climate resilience expert warned. <br/>\"The situation is particularly extreme in the Horn of Africa, where 20 million people are already suffering severe hunger because of the ongoing drought.\" <br/>Hunger in the Horn of Africa <br/>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) assessment is similarly worrying. In East Africa, prices have skyrocketed because of livestock deaths and crop yields far below the long-term average, Petroc Wilton, WFP spokesman in Somalia, said. <br/>Wilton added that the lack of wheat supplies from Ukraine had aggravated the food crisis. <br/>A humanitarian disaster is brewing in Somalia, according to WFP. Around 6 million people are affected by acute food insecurity, including 1.4 million children. If aid agencies do not receive additional funding, there could be a famine as early as the middle of this year. <br/>Hirsiyow Idolo Mohamed has already felt the full force of the crisis. The Somali woman left her impoverished village with her three children and struggled for fifteen days on foot through the hot desert with little water and food. <br/>But two of her children did not survive the arduous walk to the newly built camp for displaced people near the town of Dollow in the Gedo region of southern Somalia. <br/>Farmers flee drought and bombings <br/>\"We walked and walked and my son was very thirsty and exhausted. He asked me many times 'mommy, water, mommy water.' He started gasping, but there was not a drop of water I could give him,\" Idolo Mohamed told DW. <br/>The eight-year-old died upon arrival at the camp. He had been weakened from the journey and suffered from a severe cough. <br/>According to WFP, more than 500,000 people left their homes this year alone because of the drought. <br/>In West Africa, the security situation is also hampering food supplies. For example, farmers could not cultivate their fields due to attacks by the terrorist organization Boko Haram. <br/>Alarm bells ringing <br/>For Assalama Dawalack Sidi, regional director of the international charity organization Oxfam in Niger, action is urgently needed to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. <br/>\"This is an alarm signal for the world,\" Sidi said. \"We are witnessing 27 million people in West Africa being affected by the worst food crisis in the past decade,\" he stressed, adding that the number could rise to 38 million people if nothing was done. <br/>Yet wheat wouldn't have to be in short supply as there are significant reserves. <br/>In China, for example, experts estimate that the East Asian country has around half of the world's wheat stocks in its warehouses. However, they fear that the People's Republic could exploit the global food crisis by using grain to get concessions. <br/>\"China has enough reserves to support poorer countries in Africa with food supplies,\" Hendrik Mahlkow of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy told DW. The Communist Party could thereby increase its economic influence in Africa. <br/>Marion Betjen, Mariel M\u00fcller (Somalia), and Flourish Chukwurah (Nigeria) contributed to this article. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Bangladesh has made remarkable progress towards becoming climate resilient. More will be needed since global heating is getting worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Due to its geographic location and high population density, the entire country is a climate hotspot. Common issues include heat waves, erratic rainfall, flooding, droughts, cyclones, river bank erosion and ground water becoming saline due to the rising sea level. People who live close to river banks or the Indian Ocean Coast are especially at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The nation must cope with both slow- and rapid-onset crises. Climate change is affecting water availability, food security, nutrition, health and livelihoods in general. Loss of land or a failed harvest often push people below the poverty line. The results are displacement and social crisis.</p><p>Impressive progress</p><p>The good news is that impressive progress is being made. The death count of major cyclones has gone down spectacularly. In 2020, Amphan claimed 26 lives. In 1991, Gorky was of similar magnitude, but killed almost 140,000 people. Another two decades earlier, the death toll of Bhola was even worse: more than 500,000 dead.</p><p>These numbers show that the action taken by both government agencies and civil-society organisations has been successful. Today, Bangladesh has an effective early-warning system. Among other things, it relies on cell-broadcasting. Before an imminent catastrophe, text messages are sent to every mobile phone in the area concerned. Volunteers have been trained to manage evacuation efforts, with an eye to supporting needy people in particular. The coastal areas have an extensive network of cyclone shelters, and many of them serve other purposes too. Some, for example, are primary schools in ordinary times, for instance.</p><p>Preparing for disasters obviously includes teaching school children what to do when a cyclone strikes. It has become part of the national curriculum. When the need arises, the shelters can accommodate entire village populations. Indeed, most people flee there when disaster strikes, though some of those who do not, still perish.</p><p>Civil-society organisations matter very much</p><p>The role of non-governmental organisations cannot be over-emphasised. Bangladesh has a vast network of them, and many are involved in raising awareness of climate change and its impacts, disseminating knowledge among local communities and building capacities to tackle socio-economic hazards.</p><p>In this brief essay, the example of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society must suffice. After the deadly devastation of Bhola in 1970 and the war of independence in 1971, it established its Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) in 1972. Today, it has 70,000 volunteers who, in a unique institutional arrangement, serve communities at the grassroots level.</p><p>Cyclones, of course, do not only harm human bodies. They cause economic devastation which is harder to limit. Homes are destroyed, livestock killed and fields made useless. It adds to the problems that many families who depend on small farms or fishing are too poor to afford private insurance. The assets they lose - a boat, a cow or artisanal tools, for instance - may not be worth a lot of money, but to the people concerned, they are most precious. Their livelihoods depend on them.</p><p>For people to bounce back after a disaster, several things are helpful, they include reliable social safety nets and infrastructure that is strong enough to survive extreme weather. Economic opportunities matter too. In all areas, nature-based solutions are best because they are not only comparatively inexpensive, but also enhance, rather than deplete the resilience of the local eco-system. The rehabilitation of mangrove forest along the coast, moreover, has reduced the impact a cyclone has after landfall, with the trees serving as a first barrier. Moreover, locally-led interventions are to be preferred, because they tend to be both efficient and effective (regarding nature-based and locally-led solutions, also see David Mfitumukiza on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>In recent decades, Bangladesh has adopted several policies, plans and strategies for coping with climate change. Important ones include:</p><p>the National Adaptation Programme of Action of 2005 (NAPA), which was updated in 2009,</p><p>the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) of 2009,</p><p>the Standing Orders on Disasters (SOD) of 2010, which were updated in 2019,</p><p>the Climate Change and Gender Action Plan (ccGAP) of 2013,</p><p>the National Disaster Management Policy of 2015,</p><p>the National Disaster Management Plan for the years 2021 to 2025,</p><p>the Eighth Five Year Plan 2020-2025,</p><p>the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 of 2018,</p><p>the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) of 2021.</p><p>In the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, moreover, the Government of Bangladesh has prepared a national adaptation plan and spelled out the nationally determined contributions to multilateral climate action.</p><p>Comprehensive vision</p><p>The focus of policymaking has been expanded from initially identifying and tackling problems of an immediate nature to increasingly holistic approaches that boost the resilience of individual people, local communities and ultimately society as a whole. The vision is to eradicate poverty and achieve economic and social well-being. The Government of Bangladesh's idea of climate resilience is both pro-poor and gender-sensitive. It keeps updating its policies in the light of new evidence and insights.</p><p>So far, two national ministries play lead roles. They are the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. Other ministries, however, are expected to design their own programmes in accordance with the overarching policies. Subnational government institutions matter too, of course, including district administrations and municipal authorities. All ministries are expected to prepare their own detailed work plan in accordance with the SOD guidelines. Moreover, there are Disaster Management Committees (DMC) at all subnational levels.</p><p>In terms of implementation, Bangladesh has been relying on its own financial resources to a large extent. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) was established in 2010. The national government uses it to distribute funding. So far, the \u00adBCCTF has disbursed the equivalent of about $ 450 million.</p><p>Most of the related projects have focused on things like water infrastructure, food security and disaster risk reduction. Apart from multi-purpose shelters, other kinds of built infrastructure are helpful, including for example drainage and irrigation channels. River regulation and hydraulic systems matter too, and strong embankments protect people and fields from flooding. In a more general sense, agricultural adaptation, afforestation and reforestation help to reduce disasters risks too.</p><p>International funding</p><p>The country has also received financial resources from abroad in past decades. Official development assistance (ODA) and various forms of climate finance has helped Bangladesh to gradually turn vulnerability into resilience. It is disappointing, however, that high-income countries have not been living up to all climate-finance commitments (see Saleemul Huq on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Although Bangladesh has come a long way in achieving resilience, there is still room for improvement. According to the most recent assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>), one of the problems Bangladesh will most likely face is even more frequent and more intense cyclones in the future.</p><p>The IPCC has also mentioned maladaptation to environmental change as a serious challenge. In Bangladesh, shrimp cultivation is an example. Converting agricultural land to aquaculture ponds brought short-term benefits, but the long-term impacts have proven to outweigh them. The business is now seen to be unsustainable. Future development plans must be better geared to eco-friendly, but broad based prosperity.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Comprehensive visionThe focus of policymaking has been expanded from initially identifying and tackling problems of an immediate nature to increasingly holistic approaches that boost the resilience of individual people, local communities and ultimately society as a whole.

Summit, taking place Dec. 13-15 in Washington, D.C., will show America?s earnest and enduring commitment to Africa in the broad sense. The African Continent, some organizers have said, will shape the future of the world.\u00a0 We truly believe that the leaders who will assemble in Washington have the best intentions in mind. They will be determined to effect positive change on everything from African governance and human rights to food security and education. The heads of state and business and government leaders who will meet during the Summit?s U.S.-African Business Forum will try in good faith to advance mutually beneficial two-way trade and investment partnerships. As history has demonstrated, however, promises made at such lofty meetings, no matter how heartfelt, are frequently not kept. History tells us that time and time again, the high ideals, good words, handshake commitments (and even contractual obligations) which are reached at these meetings have, for any range of intervening reasons, been ignored, set aside, overlooked, or found to be too ambitious to complete. (Consider, for example, the West committing to giving $100 billion a year by 2020 to help emerging economies reduce emissions and prepare for climate change.\u00a0 When the original target was missed, it was moved ? and has yet to be met.) To the extent possible, dear Sirs, let?s avoid building such bridges to nowhere in this Summit. What to Do About Africa?s Energy Resources As you?d imagine given the authorship of this Open Letter, our true aim herein is to speak on the issue of Africa?s energy resources and the policies that will prevail in the Continent?s use of those resources. We are aware that, inevitably, the topic of African energy will arise, interwoven as it is with issues ranging from the effect of climate change to the potential for industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth. There?s no question that African energy is a hot-button topic, pitting climate activists who want the continent to keep its considerable hydrocarbon assets (including newly found natural gas reserves) in the ground, on the one hand, against others who recognize that fossil fuels cannot be discarded in Africa in the short run if the continent hopes realistically to lift people out of energy ? and real ? poverty. Under the banner of ?climate justice,? the many in the developed world have cut off public financing for new African fossil fuel projects ? although that hasn?t stopped them from bankrolling or even subsidizing their own hydrocarbon activities or seeking feverishly to secure increased hydrocarbon commodities for a European Union threatened by an unprovoked and unjust war. Wealthy nations contend that because Africa is more vulnerable than most to the severe effects of climate change, the continent must abandon its oil and gas opportunities, and the economic and social improvements that come with it, and switch to renewables ? NOW. In fact, Sirs, the true impact of future climate crises on everyday Africans is actually exacerbated by their current state of impoverishment. Without the minimal level of development and infrastructure, Africans face harsher consequences BECAUSE they don?t have the accoutrements of development?shelter, power, diet, and personal amenities?that people in the developed world will use on an individual basis to defend against any creeping climate degradation. That is, to give Africans an even chance to survive climate disasters of the future, let?s give them the resources to bring them up to the level of personal protections that others around the world have. Africa?s Hydrocarbon Resources Must be Considered In the Global Context, Not in a Vacuum First, as is widely known, to the degree that greenhouse gases cause climate change, the problem is not of Africa?s own making.  It is irrefutably known that Africa produces an infinitesimal amount of greenhouse gases and has the lowest emissions per capita of any region on earth. At an event during COP 27, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) reminded participants that Africa, where one-fifth of the world?s population lives, currently contributes only 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. How would monetizing Africa?s natural gas reserves change that figure? Not very much, especially in light of how it would benefit everyday Africans. According to Birol, were the continent to turn all of its natural gas discoveries into production it would add 90 billion cubic meters (bcm) of useful energy by 2030. Two-thirds of that could be used for domestic needs ? among other things, to provide power to the 600 million Africans who still lack access to electricity and to wean the 900 million Africans (mostly women) who rely on biomass for cooking off the hazardous stuff ? and the rest exported, and even then the amount of greenhouse gases coming out of Africa would rise only to 3.4%, ?which is nothing,? Birol said. Yet the world is trying to keep that solution out of our reach. Second, it is countries that prospered via fossil-fueled industrialization that wish to deny us the same privilege. Despite the fact that fossil fuels enabled the technological revolution and have led to massive improvements in quality of life and longevity across the globe ? all things Africa needs, deserves, and has the hydrocarbon means to achieve ? big economies want us to stop using oil and natural gas as soon as possible. But, as Miriam Hinostroza, an environmental economist with the UN Environment Programme, told UN News, that?s out of the question. Banning fossil fuels within the next decade, she said, ?is not a reality? ? at least not without economic and social fallout. ?Sometimes, a priority for countries is economic growth, which they only get from using fossil fuels ? they are still cheap, the technologies are there, there are many power plants [and] they cannot [all of a sudden] just get rid of these plants, Hinostroza said. Economist Vijaya Ramachandran goes even further. ?It is not fair for rich countries to fight climate change at the cost of low-income countries? development and climate resilience,? Ramachandran wrote for nature.com. Instead, she suggests the adoption of funding criteria that consider economic growth alongside climate impact, where countries with ?lower per-capita incomes, low emissions, or high use of green energy are deemed more eligible for development projects that depend on fossil fuels.? One example: using the 4.2 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of natural gas along the Tanzania?Mozambique border to expand access to electricity and generate much-needed revenue in two ?low-income, low-emitting countries.? Third, a fossil fuel-free world doesn?t reflect current market realities ? including how accustomed Europeans are to keeping their homes and businesses warm and well-lighted, especially during a dark and blustery winter. Yes, in a perfect world, the wind would always blow, the sun would always shine, and Russia would never have invaded Ukraine, meaning natural gas supplies would still move unfettered across Europe. But with none of this being the case, since June the EU has returned to using coal, the dirtiest energy source (although at least it banned imports of Russian coal). Somehow, EU officials believe they can take that step without ?derailing their longer-term climate goals.? And even though the European Parliament labeled investments in gas and nuclear power plants as climate-friendly, unrelenting pressure to keep African gas in the ground remains, and renewables advocates say there should be no new investment in infrastructure that would bring African gas to Europe. Fourth, despite arguments that investments into Africa?s fossil fuel sector are undermining the enormous potential of Africa?s renewables, growth is already underway. Most of the electricity in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, and Uganda comes from hydroelectric power, and several other countries have taken steps toward scaling up other renewables through policy-building, regional collaboration, and investment promotion. The problem, however, is that investment in the continent?s wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable power-generating projects was just $2.6 billion in 2021, an 11-year low.\u00a0 Of the $434 billion invested in renewables worldwide, Africa?s share was just 0.6%. Before Africa can more fully embark on a low-carbon future there must be global strategies for mobilizing capital into renewables, and the world must honor the billion-dollar promises it has already made. Let?s Avoid Being Ad Hoc About Africa?s Role in Climate Change Remediation As many of you know, delegates at COP27 agreed to create a fund that would compensate poorer nations harmed by climate change. Eligible countries are in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Reaction to the announcement has been far-ranging, from cheers to assertions that it is paternalistic (and perhaps even racist), to the earnest admissions of some scientists that it?s difficult at his stage to gauge climate change damage in such regional terms or tell if a specific weather event is even due to climate change. Then there were those who asked if, instead of receiving loss-and-damage dollars, African nations could be paid to keep hydrocarbons in the ground, thereby avoiding whatever greenhouse gases they would emit. Of course, any such ?reparations,? as they have been loosely (and, from a legal standpoint, inaccurately) called, depend on the UN actually raising the estimated $290 billion to $580 billion required ANNUALLY to keep the loss-and-damage fund going. And as we know, no matter how good the intentions, it?s not always easy to bring them to fruition.\u00a0 In specific regards to Africa?s energy resources, we encourage participants to promote a sustainable development of Africa, including universal energy access ? recognizing that it will require a variety of energy sources.\u00a0 Africa has too much oil and natural gas to ignore, especially when they can be used to raise people to the way of life most Americans have been enjoying for decades. Africa should not be the test case for a renewables-only future because the world finds itself in a panic over emissions. We have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to negative externalities. Ramachandran has said Africa needs reliable energy infrastructure, not rich-world hypocrisy. To paraphrase Benjamin Attia and Morgan Bazilian of the Colorado School of Mines, limiting the use of fossil fuels in Africa can make poverty and inequality worse while not accomplishing much in the way of reducing global greenhouse emissions, especially as fossil fuel use continues around the world. In the End, Dear Delegates, We Ask for This We at the Africa Energy Chamber are not writing this letter with animosity, nor are we neutral on the importance of d\u00e9tente between the US and Africa on the range of issues that are on the agenda of the Summit. Indeed, we are candidly grateful for the robust approach the new US Administration has taken on matters of US/Africa cooperation. We applaud the US leadership for its continuous engagement with us as well as various African Presidents. But any observer of the growing indecisiveness on the future of Africa?s use of its resources for its own betterment must agree that the Summit offers a chance to break energy transition stalemate and offer solutions to Africa?s dual obligations to support climate-smart policies while also striving to end the vast energy deficit and economic poverty on the Continent. We know that, for three days in Washington, D.C., everyone will work toward tangible, measurable results. What we hope is that, throughout the events, the Parties gravitate towards mutual accommodation and the overall betterment of conditions in Africa. Most of all, we are asking that everyone who attends the Summit only makes promises they can keep. The time for empty gestures is over. Today calls for action. The true test of how successful the Summit is will not be the news reports about it afterward but the results we see in the months and years to come.

The African Continent, some organizers have said, will shape the future of the world.  We truly believe that the leaders who will assemble in Washington have the best intentions in mind. They will be determined to effect positive change on everything from African governance and human rights to food security and education. The heads of state and business and government leaders who will meet during the Summit's U.S.-African Business Forum will try in good faith to advance mutually beneficial two-way trade and investment partnerships.  As history has demonstrated, however, promises made at such lofty meetings, no matter how heartfelt, are frequently not kept. History tells us that time and time again, the high ideals, good words, handshake commitments (and even contractual obligations) which are reached at these meetings have, for any range of intervening reasons, been ignored, set aside, overlooked, or found to be too ambitious to complete. (Consider, for example, the West committing to giving $100 billion a year by 2020 to help emerging economies reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. When the original target was missed, it was moved - and has yet to be met.)  To the extent possible, dear Sirs, let's avoid building such bridges to nowhere in this Summit.  What to Do About Africa's Energy Resources  As you'd imagine given the authorship of this Open Letter, our true aim herein is to speak on the issue of Africa's energy resources and the policies that will prevail in the Continent's use of those resources.  We are aware that, inevitably, the topic of African energy will arise, interwoven as it is with issues ranging from the effect of climate change to the potential for industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth.  There's no question that African energy is a hot-button topic, pitting climate activists who want the continent to keep its considerable hydrocarbon assets (including newly found natural gas reserves) in the ground, on the one hand, against others who recognize that fossil fuels cannot be discarded in Africa in the short run if the continent hopes realistically to lift people out of energy - and real - poverty.

Wealthy nations contend that because Africa is more vulnerable than most to the severe effects of climate change, the continent must abandon its oil and gas opportunities, and the economic and social improvements that come with it, and switch to renewables - NOW.

Politicians and experts met at an \"Africa Roundtable\" to discuss how to reset the relationship for the benefit of all.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier set the tone in his opening remarks for the \"The Africa Roundtable\" held on Wednesday when he called for greater cooperation between Europe and Africa. \"We, Africa and Europe, need each other to tackle the big challenges, and we can learn a lot from each other in the process,\" he said at the start of the online debate organized by the Global Perspectives Initiative (GPI). </p><p><br/>Steinmeier said that it was crucial to cooperate closely in fighting the pandemic, climate change, migration, digitization, terrorism, and globalization. He called for a more significant contribution by western countries to the global vaccination campaign against the coronavirus virus. All panelists agreed that one thing the pandemic had taught the world was, as Nigerian economist Oby Ezekwesili put it: \"Health is economy and economy is health.\" <br/>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala had already warned in February, when she took over as director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), that there would be no \"business as usual\" after the pandemic. At the online debate, she specified that she intended to dismantle existing trade barriers for basic medical products, vaccines, and active ingredients. <br/>Fair play for Africa <br/>Senegalese President Macky Sall agreed that it was important to vaccinate global populations to ensure an end to the pandemic for all and restart the global economy. But this alone will not solve Africa's problems. \"We must support the economic recovery through strong and innovative measures,\" Sall said. Such measures include greater flexibility vis--vis debt ceiling rules and the budget deficit threshold for developing countries. Other support could come via \"easier access to loans on terms compatible with the enormous investment required in heavy infrastructure and more transparent and fairer assessments of investment risk in Africa,\" Sall proposed. <br/>Many panelists concurred that the exaggerated perception of Africa as high-risk for business investments has significantly hampered needed investments on the continent. <br/>This is all the more urgent since African populations, while not as badly hit by Covid-19 as those in Europe and other parts of the world, will, as is often the case in international crises, bear the brunt of the pandemic's economic fallout, several panelists said. That also applies to the second big issue identified by the panelists: the danger of climate change to health and economies. <br/>Europe's responsibility <br/>Economist Ezekwesili admitted the importance of economic growth in Africa, notably in an equal partnership with rich countries. But for this to happen required \"the continent first taking responsibility for its development. There is no way that Germany or any other country can parachute development to Africa,\" she said. <br/>For a partnership to be equal, Europe needs to acknowledge its special responsibilities, for instance, regarding climate change, said Ska Keller, head of the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament. She stressed that \"the contribution of the African continent to that climate crisis has been marginal, especially compared to what the EU has historically been emitting as greenhouse gases.\" In her view, \"the EU needs to step up efforts a lot to do a fair share of the global effort to combat the climate crisis.\"  <br/>Keller also said it was important not to see the green transition everybody agrees must come as separate from a social transition.

Brutal heatwaves seen recently along the western seaboard of the United States and Canada, as well as in Siberia and other parts of the world, are further evidence of an increasingly hostile climate \u2014 and the need to adapt to it, fast. <br/>A global problem <br/>The pictures from Germany underscore the dangers that climate change poses even to the world's most advanced economies. While Europe has done more than most to attempt to mitigate the risks \u2014 the European Commission recently proposed the most ambitious package of climate measures yet by a major economy \u2014 these will not reverse changes that have already happened. Carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for about 100 years.  <br/>A certain amount of warming \u2014 and the extreme weather events associated with it \u2014 is already baked into our future making adaptation a necessity even if the Paris Agreement targets are met. Scientists warn that the recent floods and heatwaves are not the new normal, rather they herald the end of a stable climate. And without action, according to the World Bank, up to 132 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change by 2030. <br/>These warnings must urge us into faster action, with more funding, to adapt and\u202ffind ways to work with the natural world rather than against it. <br/>By accelerating investment today, we can prevent billions \u2014 even trillions \u2014worth of economic damage and save many thousands of lives. A Global Commission on Adaptation report found that investing $1.8 trillion (\u20ac1.5 trillion) globally by 2030 in just five key areas, including climate-resilient infrastructure, such as\u202fstronger dams and drainage systems, and early warning systems could generate $7.1 trillion in total net benefits.  <br/>Some excellent climate-resilience projects already exist. In Germany, the new district of HafenCity within Hamburg is being built on raised plinths, lifting the whole area at least eight meters above sea level. In the Netherlands, engineers have been working on \"Room for the River,\" a program to widen and deepen the rivers Rhine, Meuse, Waal and IJssel to protect nearby cities and towns. Besides creating additional water channels, flood-prone buildings have been removed and additional storage basins created with farmers co-operating to allow agricultural areas to be flooded as required. <br/>In China, where floods have caused on average 251 billion ($38 billion, \u20ac33 billion) of damage annually in the decade to 2016, so-called sponge cities such as Xiangyang Han River Eco City now feature more water-absorbent areas including green roofs, fewer hard surfaces, and more efficient water channels and storage. <br/><br/>Sharing success <br/>On their own, however, these projects are not enough. One of the greatest challenges of climate adaptation is that responsibility spans many diverse authorities, at the local, regional and national level. <br/>Extreme heat, floods and storms also require precautionary planning and upfront investment in adaptation measures. <br/>This makes it imperative that we share successful strategies and transfer knowledge and solutions wherever appropriate. To understand the scale of action needed, as well as measure success, governments and the private sector must carry out climate vulnerability assessments and stress tests to evaluate the risk of damage from flooding and heat stress. They must incorporate the resulting data into planning and investments, and closely monitor progress toward greater resilience. <br/>We need to act fast. Gathering detailed knowledge will also allow us to better protect vulnerable groups, which usually suffer disproportionately more. <br/>These recent extreme weather events have shown that the climate emergency is an all-of-society and all-of-world problem. It is encouraging to read that the US and the EU are planning to increase their contributions to help developing countries fight climate change, but all developed countries must now deliver on their promise to jointly mobilize $100 billion a year in finance for both mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.  <br/>As the floods in Europe and China have shown, we need to accelerate adaptation efforts worldwide to ensure we are as well placed as possible to deal with whatever our newly unstable climate unleashes next. And we need to do it now. <br/>Ban Ki-moon is 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations.\u202fPatrick Verkooijen is CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation in Rotterdam. <br/></p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 61, "title": "DGAP-News: ITOCO Inc.: ITOCO is pleased to present its Carbon Capture Offset program to the upcoming COP26 Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom.", "published": "2021-10-07", "bodyText": "<table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DGAP-News: ITOCO Inc.  / Key word(s): Miscellaneous ITOCO Inc.: ITOCO is pleased to present its Carbon Capture Offset program to the upcoming COP26 Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom. 07.10.2021 / 13:45 The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.ITOCO is pleased to present its Carbon Capture Offset program to the upcoming COP26 Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom. TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / October 7, 2021 / ITOCO INC. (OTC Pink:ITMC) ITOCO representatives will be presenting to and attending the meeting session COP 26, Glasgow, UK, from 25 Oct 2021 to 12 Nov 2021. COP26 is the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference. It is the largest Conference of its type in the world. The climate talks will be the largest international summit ever held in the UK, bringing together heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to agree on actions to tackle climate change. The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture Program in Mexico has demonstrated Nopal Cactus farming innovations that leverages the cacti's superb adaptation to dry and arid landscapes, which include fixing carbon dioxide at night and closing the spores (stomata) during the day, thus earning producers carbon credits at an accelerated pace in under twelve months. In other words, Nopal Cactus efficiently removes carbon from the atmosphere permanently. Nopal Cactus is able to trap up to 30 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year. The Cactus is also able to offer strong vegetative cover against erosion or desertification while being able to tolerate a wide range of temperatures and to thrive in water limited environments. As is characterized by a wide-spreading fibrous roots system allowing it to access surface water and its succulent stems and pads store large quantities of water per hectare. These can be obtained by factory processing and purified for domestic use as acknowledged by the United Nations Food Agriculture Organization. The impact on air pollution, soil remediation, and water provisioning would reach and improve many lives in the dry and arid areas we propose to set up the innovation. ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Carbon Capture program as an addition to the Great Green Wall is now being implemented in more than 20 countries across Africa. To date, more than eight billion dollars have been mobilized and pledged for its support internationally. The initiative brings together African countries and international partners under the African Union Commission and Pan-African Agency of the Great Green Wall. Once complete, the Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet - an 8,000 km natural wonder of the world stretching across the entire width of the continent. By 2030, the initiative's ambition is to restore 100 million ha of currently degraded land, sequester 250 million tons of carbon and create 10 million green jobs. This will support communities living along the Wall to: - Grow fertile land, one of humanity's most precious natural assets - Grow economic opportunities for the world's youngest population - Grow food security for the millions that go hungry every day - Grow climate resilience in a region where temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth - Grow a new world wonder spanning 8,000 km across Africa The Nopal Cactus prefers dry well drained gravel to sandy soils, better still in areas of high sunlight and warm temperatures. Hence the degraded areas would be ploughed, thus allowing the planting of the Nopal Cactus as is the practice in Mexico. This is an inexpensive option to protect the environment, begin the rehabilitation of land and soil, and obtain these benefits more efficiently than by the difficult talk of planting trees initially. In fact, planting the Cactus ultimately allows trees to flourish more quickly. Cactus' period to maturity is much shorter and thus benefits the people by producing fruit, vegetables, flour, fertilizer, animal feed, biomass, biofuel, etc. The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Program has already been proven with over 1,450 Hectares under management with the support of the Government of Mexico, which has endorsed the Paris Agreement adopted at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (\"COP\") to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNDCC\") and is taking action to mitigate its Green House Gas (\"GHG') emissions in accordance with the Land Use Protocol of the United Nations (LULUCF), by 2030. ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture program to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which is made up of fifteen member countries located in the Western African region. These countries have both cultural and geopolitical ties and shared common economic interests. ITOCO representatives have been invited by The Government of Nigeria, to join the diplomatic mission as a National Focal Point (NFP) to attend the meeting session COP 26, Glasgow, United Kingdom. Nigeria is a strong proponent and supporter of the principles behind the United Nations Framework Convention (climate change), as well as being one of the largest Petroleum producers in the world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat (UNFCCC Secretariat) requests the customary assistance of Governments to facilitate such participation. The Government of Nigeria has duly nominated ITOCO representatives to attend and present the Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture Offset program at the sessions mentioned above of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.

The building sector plays a decisive role in achieving climate goals: the construction and operation of buildings accounts for almost 40?% of energy-related carbon emissions and more than one third of energy consumption worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UN Climate Change Secretariat is calling for a 'Race to Zero' - reducing emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. The race is against emissions, but also against time.</p><p>Reducing energy consumption in the building sector can play a key part in succeeding. Unfortunately the efforts made so far to cut energy use - the main source of carbon emissions - have not shown results. On the contrary: in the building sector, energy consumption continues to rise.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, one reason is increased use of electrical appliances. While appliances are becoming more efficient, increased use more than cancels out the efficiency gains. Consider the sharp increase in demand for cooling in buildings. Since 1990, annual sales of air conditioners have quadrupled to 135 million units worldwide, and the trend continues upward. Some 1.6 billion units, half of them in the US and China alone, consume 2,000 terawatt hours of electricity each year. That is 2.5 times the annual electricity consumption of the entire African continent.</p><p>Another factor is demographic change: in 2050, around 9.7 billion people will populate the earth, about 2 billion more people than today. They will all need space to live, work and play, causing a disproportionate growth in demand for buildings. Between 2010 and 2018 the world's population grew by just under 10?%, but building space increased by over 20?%. The additional building space created currently amounts to constructing another Paris every five days.</p><p>The longevity of buildings creates enormous challenges, but also opportunities. Half of all the buildings that will exist in 2060 have not yet been built. What we do - or fail to do - today will have an impact on energy use and emissions decades from now. We must act with foresight when planning and building today.</p><p>Range of activities</p><p>That applies to a wide range of activities. In a joint roadmap to 2050, the International Energy Agency and the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, which emerged from the Paris climate summit in 2015, focus on eight areas of activity that should include energy efficiency planning:</p><p> urban planning,</p><p> new buildings,</p><p> renovation of existing buildings,</p><p> building management,</p><p> efficient systems,</p><p> sustainable building materials,</p><p> climate resilience and</p><p> clean energy.</p><p>This wide-ranging list shows that measures such as installing insulation or multiple glazing - which are often seen as the centrepiece of energy efficiency - are only cogs in a larger wheel. In fact, energy efficiency and sustainability should be factored into all decisions related to construction and renovation. Humankind needs an adequate standard, for example when drawing up building codes, setting national climate protection targets or reimbursing costs incurred to improve energy efficiency. We also need a faster rate of retrofitting buildings. The application of new technologies and use of sustainable building materials are imperative too, to name just a few important issues.</p><p>Acting on behalf of Germany's Federal Government, KfW Development Bank is supporting partners in the construction sector in the 'Race to Zero'. KfW's initiatives vary significantly, depending on the partner country, local opportunities and overall conditions. On the other hand, KfW can sometimes contribute to shaping the policy context. One example is Georgia. With substantial financial investment and the experience of many years of successful cooperation, KfW and Georgia have jointly developed high energy efficiency standards that are now implemented in public buildings.</p><p>In India, KfW construction-specific financing is based on standards that the country previously developed with support from Germany's GIZ. KfW's partner is the State Bank of India, the country's largest bank. KfW provides grants for construction measures that reduce energy demand by 40?% compared to conventional technologies. These grants ensure the economic viability of energy-saving measures and provide incentives for widespread implementation. This is very important, as India is number three in the world in terms of energy consumption in the building sector.</p><p>Flagship projects in Montenegro</p><p>In Montenegro, KfW is developing a project for a 'nearly zero energy building' as part of the country's national energy-efficiency programme. Reasons for offering support included the country's proximity to the European Union, its high energy costs and its backlog of renewable energy and building refurbishment projects. Montenegro's EU accession agreement requires the country to modernise an annual one percent of the total state-owned building stock according to efficiency standards. To help Montenegro achieve this goal, KfW will provide subsidised loans to buy modern energy management systems for the country's 2,500 public buildings.</p><p>Thanks to up-to-date sensor and measurement technology, smart electricity metering can automatically monitor the consumption every 15 minutes. It is thus possible to identify major consumers and to save both energy and water. Worldwide experience shows that such systems can reduce energy use by up to 20?%. The city of Frankfurt, where KfW has its headquarters, was the model for Montenegro's new system.</p><p>Apart from cutting buildings' energy use, countries should focus on the sustainability of buildings throughout their lifecycle. Even the most energy-efficient buildings have roofs and walls whose production involves CO2 emissions. The way to eliminate carbon footprints eventually is to use sustainable and locally sourced building materials. KfW promotes that approach. It also promotes the use of solar and photovoltaic roof systems - for example as part of Mexico's 'EcoCasa' project (see box).</p><p>Sanna Stockstrom is a portfolio manager in the Urban and Social Development team at KfW Development Bank.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Matthias Zilbauer s a sector economist in the Competence Centre Climate and Energy at KfW Development Bank.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["We must act with foresight when planning and building today.

If no mitigating action is taken, global temperatures could rise by more than 3\u00b0C and the world economy could shrink by 18% in the next 30 years. But the impact can be lessened if decisive action is taken to meet the targets set in the Paris Agreement, Swiss Re Institute's new Climate Economics Index shows. This will require more than what is pledged today; public and private sectors will play a crucial role in accelerating the transition to net zero.\u00a0 Swiss Re Institute has conducted a stress test to examine how 48 economies would be impacted by the ongoing effects of climate change under four different temperature increase scenarios. As global warming makes the impact of weather-related natural disasters more severe, it can lead to substantial income and productivity losses over time. For example, rising sea levels result in loss of land that could have otherwise been used productively and heat stress can lead to crop failures. Emerging economies in equatorial regions would be most affected by rising temperatures. Major economies could lose roughly 10% of GDP in 30 yearsIn a severe scenario of a 3.2\u00b0C temperature increase, China stands to lose almost one quarter of its GDP (24%) by mid-century. The US, Canada and the UK would all see around a 10% loss. Europe would suffer slightly more (11%), while economies such as Finland or Switzerland are less exposed (6%) than, for example, France or Greece (13%).\u00a0 Thierry L\u00e9ger, Group Chief Underwriting Officer and Chairman of Swiss Re Institute, said: 'Climate risk affects every society, every company and every individual. By 2050, the world population will grow to almost 10 billion people, especially in regions most impacted by climate change. So, we must act now to mitigate the risks and to reach net-zero targets. Equally, as our recent biodiversity index shows, nature and ecosystem services provide huge economic benefits but are under intense threat. That's why climate change and biodiversity loss are twin challenges that we need to tackle as a global community to maintain a healthy economy and a sustainable future.' Climate Economics Index ranks countries' resilience to climate changeAlong with evaluating each country's expected economic impact from climate risks, Swiss Re Institute also ranked each country on its vulnerability to extreme dry and wet weather conditions. In addition, it looked at the country's capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Put together, these findings generate a ranking of countries' resilience to the impacts of climate change.\u00a0 The ranking displays a similar view to the GDP impact analysis: Countries most negatively impacted are often the ones with fewest resources to adapt to and mitigate the effects of rising global temperatures. The most vulnerable countries in this context are Malaysia, Thailand, India, the Philippines and Indonesia. Advanced economies in the northern hemisphere are the least vulnerable, including the US, Canada, Switzerland and Germany.\u00a0 Public and private sectors play a crucial role in accelerating climate action\u00a0Given the consequences highlighted in Swiss Re Institute's analysis, the need for action is indisputable. Coordinated measures by the world's largest carbon emitters are crucial to meet climate targets. The public and private sectors can facilitate and accelerate the transition, particularly regarding sustainable infrastructure investments that are vital to remain below a 2\u00b0C temperature increase. Given the long-term horizon of their liabilities and long-term capital to commit, institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies are also ideally positioned to play a strong role.\u00a0 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist, said: 'Climate change is a systemic risk and can only be addressed globally. So far, too little is being done. Transparency and disclosure of embedded net-zero efforts by governments and the private sector alike are crucial. Only if public and private sectors pull together will the transition to a low-carbon economy be possible. Global cooperation to facilitate financial flows to vulnerable economies is essential. We have an opportunity to correct the course now and construct a world that will be greener, more sustainable and more resilient. Our analysis shows the benefit of investing in a net-zero economy. For example, adding just 10% to the USD 6.3 trillion of annual global infrastructure investments would limit the average temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C. This is just a fraction of the loss in global GDP that we face if we don't take appropriate action.' Mitigating climate change requires a whole menu of measures. More carbon- pricing policies combined with incentives for nature-based and carbon-offsetting solutions are needed, as well as international convergence on taxonomy for green and sustainable investments. As part of financial reporting, institutions should regularly disclose how they plan to achieve the Paris Agreement and net-zero emission targets. Re/insurers also play a role in providing risk transfer capacity, risk knowledge and long-term investment, using their understanding of risk to help households, companies and societies mitigate and adapt to climate change. Notes to editors Methodology of the report The Swiss Re Institute scenario analysis uses insights gained from an existing model by Moody's Analytics, quantifying the gradual impacts of climate change over time, and from research by the World Bank, identifying so-called \"impact channels\", such as the effect of rising temperatures on productivity. Swiss Re Institute's analysis incorporates the uncertainties related to the potential economic impacts of climate change under different scenarios of global temperature increase and at different levels of severity. These uncertainties include additional and typically omitted impact channels, such as potential disruptions to supply chains and trade due to climate change, as well as respective economic sensitivities.

In addition, it looked at the country's capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Put together, these findings generate a ranking of countries' resilience to the impacts of climate change.  The ranking displays a similar view to the GDP impact analysis: Countries most negatively impacted are often the ones with fewest resources to adapt to and mitigate the effects of rising global temperatures. The most vulnerable countries in this context are Malaysia, Thailand, India, the Philippines and Indonesia. Advanced economies in the northern hemisphere are the least vulnerable, including the US, Canada, Switzerland and Germany.  Public and private sectors play a crucial role in accelerating climate action Given the consequences highlighted in Swiss Re Institute's analysis, the need for action is indisputable. Coordinated measures by the world's largest carbon emitters are crucial to meet climate targets. The public and private sectors can facilitate and accelerate the transition, particularly regarding sustainable infrastructure investments that are vital to remain below a 2\\xB0C temperature increase. Given the long-term horizon of their liabilities and long-term capital to commit, institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies are also ideally positioned to play a strong role.  J\\xE9r\\xF4me Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist, said: 'Climate change is a systemic risk and can only be addressed globally. So far, too little is being done. Transparency and disclosure of embedded net-zero efforts by governments and the private sector alike are crucial. Only if public and private sectors pull together will the transition to a low-carbon economy be possible. Global cooperation to facilitate financial flows to vulnerable economies is essential. We have an opportunity to correct the course now and construct a world that will be greener, more sustainable and more resilient.  Our analysis shows the benefit of investing in a net-zero economy. For example, adding just 10% to the USD 6.3 trillion of annual global infrastructure investments would limit the average temperature increase to below 2\\xB0C. This is just a fraction of the loss in global GDP that we face if we don't take appropriate action.'  Mitigating climate change requires a whole menu of measures. More carbon- pricing policies combined with incentives for nature-based and carbon-offsetting solutions are needed, as well as international convergence on taxonomy for green and sustainable investments. As part of financial reporting, institutions should regularly disclose how they plan to achieve the Paris Agreement and net-zero emission targets. Re/insurers also play a role in providing risk transfer capacity, risk knowledge and long-term investment, using their understanding of risk to help households, companies and societies mitigate and adapt to climate change.  Notes to editors  Methodology of the report  The Swiss Re Institute scenario analysis uses insights gained from an existing model by Moody's Analytics, quantifying the gradual impacts of climate change over time, and from research by the World Bank, identifying so-called \"impact channels\", such as the effect of rising temperatures on productivity. Swiss Re Institute's analysis incorporates the uncertainties related to the potential economic impacts of climate change under different scenarios of global temperature increase and at different levels of severity. These uncertainties include additional and typically omitted impact channels, such as potential disruptions to supply chains and trade due to climate change, as well as respective economic sensitivities. A detailed description of the methodology can be found in the report.

Yet it underlined the role of Wangari Maathai's Green Belt Movement in building a peaceful and self-sustained society.How was Wangari Maathai's early life?Wangari Muta Maathai was born in 1940 in Tetu village in the central highlands of Kenya, about 160 kilometers (99 miles) from Kenya's capital city Nairobi. She was among 800 young Africans in the 1960's to study in the United States through the Kennedy Airlift scholarship program.What were Wangari Maathai's achievements in academia?</p><p>She studied biological sciences in the USA, where she drew inspiration from the Civil Rights Movement. Further studies brought her back to Kenya and then to Germany. Maathai was the first woman from East and Central Africa to earn a doctoral degree; she went on to become the first woman associate professor in East and Central Africa. In 1976 Wangari Maathai became chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy at the University of Nairobi, where she took her post as associate professor the following year.How was Wangari Maathai's Green Belt Movement born?Maathai introduced the idea of community-based tree planting that she developed into a broad-based grassroots organization which she named the Green Belt Movement (GBM). The movement was founded in 1977, under the auspices of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), as a response to the energy and water needs of rural women in Kenya. Over the years, Maathai's GBM has planted over 51 million trees in Kenya. Working at the grassroots, national, and international levels, the movement focuses on building climate resilience and empowering communities, especially women, to foster democratic space and sustainable livelihoods.How did Wangari Maathai champion human rights?Maathai is renowned for her fight against land grabbing and for protecting water catchment areas and green spaces in Kenya. In 1989, while Kenya was still under a one party rule led by then President Daniel arap Moi, she led a campaign against the construction of a 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust business complex at Uhuru Park - a 13 hectare (130,000 square meter) public recreational park adjacent to the central business district of Nairobi.A decade later, she led a group of concerned citizens into a confrontation with thugs hired by corrupt developers who were trying to grab Karura Forest - an urban forest gazetted in 1932 located in the capital. Originally measuring 1,041hectares, the reserve has been reduced to 564 hectares due to developers' incursions according to a 2005 Kenyan report on illegal land allocations.Wangari Maathai was also deeply engaged with the struggle for multi-party democracy in her home country. In 1992, the year of the first multi-party elections, Maathai took the lead of a group of defiant mothers who had been on a hunger strike at Uhuru Park in Nairobi. The women together with another political activism group known as Release Political Prisoners (RPP) were demanding the release of their sons confined in prison without trial for politically instigated accusations. The women stripped naked after security officers broke the protest. They remained defiant for almost 11 months after which the government backed down and released the political prisoners. That section of Uhuru Park was later named Freedom Corner to commemorate that incident.After the introduction of multiparty democracy, the Green Belt Movement led by Maathai was instrumental in educating communities on good governance, fostering peace and protecting the environment.How was Wangari Maathai honored for her work?For her groundbreaking achievements, Wangari Maathai was awarded countless prizes, among them the Right Livelihood Award, the Goldman Environmental Prize, the Indira Ghandi Prize and the French Legion of Honor. In 2005, eleven heads of state in the Congo region appointed her the Goodwill Ambassador to the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem.In 2004 she obtained one of the highest honors when the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded her the Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy, and peace in Kenya and in Africa.Give me some of Wangari Maathai's memorable quotes!\"The generation that destroys the environment is not the generation that pays the price. That is the problem.\"\"Human rights are not things that are put on the table for people to enjoy. These are things you fight for and then you protect.\" \"Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its life-support system. We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and, in the process, heal our own - indeed to embrace the whole of creation in all its diversity, beauty and wonder. Recognizing that sustainable development, democracy and peace are indivisible is an idea whose time has come.\" \"I'm very conscious of the fact that you can't do it alone. It's teamwork. When you do it alone you run the risk that when you are no longer there nobody else will do it.\"How is Wangari Maathai remembered?Wangari Maathai died after a battle with ovarian cancer on 25 September 2011, aged 71.In 2012, the African Union designated March 3, as Wangari Maathai Day. The day is observed in conjunction with Africa Environmental Day.In 2016, the Nairobi County Government renamed Forest Road as Prof. Wangari Maathai Road The Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies (WMI) at the University of Nairobi was established to honor, recognize, celebrate, advance, and immortalize the ideals and works of Professor Wangari Maathai.Scientific advice on this article was provided by historians Professor Doulaye Konat, Lily Mafela, Ph.D., and Professor Christopher Ogbogbo.

In response to gradual structural shifts in its markets over recent years, Wickes has a balanced business focusing on three key customer journeys - Local Trade, DIY (together \"Core\") and Do-it-for-me (\"DIFM\").\u00a0Wickes operates from its network of 229 right-sized stores, which support nationwide fulfilment from convenient locations throughout the United Kingdom, and through its digital channels including its website, TradePro mobile app for trade members, and Wickes DIY app. These digital channels allow customers to research and order an extended range of Wickes products and services, arrange virtual and in-person design consultations, and organise convenient home delivery or click-and-collect.\u00a0Forward looking statements\u00a0This announcement may include statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. By their nature forward-looking statements involve opportunity, risk and uncertainty since they relate to future events and circumstances, and actual results may differ materially. Any forward-looking statements in this announcement reflect management's view with respect to future events as at the date of this announcement.\u00a0Business reviewWickes achieved record sales in the first half, benefitting from its market-leading value proposition and underpinned by its uniquely balanced business model. Despite lower market volumes we maintained our track record of achieving market share gains in our Core business, with the growth of our TradePro customer base a particular feature. DIFM ordered sales were up modestly in the first half, with delivered sales benefitting from working through the elevated order book. MarketDespite the full lifting of Covid restrictions in the period compared with the first half last year, many market changes brought about by the pandemic have remained. Many businesses have retained hybrid working practices, increasing the dwell time at home, fuelling further desire for homeowners and tenants to invest in their properties. While there are well-documented challenges facing the consumer, home improvement remains an attractive and large market worth \u00a326.5bn.Market fundamentals remain strong, underpinned by full employment and a healthy property market with the ongoing need for RMI (Repair, Maintenance and Improvement) investment and interest in making properties more energy-efficient, all supporting project work in the home. With high levels of price inflation, driven by global factors including energy inflation and supply chain disruption, market volumes have declined in the first half. Looking forward, our most recent Mood of the Nation survey indicates a moderate slowing of demand for home improvement from its post-Covid levels, order books for the trade remain very strong, with around 25% of those surveyed having order books for 12 months or more.The homeowning demographic into which our Local Trade and DIFM end propositions face also leave us well placed to continue to take share, as do our credentials for value, quality and convenience. Although as yet we have seen little sign of trading down or rising own label participation, our surveys tell us that customers are becoming more discerning on price and are shopping around more. We believe that our value credentials, the strength of the Wickes brand, our simple and clear pricing policy, alongside our 10% flat rate discount to all TradePro members, stand us in good stead as market conditions become more challenging.Our value credentials and the strength of our digital offer are reflected in our TradePro customer base, which has increased by 10,000 per month since the start of the year, a much faster pace of growth than in 2021. Sales through TradePro continue to grow strongly, and we are exploring a number of initiatives to drive basket size and frequency over the next six months.\u00a0Operational progressWe are pleased to have made strong operational progress since demerger, reflected in continued growth in Core market share.During the first half we demonstrated the flexibility of Wickes? operational model, including a number of actions undertaken to both respond to more challenging market conditions and to continue to drive efficiencies within the business to offset increases in our cost base. We have balanced both fixed and flexible resourcing to enable agility to respond to customer demand, leading to efficiencies across both store and distribution centre fulfilment costs. Whilst the first half of 2021 was characterised by high levels of Covid-related costs such as cleaning, social distancing and marshalling, these continued to unwind with the lifting of restrictions during the first half of 2022. LFL sales across the Group were up 0.8% despite very tough comparatives in our Core business. Core LFL revenue was down by 5.5% during the first half, although on a three-year basis Core LFL revenue increased by 36.3%. On a one year basis, Core LFL sales improved in the second quarter from the first quarter, reflecting easing comparatives and the timing of Easter. During the first half we continued to prioritise our price leadership by working closely with our suppliers. We remained committed to managing supply chain inflation responsibly by passing through cash cost increases while maintaining our leading price position.The estimated level of price inflation for the first half was 15%, driven mainly by categories such as timber and cement. We expect inflationary pressures to moderate slightly in the second half as we annualise the pressures seen in products such as timber in the second half of FY 2021, although there remain inflationary pressures in areas that are particularly impacted by the rising cost of energy, such as furnaced products. In 2023, we expect some upward pressure from freight and FX against expectations of a further moderation in supply chain inflation. Despite the well documented industry shortages in certain categories in the first half, our strong supplier relationships, curated range and operational agility served us well to continue to provide customers with the products they need. Together with our price leadership and own brand credentials, we believe our strong focus on availability helped to drive increased awareness of Wickes, as reflected in our Core market share gains and the strong performance in sales to TradePro members, which increased by 20% during the first half.We entered the period with an elevated pipeline of DIFM orders due to the impact of Covid on the ability of our installation teams to deliver projects in the final quarter of 2021. DIFM LFL delivered sales in the first half were 29.7% ahead on a one year basis. Although this was a strong performance, there was still some disruption in the first half from Covid and also some supply chain issues in areas such as appliances.Ordered DIFM sales on a year-on-year basis were stronger in the first quarter, against a period in which our showrooms were closed in 2021, then slowed in Q2 against a rebound in orders in the prior year. As mentioned in our 26 July update, orders have slowed towards the end of the period as customers are taking longer to commit to big ticket purchases. Installation participation was broadly in line with the prior year.There was another strong performance in bathrooms, where new ranges in sanitaryware and accessories, and a wider price architecture have helped to broaden our appeal. Refitted stores also continue to perform strongly in DIFM due to the welcoming nature of new showroom displays. As expected, given improvements in product availability and labour scheduling, we have been working through our elevated order book, although at the half year end it remained considerably ahead of the prior year. Our current expectation is that there will continue to be an elevated level of order book carry over into FY2023, although this will be dependent on order trends in the second half.Winning for TradeOur TradePro membership scheme showed increasing momentum in the period. We enrolled over 60,000 customers in the first half, taking its total membership to 690,000 as we continued to grow the awareness and appeal of the scheme through its compelling proposition. Our local trade customers indicate that they are increasingly conscious of rising material costs and are switching to Wickes for its strong value credentials and simple discount scheme. We also believe the recent addition of 30 minute click-and-collect to our offering has increased the attraction of the scheme during a period where tradespeople are finding ways to most efficiently use their time whilst balancing full order books. We are encouraged that the TradePro members joining the platform during the first half of the year have adopted characteristics in line with previous cohorts recruited to the platform. Sales from TradePro customers in the first half increased by 20% compared to the same period in 2021. Our TradePro customers continue to represent strong strategic value to Wickes in terms of average order value and frequency of visit, and we continue to evolve our offering to drive further loyalty and engagement.Alongside the positive impact of our recent sponsorship of darts coverage on Sky Sports and increasing momentum of TradePro Monday events, we are looking at ways to improve the proposition to leverage the opportunities available within this market as we continue to take market share. To this end, we are encouraged that the results of our August Mood of the Nation survey showed that 56% of tradespeople have a pipeline of work for over three months, broadly unchanged from the start of the year.Accelerating DIFM\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Developing our digital expertise and continuous innovation of our product range continues to be a key focus within DIFM.\u00a0 We completed the major refresh of our kitchen ranges initiated in Autumn 2021, introducing a number of new ranges and trending colourways during the period. This innovation has been carried through to six new ranges of our ?Ready to Fit? offering tailored to the lower budget kitchen market.Following the introduction of a completely new bathroom range during the second half of 2021, we continued to progressively introduce new products to showroom displays. We have also further improved our end-to-end bathroom service by driving greater engagement and endorsement with our design consultants, supported by focused recruitment of installers with bathroom capabilities. Across kitchens and bathrooms our installer network continues to grow and now stands at 2,800 teams of independent contractors (FY 2021: 2,600), enabling Wickes to continue to offer the best available lead times in the market whilst retaining a flexible approach to capacity.We continue to see encouraging attachment rates of tiling, flooring and joinery sales to kitchen and bathroom projects, and trials for new service propositions are confirming the opportunity to extend our DIFM offering to increase overall project spend within the home.DIY Category WinsAs communicated in our most recent trading update, following the Jubilee weekend in June, we experienced signs of the DIY market softening from the very high levels of demand experienced during the pandemic. The outlook remains uncertain, although we continue to outperform the market and expect activity to remain ahead of pre Covid levels.In line with our strategy to capture share in underweight categories, we have grown market share in key categories such as garden and d\u00e9cor following recent range reviews. Most recently this has included the roll out of our new Crown colour emulsion paint range to support greater customer choice across different price points. The continued growth of our extended online range continues to support range depth whilst our curated range in store lends itself to high stock turn and limited exposure to highly seasonal lines and markdown activity across the wider sector. Digital developmentsDespite annualising Covid comparatives we have continued to grow the proportion of our digitally-enabled sales on a year-on-year basis. We completed a number of enhancements to our digital capabilities in the first half, including greater use of push messaging, personalisation and targeted campaigns across our digital channels. Underpinned by our predictive Missions Motivation Engine, we have also stepped up the digital experience for our trade customers, increasing the levels of engagement throughout the project journey. Increased usage of social campaigns and display marketing has also grown the awareness of the TradePro mobile app.During the first half of the year we successfully launched our WickeseBay store with 4,000 lines, extending our customer reach. We are currently looking at ways to expand our relationship with marketplace platforms including eBay to further grow our range accessibility with a wider audience of home improvers. \u00a0Growing our estate of new format stores Four store refits were completed during the first half of the year in Chadwell Heath, Oxford, Wimbledon and Stirchley. Our refitted stores benefit from an improved order fulfilment space which increases our home delivery capacity by over 10% per store. Implementation of our latest store service proposition allows store managers to better implement more efficient management of volumes and cost. Despite the impact of heightened build costs during the first half, store investments continue to deliver sales uplifts of over 25% and ROCE also of over 25%. Two further refits have been completed in Q3 to date, and we expect to complete 11 during the financial year as a whole.Our property team is reviewing and stress testing a number of white space opportunities and we remain confident on the opportunity to expand our proven model into 20 new locations over the next five years. We expect to open a new store in Bolton in the second half.\u00a0\u00a0IT separationFollowing initial mobilisation during the previous financial year, we continue to see good progress with the transition of technology and processes from our previous parent Travis Perkins plc. Projects completed in the first half of the year were all successful, allowing us to remain on track to complete the separation of the IT infrastructure within two years of the demerger. All aspects of the programme continue to be overseen by the Wickes Executive and PLC Board who monitor delivery and mitigate any operational risk arising.\u00a0Responsible Business StrategyLaunched as part of our first Annual Report, our Responsible Business Strategy is now embedding across all aspects of our business, to deliver our goals of Supporting a diverse and inclusive society, an environment protected for the next generation, and homes fit for a sustainable future for everyone.PeopleInclusion and Diversity remains central to our people strategy. We have relaunched our I&amp;D networks with a new look and feel as part of our \"Feel at home\" campaign, and also repositioned our Youth Board as the Forward Focus Network, aimed at supporting sustainability, communication, and development across the business. Our Charity programme which has supported Young Minds, our charity partner, has hosted a series of fundraising events including a Paddle the Thames challenge, and a 50p ask for customers, taking us ever closer to our \u00a32m fundraising target. We have also supported efforts in Ukraine with colleagues collecting donations, and a small team of colleagues driving to Ukraine to deliver them where they are needed most. Our Community programme has grown from strength to strength, supporting over 34830 organisations to date, with 168 of our stores taking part in the programme. We have donated over \u00a375,000 worth of products and supported over 28,000 people through these initiatives. EnvironmentWith our continued focus on Carbon and Climate, we have refined our Greenhouse Gas Inventory as part of our work to submit Science Based Targets in September, providing us with a more detailed and precise understanding of the emissions within our business. We have also conducted climate risk and resilience workshops, to build on our TCFD work in 2021, with a focus on building climate resilience within our operations and supply chain, as well as new focus areas for our next TCFD report. Addressing our operational sustainability needs has been another key focus area, with new Energy and Environment networks and learning pages established for colleagues to upskill, as well as launching an energy efficiency drive, with a focus on store electricity and gas consumption across the estate. We have been engaging with landlords to understand their own ESG agendas, and working to identify areas of improvement in our stores, including sites suitable for solar panels, and new air source heat pumps. We are also addressing our transportation emissions, by launching a new corporate car policy which looks to deliver a hybrid and then electric fleet over the next three years, as well as continuing to explore low carbon opportunities within our store and home delivery networks. HomesAs one of our growth pillars, sustainable products and services will be central to our business strategy over the coming years. We have spent the first half of the year mapping out the sustainability credentials of all of our products, and are working on a taxonomy and labelling strategy that will enable customers to make more informed decisions about the products they purchase, and their environmental impact. We are also looking to support customers in the challenges around the cost of living crisis, with a focus on energy efficiency in the Home. This will include improving the information and guidance available to customers in store and online, and being a partner for home decarbonisation. We will continue to deliver on our packaging commitments, to increase the recycled content in our packing, make it easier to recycle, and reduce its quantities.Financial reviewWe are pleased to report another period of sales growth and market share gains (source: GfK), building on our long term track record. LFL sales for the period were ahead by 0.8% against very tough comparatives in our Core business. Adjusted operating profit declined moderately with another strong focus on costs partially offsetting a lower gross margin as a result of inflation and mix factors. Adjusted pre-tax profit was only marginally down, reflecting higher FX hedging gains. Profit before tax in the first half also declined, reflecting the modest reduction in adjusted pre-tax profit, and slightly higher adjusting items year on year relating to IT separation.The business continued to generate cash with period end net cash of \u00a3166.5m, also reflecting seasonal working capital movements.RevenueRevenue for the 26 weeks to 2 July 2022 was \u00a3822.3m, an increase of 1.3% on the prior year. Against tough comparatives, Core sales declined by 5.1% to \u00a3632.6m, with DIFM delivered sales increasing by 30.6% to \u00a3189.7m, reflecting a disrupted H1 2021 in which showrooms were closed for several weeks. The shift in the first half calendar this year following the 53rd week last year added \u00a35.4m to reported sales, and there was a modest reduction in the contribution from space from the closure of three stores. Comparable period LFL sales (weeks 1-26 this year versus weeks 2-27 last year) increased by 0.8%.Core LFL revenue declined by 5.5% over the period, although was 36.3% ahead on a three-year basis. Our long term trend of market share gains continued in the first half (source: GfK), with particularly strong performances in hardware, decorative and garden. Our performance strengthened from Q1 into Q2 both on a one-year and three-year basis, although, as mentioned in our trading update of 26 May 2022, some of the one-year improvement was the result of a later Easter in 2022.Commodity cost inflation continued to accelerate during the period, with pressure in heat-sensitive categories such as tiling, cement and insulation more than offsetting some moderation in the rate of inflation in timber. We continue to pass through cash cost increases to customers, while maintaining our competitive price position. Retail price inflation for the period was 15%, compared with 3% in the first half of 2021. The pricing outlook for the second half remains uncertain, although at this stage we would expect some moderation in the rate of retail price inflation against the second half of last year when inflation first moved into double digits (H1 2021 3%, H2 11%).Within Core, local trade sales remained strong in the first half, with our TradePro customer base increasing by 60,000 to 690,000 during the period. As of early September, this was over 710,000. Feedback from our monthly Mood of the Nation survey suggests that order books remain buoyant. As a measure of this, 24% of our trade customers have order books of over 12 months or longer, slightly higher than the January reading.The same survey shows trade customers are seeking to offset the impact of higher prices wherever possible. This includes using digital channels to seek better value, and this may also be a key driver of the acceleration in TradePro sign ups during the period. We have yet to see any significant change in the proportion of sales from Wickes? excellent value own label products, although, given our strong Wickes brand heritage, we are well placed to benefit here if inflation remains at high levels.As mentioned in our trading update of 26 July 2022, sales in DIY categories weakened towards the end of the period. Our survey data also showed a modest increase in the proportion of customers planning to delay or cancel projects. Although there may be seasonal factors here, such as weather and holiday patterns, some may be a result of the current pressures on disposable income and are therefore expected to continue into the second half of the year.Delivered DIFM LFL revenue increased by 29.7% in the first half, driven by an increase in ordered sales and the build-out of the elevated order book carried over from 2021. We continue to make good progress in working through the order book, although there was slightly more disruption than expected from Covid infection rates and also supply chain issues. The latter revolves predominantly around the computer chips used in appliances, with installation times now falling towards more normal levels. Cancellation rates remain low as many projects and peers are affected by the same issues.The order book has now started to decline in absolute terms, although at period end remains ahead year-on-year and roughly double pre-Covid levels. Our current expectation is that there will be some order book carry over into 2023, although the extent of this will depend on order trends in the second half.We have continued to see a strong performance in the bathroom category, as we build on our position as the only national retailer and installer. Product ranges have been extended to offer more choice, both in terms of sanitaryware and accessories. Kitchen sales were more affected by the slower conversion issues referred to above. Installation participation was broadly in line with the prior year.Gross profitGross profit for the first half was \u00a3292.6m, down from \u00a3294.8m last year. Gross profit % declined by 70bp to 35.6%, a similar rate of decline to that seen in FY2021. The key drivers were again inflation and product mix, the latter reflecting a higher mix of TradePro sales.We have a consistent strategy of passing inflationary cost price increases through to customers on a cash recovery basis, whilst maintaining a competitive price position. This negatively affects the percentage gross margin. Mix effects continue to be adverse for margin percentage, with rising trade sales offered at a 10% trade discount. Mix effects within Core were in part offset by growth of DIFM within total sales.Lower distribution costs reflect the fact that some costs are volume, not value linked, allowing some improvement in ratios despite inflation in related costs. Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit was \u00a356.3m, down 9.0% on the \u00a361.9m reported in the first half last year. Incremental profit from the strong recovery in DIFM sales was broadly offset by a lower contribution from Core as a result of lower LFL sales, with cost inflation and investment costs driving the reduction in profitability.Our adjusted operating profit margin was 6.8%, down from 7.6% last year. The majority of the 80bp decline was from the 70bp decline in the gross margin as noted above. The cost to sales ratiowas broadly flat, with a number of influences here. Underlying cost inflation in areas such as minimum wage and transport costs were higher than headline LFL of 0.8%. Against this, some costs are volume rather than value related, providing opportunities to reduce cost ratios. In addition, there was an additional \u00a33.5m of plc costs compared with only a part-period charge last year. Selling costs increased by \u00a32.1m year on year, driven by the recovery in DIFM revenues and associated commissions. Administrative expenses were up \u00a31.3m, with increases in Support Centre costs (inflation and plc costs), IT and Marketing in part offset by a reduction in bonus accrual after the increase experienced last year.Net finance costsNet finance costs were \u00a310.7m, down from \u00a315.4m last year. The main driver here was a \u00a33.8m increase in unrealised FX gains as a result of the appreciation of the USD during the period, which will either be realised or reversed in due course depending on exchange rate movements. IFRS16 lease interest was \u00a314.9m, down from \u00a315.7m in the prior year.Adjusted profit before taxAfter finance costs adjusted profit before tax for the first half was \u00a345.6m, a decline of 1.9%. Excluding unrealised FX gains, the decline was 10.2%.Adjusting itemsPre-tax adjusting item charges for the first half were \u00a312.1m, up from \u00a310.8m in the prior year. Costs associated with IT separation were \u00a312.1m, up from \u00a35.4m in the prior year as the programme was stepped up after separation from Travis Perkins. The first half last year also included \u00a35.4m of demerger costs.Tax on adjusting items in the 26 weeks ended 26 June 2021 and the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2021 includes a credit of \u00a36.8m arising from the increase in the rate of UK corporation tax effective from 1 April 2023 from 19% to 25%. The legislation enacting this rate increase was substantively enacted prior to 26 June 2021.Profit before taxProfit before tax in the first half was \u00a333.5m, compared with \u00a335.7m in the prior year. The decline reflects the modest reduction in adjusted pre-tax profit, and slightly higher adjusting items year on year relating to IT separation.TaxTax for the period is charged on profit before tax, based on the forecast effective tax rate for the full financial year.\u00a0 The underlying effective tax rate (before adjusting items) for the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 is 19.5% (26 weeks ended 26 June 2021: 21.1%, 53 weeks ended 1 January 2021: 19.4%).Capital investmentCapital investment in the first half totalled \u00a321.6m. The main components were \u00a39.6m investment in the store estate, of which refits were \u00a35.5m. Separately, there was a \u00a36.1m investment in one freehold at Braintree. There was also \u00a35.1m of investment in our digital IT capability. In the second half, we expect to further accelerate capital investment into our IT capabilities and refit activity. We continue to expect FY 2022 capex to be \u00a340-45m. Cash / net debtNet cash in the first half was \u00a3166.5m, reflecting strong operating cash flow and the favourable impact of the normal working capital cycles in the business. Investment in IT separation projects and our growth levers is weighted to the second half, and, together with the normal seasonal working capital unwind, there will be a cash outflow in the second half. The inventory position of \u00a3205.5m compared with \u00a3162.4m in the prior year, due to the impact of product inflation and build up of stock in the second half of 2021 to mitigate against supply issues. Despite lower Core sales, stock turn remained strong at 4.3x, reflecting efficient management of stockholding.IFRS 16 net debt reduced to \u00a3558.5m, driven by a fall in lease liabilities to \u00a3725.0m due to the low level of lease renewals during the period. On a last twelve month basis, IFRS16 leverage was 2.6x compared with our target of consistently below 2.75x. However, as noted, we expect cash balances to moderate by the year end, while in addition there will be some impact from lower full year profitability reflected in our current guidance. As such, we expect year end leverage to be somewhat higher than the half year figure.DividendThe Board has declared an interim dividend of 3.6p, which will be paid on 4 November 2022 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 30 September 2022. The shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 29 September 2022. Shareholders in the UK may elect to reinvest their dividend in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 14 October 2022.We recognise the importance of cash returns to our shareholders, and, at our FY 2021 results, we announced an enhanced payout ratio of 40% of adjusted profit after tax, with approximately one third to typically be paid as an interim dividend. While there are well-documented headwinds for the sector to navigate, given the cash generative nature of our business and the strength of our balance sheet, and on the basis that adjusted profit before tax falls within the current guidance range, we intend to maintain the full year dividend per share at last year?s level.In the current year the payout ratio will thus rise above 40%, but over time we would look to return to this level.Appendix</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"11\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec

financial statements \u00a0  \u00a0 General information and accounting policies The condensed consolidated interim financial statements (?interim financial statements?) have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that certain financial instruments including derivative instruments are stated at their fair value. The interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries (?the Group?). Basis of preparation The financial information for the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 and 26 June 2021 is unaudited. The 2 July 2022 information has been reviewed by KPMG LLP, the Group's auditor, and a copy of their review report appears on pages 26 and 27 of this interim report.\u00a0 The June 2021 information was also reviewed by KPMG LLP.The comparative figures for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022 do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 1 January 2022, as prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts (i) was unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report, and (iii) did not contain statements under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. This condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted for use in the UK.The latest annual financial statements of the group were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the next annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published consolidated financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022.Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the Directors consider appropriate for the following reasons.Although the Group saw some weakening of sales and cost pressures at the end of the period due to the ongoing cost of living crisis, the Group continues to demonstrate the flexibility of Wickes? operational model, including a number of actions undertaken to both respond to more challenging market conditions and to continue to drive efficiencies within the businessThe Group manages its day-to-day working capital requirements through cash generated from its operating activities and its existing cash reserves. In March 2021 the Group negotiated a three year revolving credit facility of \u00a380m with associated covenants, with a one year further extension of this facility negotiated in March 2022. As at the date of approval of these interim financial statements the revolving credit facility remains undrawn.The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts, including a severe but plausible downside scenario, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements. These forecasts indicate that the Group is able to continue to operate and remain undrawn on its Revolving Credit Facility. The Directors however remain watchful of ongoing pressures on customers and suppliers given the current economic environment, and are aware that the Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could affect the Group?s ability to meet its forecasts.The Directors believe that the Group has the flexibility to react to changing market conditions and is adequately placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have undertaken a detailed going concern assessment which entails assessing the Group?s current and projected financial performance and position, including current assets and liabilities, debt maturity profile, future commitments and forecast cash flows. The downside scenario tested, outlining the impact of a severe but plausible adverse scenario based on a severe recession and housing market weakness, shows that there  General information and accounting policies (continued) is sufficient liquidity headroom and the Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn \u00a0for at least the next 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements.Consequently, the directors are confident that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. New and amended standards adopted by the Group There are no new or amended standards applicable for the current reporting period. Adjusting items Adjusting items are those items of income and expenditure that, by reference to the Group, are material in size or unusual in nature or incidence and that in the judgement of the Directors should be disclosed separately on the face of the financial statements to ensure both that the reader has a proper understanding of the Group?s financial performance and that there is comparability of financial performance between periods.Items of income or expense that are considered by the Directors for designation as adjusting items include, but are not limited to, significant restructurings, significant write downs or impairments of current and non-current assets, the costs of demerging and listing the business, the associated costs of separating the business from the Travis Perkins Group?s IT systems, and the effect of changes in corporation tax rates on deferred tax balances.To enable a reader of the interim financial statements to obtain a fuller understanding of the underlying trading and to allow comparability between periods and give a better indication of potential future periods, the Directors have presented the items below separately in the income statement.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\"

These costs have included the costs of creating standalone versions of already existing systems, of transferring data from Travis Perkins systems onto these standalone systems, of upgrading some older legacy systems to newer ?software as a service? solutions, and of managing the project. Costs related to maintenance and licence of existing systems are included in underlying trading as these costs will continue after the separation project is concluded: where costs meet the definition of an intangible asset they have been capitalised, and future amortisation will be included in underlying trading. Demerger related costs Demerger related costs are the costs incurred during the process of demerging the Wickes business from the Travis Perkins plc group, excluding IT related costs which are shown separately due to their significance. Costs predominantly relate to professional services fees and all costs were incurred in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0  Store impairment charge In the period ended 1 January 2022, an impairment charge of \u00a31.1m was recognised on stores that had previously been identified as impaired in 2020. \u00a31.0m of impairment charges identified in 2020 were reversed due to the improved performance of the stores.In the period ended 26 December 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic and related government restrictions implemented on 23 March 2020 was considered an impairment trigger and as a result all stores were tested for impairment. These impairment reviews resulted in a \u00a312.1m impairment charge in respect of right-of-use assets, which were the only material assets of these stores at that time.The nature of the original impairments, given that they arose due to the pandemic, was considered to arise from a one-off or unusual event, and the impairment in the financial year ended 26 December 2020 was therefore recognised within adjusting items. In order to be consistent, revisions to these previous impairment charges, including both reversals of impairment and further impairments, have been recognised within adjusting items.In a portfolio of stores there will be, from time to time, impairments rising on certain specific stores that do not arise from such a one off event, but arise from underlying trading performance. These impairments are therefore included within adjusted profit. In the 26 week period ended 2 July 2022, no impairment charge has been recognised either within adjusted profit or adjusting items. Deferred tax rate change The tax charge includes an adjusting credit of \u00a3nil (26 weeks ended 26 June 2021: \u00a36.8m, 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022: \u00a36.7m) arising from the increase in the rate of UK corporation tax effective from 1 April 2023 from 19% to 25%. The legislation enacting this rate increase was substantively enacted prior to 26 June 2021.\u00a0 \u00a0 Revenue The Group has one operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 ?Operating Segments?, which is the retail of home improvement products and services, both in stores and online.The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors of Wickes Group plc. Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a regular basis. Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.The Group identifies two distinct revenue streams within its operating segment which are analysed below.Both activities operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom. The Group?s revenue is driven by a large number of individual small value transactions and as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Revenue (continued) Revenue reconciliation and like-for-like sales</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_15\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a3m</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">26 weeks ended2 July 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">26 weeks ended\u00a026 June 2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">53 weeks ended1 January 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">822.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">812.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,534.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Core (product sales)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">632.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">666.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,234.7</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Do-it-for-me (project sales)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">189.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">145.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">300.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Network change</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(0.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(0.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(0.4)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other movements</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(17.6)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue (like-for-like basis)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">822.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">811.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,516.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">812.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">612.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,346.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period network change</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(2.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(2.7)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(4.8)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period other movements</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period revenue (like-for-like basis)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(815.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(610.0)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(1,342.1)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Increase / (decrease) arising on a like-for-like basis</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">201.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">174.8</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Like-for-like Sales Growth (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.8%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">13.0%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Core (product sales) Like-for-like Sales Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(5.5)%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">36.2%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">14.2%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Do-it-for-me (project sales) Like-for-like Sales Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">29.7%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">8.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Calculating like-for-like sales enables management to monitor the performance trend of the business period-on-period. It also gives management a good indication of the health of the business compared to competitors.Like-for-like sales are a measure of sales performance for two successive periods. Branches contribute to like-for-like sales once they have been trading for more than twelve months. Revenue included in like-for-like sales is for the equivalent times in both years being compared. When branches close revenue is excluded from the prior year figures for the months equivalent to the post closure period in the current year.Other movements represent the impact of the fact that the financial year ended 1 January 2022 is a 53 week period, whereas the financial year ended 26 December 2020 was 52 weeks; the extra week is presented separately to enable direct comparison.\u00a0 The Prior period other movements represent the impact of the fact that the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 is not aligned to the 26 weeks ended 26 June 2021; the sum disclosed separately reflects the removal of the week 1 revenue and addition of the week 27 revenue to enable direct comparison. \u00a0 \u00a0 Net finance costs Net finance costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_16\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a3m</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">26 weeks ended 2 July 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">26 weeks ended26 June 2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">53 weeks ended1 January 2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Current tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- current year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.9</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">12.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- prior year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(0.1)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total current tax charge</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.9</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">12.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deferred tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- current year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(6.0)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- prior year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total deferred tax credit</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(5.7)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total tax charge</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">6.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tax for the interim period is charged on profit before tax, based on the best estimate of the corporate tax rate for the full financial year.

The claim arose due to output VAT being paid in error on zero and reduced rate products and relates to the period from Q3 2018 to Q1 2022. This matter is subject to review by HMRC, and whilst the directors believe that a favourable outcome is probable, with management?s current best estimate of the amount to be recovered being \u00a33.6m, the receipt of the amount is contingent on the outcome of HMRC?s review and their subsequent agreement to reimburse the company, which at this stage is not virtually certain.As a result this amount has not been recognised in these interim financial statements. Related party transactions  The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, with its Directors and up to the date of the demerger had related party relationships with Travis Perkins Group companies. There have been no related party transactions with Directors other than in respect of remuneration. Transactions with the Travis Perkins Group companies relate to the purchase of goods and lease arrangements before the demerger date of 28 April 2021 and are detailed below. The Travis Perkins Group companies ceased to be related parties after the demerger date and therefore there are no further related party transactions after that date, although payments continue to be made under the Transitional Services Agreement with Travis Perkins on an arms? length basis.  Related party purchases of \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a30.9m) were made from other entities in the Travis Perkins group, of which \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021:\u00a30.4m, 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a3nil) remained due at the period-end. Related party rental payments of \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a30.9m) were made to other entities in the Travis Perkins group, of which \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a3nil) remained due at the period-end. Related party rental income of \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a30.4m) was received, of which \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a3nil) remained due at the period-end.

However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern, and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group will continue in operation. Directors? responsibilities  The Interim Results 2022 is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.\u00a0 The directors are responsible for preparing the Interim Results 2022 in accordance with the DTR of the UK FCA.As disclosed in note 1, the latest annual financial statements of the group were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the next annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\u00a0 The directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of financial statements included in the Interim Results 2022 in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted for use in the UK.In preparing the condensed set of financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group?s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\u00a0 Our responsibility  Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the Interim Results 2022 based on our review.\u00a0 Our conclusion, including our conclusions relating to going concern, are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report. The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities This report is made solely to the company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the company in meeting the requirements of the DTR of the UK FCA.\u00a0 Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose.\u00a0 To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.\u00a0Andrew Cawthrayfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP Chartered AccountantsOne SnowhillSnow Hill QueenswayBirminghamB4 6GH\u00a014 September 2022 \u00a0  Source: GfK GB PoS data, sourced from GfK DIY Category Reporting June 2022  For a definition of LFL sales, see note 3 of the interim financial statements \u00a0 cost to sales ratio is the total of Selling costs and Administrative expenses as a proportion of Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_30\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"256\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"368\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ISIN:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">GB00BL6C2002</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Category Code:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">TST</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TIDM:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">WIX</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LEI Code:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">213800IEX9ZXJRAOL133</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sequence No.:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">188205</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EQS News ID:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1442801</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_31\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_32\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"336\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">End of Announcement</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EQS News Service</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_33\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "EQS Newsfeed (English)", "instances": ["We have donated over \u00a375,000 worth of products and supported over 28,000 people through these initiatives.

Had  we applied  the same  increased level of interim dividend throughout 2021, this would have resulted in an annual dividend yield  of 2.3%.(1) From here, we expect  to continue extending our 55-year track record of annual dividend increases.\"   * In 2021 the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) amounted to 16.5%; its     Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return was 18.6% while the Company's benchmark     index returned 19.6%.   * Performance in the year was significantly ahead of the Company's benchmark     index until the fourth quarter when the index returns became dominated by     the performance of a few of the largest US technology companies.   * The Investment Manager and your Board are confident that the fundamental     characteristics of the portfolio mean that we expect it to generate     outperformance over the longer term.   * A significant increase in dividends was introduced for the third and fourth     interim dividends resulting in a year-on-year total increase of 32.5%; had     we increased the first and second interim dividends to the same level, this     would have resulted in an annual dividend yield of 2.3%.(1)   * We expect to continue extending our 55-year track record of increasing     dividends. 1. This is based on the Company's share price on 31 December 2021. Stock  markets generally posted strong gains in  2021, led once again by the US, as  the global economy initially  continued its recovery from  the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  However,  in  the  fourth  quarter,  with  volatile markets, inflation  pressures building and further variants  of the virus emerging, there was  new uncertainty about the outlook for 2022. As a result, valuations of many stocks  suffered in  this period  and most  of the  performance of the benchmark index  in the final quarter of the year  was generated by a very small number of large   US  technology  stocks.  Overall  performance  and  the  effect  of  the concentration  of  market  returns  is  further  analysed  in  the report of our Investment Manager, WTW, on pages 11 to 15 of the Annual Report. As  a result of  the above factors,  the performance of  the Company's portfolio relative  to its benchmark  declined materially during  the final quarter of the year.  For the  first nine  months of  the year,  as the  vaccine-fuelled market recovery  broadened in impact,  the Company's NAV  Total Return outperformed the benchmark  by 3.4%. Although the Company's portfolio  included some of the large US  technology stocks  it did  not mirror  the degree  of concentration  of such stocks   in   the   benchmark   index.   This   resulted  in  NAV  Total  Return underperformance  relative  to  the  index  of  4.0% in  the  fourth quarter. To illustrate  the  extreme  nature  of  this  concentration,  if the portfolio had included  Apple and Tesla at  the same weight as  the benchmark, the portfolio's performance would have improved by approximately 1.0% in the fourth quarter. This  concentration factor has harmed the performance of the Company relative to the  benchmark for significant  periods over recent  years. This has resulted in the  portfolio underperforming relative to the  benchmark index, and against our target,  since 1 April 2017 when  WTW was appointed  as the Company's Investment Manager.  In  this  period,  excluding  the  effect  of  non-equity  investments previously  held by the  Company, the Company's  annualised NAV Total Return was 0.45% per annum below its benchmark return. In  the past year we have seen  encouraging signs that when the individual stock returns from global markets are less concentrated and focus on long-term company fundamentals,  returns from our portfolio exceed  those of the market index. The Board  and  WTW  remain  confident  that  over  the  longer  term  the Company's diversified but high conviction portfolio is well placed to provide the level of outperformance we target. We announced a number of changes to our Stock Pickers during the year. Following the  termination of Lomas Capital Management's  mandate in February we appointed Sands Capital Management and Metropolis Capital. If and when any further changes are  made, we will announce these once  the transition of assets to the relevant Stock Pickers has been completed. The  discount remained stable for most of the year closing at 5.3% (2020: 3.5%) and  averaging 5.9%. The  Company bought  back just  over 4% of its issued share capital  during the year. The  widening of the discount  is consistent with many other global equity investment trusts. DIVIDEND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED During  2021 the  Board  completed  a  review  of  the  level and funding of the Company's  dividend. After taking account  of the Company's projected investment income  and  significant  accumulated  distributable  reserves,  enhanced by the conversion  of the merger  reserve, the Board  determined it was appropriate and prudent  to  increase  significantly  the  Company's  dividend.  This  has  been implemented  without changing  the Company's  investment objective  or strategy. Before   making   this   decision,   the  Board  sought  views  from  individual shareholders, institutional investors and wealth managers. The  total dividend paid for 2021 will be 19.05p (2020: 14.38p), representing an increase  of 32.5% on that  paid for 2020. For  illustration, if the Company had paid  all interim dividends during  the year at the  same level as the increased third  and fourth interim  dividends, the annual  dividend yield would have been 2.3%(1). Following this increase, through a combination of its investment income and  the use  of its  significant distributable  reserves, the  Board expects to continue  extending the Company's 55-year track record of dividend increases. Of the  Company's  \\xA33.3bn  distributable  reserves  at  31 December 2021, the Board anticipates  that \\xA310.5m  (2020: \\xA310.1m)  will be  utilised to support the total dividend  declared for  2021. The Board  believes that  delivering a higher, but still  sustainable,  level  of  dividend  will benefit existing shareholders and enhance the attractiveness of the Company's shares. INVESTING RESPONSIBLY In  2021 we reaffirmed our  focus on Environmental,  Social and Governance (ESG) factors  through  announcing  a  formal  commitment,  along  with our Investment Manager,  that  the  Company's  portfolio  will  be  managed  to target net zero greenhouse  gas emissions by  2050. In addition, the  aim is to reduce emissions over  the medium term on  a pathway which may  not necessarily show year-on-year improvements  but one that will still be  consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  You  can  read  more  about  the  practical  implications  of  these commitments in our Investment Manager's report on page 24 of the Annual Report. While  we  would  much  rather  encourage  positive change through the Company's stewardship  and engagement activities, we will consider excluding certain types of  stocks from its portfolio. For example, in July we decided to exclude stocks with  significant  exposure  to  thermal  coal  or producing oil from tar sands. Thermal  coal is by far the most  carbon-emitting source of energy in the global fuel  mix, and tar sands are among  the most carbon-intensive means of crude oil production.  If  we  believe  that  positive  change  cannot be brought about by engagement  alone, we may decide to impose further restrictions on the stocks in which the portfolio may be invested. BOARD CHANGES AND SUCCESSION PLANNING I  was pleased  to welcome  Sarah Bates  and Dean  Buckley to the Board in March 2021. These  appointments added  to the  Board's existing  skills and expertise. Sarah  took on the role of Senior  Independent Director when Karl Sternberg, who joined  the Board  in 2015, stood  down in  June 2021 as  part of  the Company's succession  plans. Chris Samuel, who became a Director at the same time as Karl, will  not seek re-election at the  2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and Anthony Brooke,  the third of our Directors  appointed in 2015, will complete his tenure at  the 2023 AGM. I would like to reiterate my thanks to Karl and to thank Chris for  the significant and continuing  contribution he has made  to the Board over the last six and half years. We  are mindful  that the  Board is  currently all  white and all British. As we refresh  the Board,  in addition  to ensuring  that we  have a  diverse range of individuals  with the necessary skills and knowledge, we are aiming to achieve a more  ethnically diverse  Board by  2024 or earlier.  This is  in line  with the recommendations of the Parker Review. In  accordance with our  succession plan, we  anticipate recruiting at least one further  Director  during  2022, which  will  both  enhance the Board's existing skills and help us achieve this aim. ENGAGING WITH SHAREHOLDERS The  increased  use  of  online  meetings  and  webinars  allowed the Company to continue  to engage  with its  stakeholders throughout  the year. During 2021 we conducted three online webinars and the number of shareholders receiving regular updates increased to over 14,000. It  was disappointing  that due  to Covid-related  government restrictions I was again unable to welcome shareholders to the Company's AGM. I am hoping that will not  be the case in 2022. We  will be holding our AGM  in Dundee and, subject to there  being no restrictions in place at  the time, shareholders will be welcome to  attend. In any  event we will  stream the AGM  live to shareholders and they will  be able to  submit questions in  advance or during  the meeting. If we are unable  to address  all questions  during the  meeting, we  will answer  them in writing  afterwards  and  details  of  all  the  questions  and  answers will be published  on the Company's website. Full details of how to view the meeting and submit  questions will be sent  to all shareholders and  will be on our website. After the formal meeting  we will be  holding a webinar  where shareholders will  be able to hear presentations  from not  just WTW  but also  from Metropolis  Capital and Vulcan Value Partners, two of the Company's Stock Pickers. We will keep shareholders updated on arrangements for the AGM, webinar and other investor  events through our website. You can also sign up to receive details of events  and the  Company's monthly  factsheet and  quarterly newsletter  via the website. OUTLOOK We  note with concern the events in Ukraine taking place as we write this report and  the potential consequences this  will have. It is  difficult to predict how this will impact on global markets. At its core, our portfolio in aggregate, contains companies that are now cheaper and  have stronger  and more  stable earnings  potential than the benchmark. The Board  and  WTW  believes  that  as  Omicron-variant  related  fears recede, and provided  that longer-term fundamentals come back  into focus, this will provide the  environment for our portfolio to outperform.  We have seen some evidence of this  in early 2022 with the broadening of  index returns. WTW believes that the domination  of the market  by so few  companies is unlikely  to persist over the longer term. This should provide further opportunities for our Stock Pickers and portfolio to deliver outperformance. Gregor Stewart Chairman 24 February 2022 INVESTMENT MANAGER'S REPORT INVESTMENT YEAR 2021 2021 was  a strong  year for  equity returns.  It began  on a  positive tone for global  markets as vaccine  rollouts gained pace  and the reopening of economies boosted investor sentiment. The broad economic recovery meant that value stocks, small  to mid-cap areas of the market,  and stocks which are more cyclical fared better than the large-cap US-based growth companies, which had dominated returns for  much of the pandemic. However, this market rotation and move away from 'big tech'  was short-lived, as US large-cap  growth stocks rebounded in June leaving value stocks and smaller and mid-cap companies lagging again. This reversal was, in  part, due to  comments from the  US Federal Reserve  suggesting it might act sooner  to control inflation, causing investors  to pile back into long-duration growth  names under the assumption that  inflation would be temporary. The trend towards  large-cap US stocks was significantly  amplified in the last quarter by concerns over the new Omicron variant. A  mix of additional worries emerged: fears of further lockdowns, global supply- chain  problems and regulatory shocks in  China. Emerging markets equity returns were  weighed down by China's cataclysmic  sell-off in the second quarter during their  government's  regulatory  crackdown  on  Chinese  private  education  and technology companies. This was later amplified by fears that Chinese real estate giant, Evergrande Group, might default. Our portfolio's exposure to some Chinese companies detracted value during this period. Inflation  as an  ongoing theme  continued throughout  the year,  with increases leading  the market to debate whether this was transitory or stickier in nature. By  its final meeting of 2021, the  Federal Open Market Committee announced that it  would end the  emergency quantitative easing  programme a few months earlier than  had been expected, in a bid to curb elevated levels of inflation. Fears of rising  interest  rates  pushed  investors  out  of  growth  stocks in December, impacting  some,  but  not  all  growth  players as many large technology stocks continued to outperform. Arguably one of the biggest impacts on markets in 2021 was the growing influence of  retail investors. This  was particularly true  in the US, where individuals' stimulus  cheques(1) were  used to  support the  equity markets. This became big news  in the  early part  of the  year, as  GameStop share  price volatility hit headlines,  and  remained  a  key  presence  throughout. Another example was the special  purpose acquisition company (SPAC)(2), Digital World Acquisition Corp., that  saw shares  soaring nearly  1,000% following the  announcement of a merger with  Trump Media &amp;  Technology Group Corp.  Retail investors strongly supported the  rally in the stock, and  it was one of the  most mentioned stocks on social media  sites such as Reddit  and Twitch. These investors  relied on social media platforms  to define and coordinate their portfolio strategies, often focused on shorter-term  speculative momentum,  and markets  saw a  rise in  volatility and trading  volumes. This  was magnified  by the  leverage taken  over the  year by individual investors and led to some already expensive stocks becoming even more expensive. We  believe that it  is long-term company  fundamentals such as earnings growth, that  drive returns over time. Overall, markets  finished the year with the MSCI ACWI  returning 19.6% over  2021 in sterling  terms, and  although our portfolio lagged  its benchmark, we remain  confident that it is  very well positioned for strong future returns that, most importantly, are sustainable.

THE PORTFOLIO Our  portfolio has delivered  strong absolute returns,  both over 2021 and since our  appointment in April 2017. However, returns  relative to the MSCI ACWI have been disappointing over both periods. What appeared to be a broadening of market conditions  in the earlier  part of 2021, ended  up being a  continuation of the challenging market conditions we have seen over the last few years, where market leadership has remained very narrow in a handful of very large growth companies. Our  Stock Pickers' focus on the  longer-term fundamentals of the companies they hold  was not sufficiently rewarded by the  market. This was largely a result of the   last   quarter,   where  the  Company's  portfolio  lagged  the  benchmark significantly  after being ahead over the first  three quarters of the year. The 2021 market  environment  was  challenging  for  many active equity managers, as illustrated in the AJ Bell 'Manager versus Machine' report for 2021.(3) Based on that  report, 25% of  active global  equity managers  outperformed their passive alternatives last year. Over  the  full  year,  the  Company's  Total  Shareholder Return was 16.5%. The discount  widened  from  3.5% as  of  the  end of 2020 to 5.3% as of 31 December 2021, consistent  with what was  seen in other  global equity investment trusts. The  Company's Net Asset  Value (NAV) Total  Return was 18.6%, 1% below the MSCI ACWI  return of  19.6%, but was  7.8% above the  MSCI ACWI  Equal-Weighted Index which returned 10.8%. The  Board  set  us  a  high  bar  when  we were appointed in April 2017 with an outperformance  target  of  2% per  annum  after  costs  over rolling three-year periods.  The large-cap skewed, and  challenging, market environment experienced since  2018, has meant that  our focus on  finding the best  companies in a wide global universe, regardless of benchmark biases or company size, has resulted in our  being behind our target. We have a long track record in identifying quality Stock  Pickers.  By  asking  them  to  pick  only their best stock ideas for the Company,  and constructing a risk managed portfolio, we believe we are enhancing our portfolio's alpha potential. We have been managing funds based on our multi- manager,  concentrated approach for many years and have experienced tough market environments  in  the  past.  Despite  temporary  drawbacks,  markets eventually normalise  and long-term  fundamentals come  back into  focus, leading to strong relative  returns  for  our  strategies.  We  therefore  have  conviction in the fundamental  strength of  our portfolio  and believe  it will deliver attractive returns once the narrow leadership of the market dissipates. Since  our appointment, the Company has  delivered a Total Shareholder Return of 64.2% (11.0%  per annum) and a NAV Total  Return of 63.6% (10.9% per annum). If, however,  the  impact  of  the  Company's  now  sold  legacy Non-core Assets and subsidiaries  is  excluded,  the  Company  delivered  a  NAV (Excluding Non-core Assets)  Total Return(1) of 66% (11.3% per annum). All these measures are quoted after  all costs. The  MSCI ACWI returned  69.2% (11.7% per annum)  and the MSCI ACWI  Equal-Weighted Index 38.1% (7.0% per annum) over the same period. The MSCI ACWI  Equal-Weighted Index gives all the stocks  in the MSCI ACWI index an equal weighting rather than, as the MSCI ACWI does, weighting them by company size. As a  result, it is a better indicator of how the average-sized stock performed and reduces the impact of mega-cap growth names that dominated. The  table below, illustrates the performance of the MSCI ACWI index relative to the  MSCI ACWI Equal Weighted Index, on a 12-month rolling basis, along with the performance  of  the  Company's  NAV  (Excluding  Non-core  Assets) Total Return relative  to the MSCI ACWI index on the same bases. The MSCI ACWI Equal Weighted Index,  is an indicator of how the average stock performed rather than the small number  of large-cap companies that dominated the market capitalisation weighted index.  In many  ways, the  equal weighted  index is  more reflective of how our Stock  Pickers think about their portfolios -  focusing on their best ideas from anywhere  and  ignoring  short-term  risks  relative  to the benchmark. From the table,  you can note that the Company's portfolio performs better when a broader set  of stocks share in the market  momentum and underperforms when a few large- cap  stocks dominate. In  2021 the bulk of  our underperformance occurred in the final quarter when the size bias in the market was largest. 1. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-</url> coronavirus-stimulus-check-to-trade-stocks.html 2.

While  the  current  narrowness  of  markets  could clearly continue for a while longer  (it has already  lasted longer than  we anticipated was  likely), we are confident  that at some point there will be  a reversal in this trend, as we saw briefly in the first half of 2021. We believe that this reversal could take hold for  a much longer period. That would  be extremely beneficial for our portfolio and  is one of the reasons we are so excited about it today. In the meantime, we are  comforted that we own a number  of high-quality businesses that are growing faster than the market (have higher earnings per share growth), with more stable earnings  and which are cheaper than the  market (have a lower Price to Earnings ratio).

Notes:  The Price to Earnings ratio, also called the P/E ratio, is an indication of  the worth of a company. It is the amount per share that an investor will pay for each \\xA31 of that company's earnings. One way to calculate the P/E ratio is to use actual reported earnings over the past 12 months. This is referred to as the trailing  P/E ratio. The P/E  ratio can also be  calculated using an estimate of future earnings (the forward P/E). The lower the P/E ratio the better value that company should be. Earnings  per Share is an  indicator of how much  money a company makes for each share  of its stock, it is a  measure of a company's profitability. Earnings per Share  Growth gives a good picture of the  rate at which a company has grown its profitability  over a given period, with  higher levels suggesting a company has products  or services in strong demand and  is able to grow its earnings faster. Earnings  per Share  Stability is  a measure  of the  level of  fluctuation in a company's  Earnings per Share over a given time period, the higher the value the more predictable future earnings should be.

STOCK PERFORMANCE The main reason for our underperformance was that we held more mid and small-cap stocks  and less  large-cap stocks  than the  index. The  table below show that, based  on company size  alone, our size  positioning cost us approximately 3% in performance  terms.  This  was  partially  offset  by good stock selection which improved  performance by  approximately 0.8%. This  negative effect  of the size allocation  impacted our stock selection and  allocation across the regional and sector  level attributions. If we look at  the sectors in which we invested, our overweight  in  Communication  Services,  which  tends  to  have  less large-cap companies  in it and  which did less  well than the  index, detracted some value leading  to a negative sector  allocation effect. Our overweight  is a result of our  Stock Pickers' company selections as opposed  to a macro view on the sector overall.  In addition, stock  selection was negative  as the smaller and mid-cap companies  we held  in each  sector did  less well  than their larger cap peers. Looking at the regions in which we invest we benefited from being underweight in Asia  and the  Emerging Markets,  this benefit  was outweighed  by the choice of stocks  which reduced performance by  2.8%. This negative stock selection impact was  largest  in  the  US,  with  our underweight to US large-caps significantly penalising  the  portfolio.  In  the  following  section we explain this in more detail  and  give  examples  of  the  stock  selections  that  contributed, both negatively and positively, to performance during the year. +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ |                       | Allocation Effect | Selection Effect | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | ATTRIBUTION BY SIZE   | -3.0              | 0.8              | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | ATTRIBUTION BY SECTOR | -0.8              | -1.4             | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | ATTRIBUTION BY REGION | 0.6               | -2.8             | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ Data to 31 December 2021.

Key detractors to performance:   * Certain emerging markets stocks, particularly, Chinese stocks, with our     holdings in Baidu and New Oriental Education alone detracting -0.9%   * In the US, we did not hold Apple and Tesla which detracted -0.7% and some US     stocks that were held such as Charter Communications, Fleetcor Technologies     and Visa, lagged the market   * Some stocks held within the Information Technology and Consumer     Discretionary sectors together with negative allocation impacts from our     slight overweight in Communication Services (one of the worse performing     sectors) also impacted performance With  the  Chinese  government  regulatory  crackdown  and market turmoil around Evergrande, several Chinese stocks detracted value over the year. The  two key  detractors were  Baidu and  New Oriental Education. Baidu, China's internet  search and online community leader, was  held in the portfolio by both River  and Mercantile  Asset Management  and Black  Creek Investment Management. Despite  solid fundamentals, shares  have suffered with  the general sell-off in Chinese  equities, with  the stock  down 30% over  the year.  Nonetheless, these Stock  Pickers  remain  favourable  to  Baidu  and  view  the loss as short-term volatility  within the context of their long-term investment horizon. Baidu is a technology-driven  company and is considered a leader in artificial intelligence (AI)  research, including technology for autonomous vehicles. It is also growing its  cloud  computing  service  offerings  in  China  and  Southeast Asia and is considered  a leader  in AI  cloud services  in China.  With Baidu's only modest direct  exposure  to  the  areas  of  increased  regulation,  its core market of internet  advertising is  competitive and  its areas  of growth,  such as AI and autonomous vehicles, are strongly supported by the Chinese Communist Party, both Stock  Pickers' outlooks for the company are favourable, in particular given its attractive valuation. The  other significant  detractor was  New Oriental  Education, the Chinese for- profit  education  business,  a  company  that  was  held  by Sustainable Growth Advisers  (SGA). SGA had  owned New Oriental  Education for a  long time. It had generated  significant value  for investors  as its  share price multiplied. SGA sold  down the  company's shares  in February  2020 at a significant profit from their  original acquisition  cost. More  recently, regulation  in the sector has been  expected and SGA's  view was that  ultimately regulation would benefit the strongest players as they would be best able to navigate the regulations, absorb the cost and gain market share. SGA bought shares in the company after the share price  fell  approximately  50% from  its  peak  but,  as  it  became  clear the regulatory clampdown was going to materially change the profitability allowed in the  sector, SGA quickly exited  the position, at a  loss. Despite being a major negative contributor to performance over the year, SGA's holding in New Oriental added value since April 2017. The next biggest detractor to performance was not holding Apple which rallied by more  than 35% over the year. Not  holding Tesla also hurt relative performance, with  the stock  up 51% over  the year.  Last year,  many active growth managers underperformed(1),  being underweight both stocks. Tesla  is valued at more than all  other key auto manufacturers in  the world combined, despite accounting for just  over 1% of global car sales. Over 2021, the company's market cap increased by  over half a trillion dollars, essentially the equivalent of a new JP Morgan, or  a Procter &amp; Gamble, whereas Apple added approximately the same amount to its market capitalisation in just 6 weeks from mid-November 2021. 1. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1f96d83-1a72-47d7-a4af-2483bd49b024\">https://www.ft.com/content/d1f96d83-1a72-47d7-a4af-2483bd49b024</url> Key contributors to performance:   * Stock selection within the Communication Services sector was positive. Our     holding in Alphabet and Interpublic Group of Companies added value, as did     being underweight Tencent and Verizon Communications Inc.   * Stock selection within the Health Care sector with a number of our holdings     performing strongly such as CVS Health Corporation, UnitedHealth Group and     Novo Nordisk   * Our underweight in Emerging Markets, which was the worst performing region     over the period Internet  search leader Alphabet Inc. was the largest contributor to performance during  the year, up  66%. Alphabet's reported revenues  grew significantly over the  year,  largely  on  the  back  of  strong  growth  in advertising revenues, including  solid  growth  in  YouTube  revenues.  Google Cloud, another business segment of the tech giant, also delivered solid results despite still being loss making. The  company is held across five Stock  Pickers as at the 31 December 2021, with many  impressed by the company's execution  and growth potential while remaining cognisant of valuation and rising regulatory risks. The  second largest contributor to  performance was Nvidia Corporation (Nvidia), up  an impressive 127% over  the year. Nvidia  designs graphics processing units (GPUs)  for the gaming and  professional markets, as well  as 'system on a chip' (SoC)  units  for  the  mobile  computing  and automotive market. The company is benefitting from a sustained increase in demand for its products, driven in part by  gaming consoles that use  Nvidia's GPUs (which constitute  more than half of its  revenue) and in  part by cryptocurrency  infrastructure. Evergrowing demand for  the company's  cloud storage  has also  fuelled robust spending by Nvidia's largest  customers  and  has  been  a  source  of  high margin revenue strength. Continued  growth  in  the  firm's  large  gaming  sector business and a growing automotive  pipeline  are  other  key  factors  in  the positive outlook for the company.  Nvidia was held in the portfolio by both GQG Partners and Vulcan Value Partners over 2021. KKR  &amp; Co.  Inc., an  American global  investment company  held by  Vulcan Value Partners,  was the third largest contributor to performance for the year. KKR is a global investment firm that manages multiple alternative asset classes. It has stable  capital  with  a  stable  client  base and predictable earnings. KKR has enjoyed  the  favourable  tailwind  of  increasing  allocations  by investors to private and alternative investments. STOCK PICKER PERFORMANCE In  the 12 months to  31 December 2021, only three  out of our  ten global Stock Pickers outperformed the benchmark index. GQG Partners' emerging markets mandate which has a lower exposure to China outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets Index over the year. The cyclical rotation at the beginning of the year allowed our value-based Stock Pickers  to  recover  some  of  the  previous  years' losses, with Lyrical Asset Management  (Lyrical) posting  the strongest  returns in  the first  half of the year.  In contrast,  the portfolio's  large-cap, growth-oriented  Stock Pickers, such  as Sustainable Growth Advisers (SGA),  were amongst the poorer performers. As   concerns  over  inflation  diminished  somewhat  mid-year,  growth-oriented managers  recovered ground and the recovery in value-oriented managers' momentum faltered,  until December, when  value rebounded again.  In the 12-month period, which  saw  fluctuations  in  terms  of  style  and size dominance, Vulcan Value Partners  and  Lyrical  were  the  best  performing  managers,  with  River  and Mercantile  Asset  Management,  the  deep-value  recovery  manager,  the biggest underperformer. The  volatility and rotation  in markets this  year illustrate the importance of maintaining  a  mixture  of  different  Stock Pickers whose different investment styles  allow the  portfolio to  gain upside  in different  market scenarios and deliver smoother returns. OUTLOOK Despite  disappointing relative  returns in  the fourth  quarter of 2021, we are very  excited by the current portfolio's  fundamentals and how these are helping to  position the portfolio for 2022. As of  the end of 2021, the portfolio looks better  value than the benchmark, with stronger and more stable earnings growth. Although  long-term fundamentals were  less of a  focus in 2021, we believe they will  come back into the  limelight, as they are  the driver of long-term equity returns. Some  of our stocks have  been hurt on a  relative basis by the sentiment-driven market,  being overly penalised by short-term considerations despite maintaining very  strong long-term credentials. Our Stock Pickers stand by these firms. They include  names such as  Booking.com, other consumer  discretionary names such as Adidas,  or payments companies such as  MasterCard or Visa. These companies were all  hit  by  the  Omicron  variant-related  uncertainty  as  well as occasional idiosyncratic  concerns. Despite the short-term  impacts of the Omicron variant, companies  such as Booking.com, with  dominant market positions, should flourish over the long term. With the threat of persistent inflation now present, those growth companies with particularly  lofty valuations are  most vulnerable to  the associated impact of tightening  financial conditions, particularly once Omicron fears recede, and as longer-term  fundamentals come back into focus.  We have already seen volatility in the early part of 2022 as markets weigh up the impact of rising inflation and increasing costs of capital. We believe the overall growth rate of corporate profits is set to slow in 2022, relative  to  the  recovery  levels  of  growth  seen in 2021, returning to pre- pandemic  trend growth perhaps as early as the end of 2022. While the outcome is uncertain,  we expect  inflation rates  to slow  as commodity  prices stabilise, workers  continue to  return to  the workforce  after Covid pressures abate; and some  of the global supply constraints currently disrupting industry continue to ease. However,  there are risks to the upside  in terms of inflation trends and equity market  returns.  The  increased  geopolitical  tensions surrounding Ukraine and Russia's recent actions are further fuelling volatility and compounding concerns around  inflationary impacts  on energy  prices associated  with this escalating conflict. We could also see elevated price pressures persisting for longer given continued  risks of supply-side constraints and  the impact of very tight labour markets.  As such,  a fundamental  bottom-up analysis  of the resiliency of each company  to inflationary pressures is  required. Valuations continue to compress driven by rising discount rates and continued recovery in earnings for Covid-hit sectors.  We  expect  margins  to  be  the  deciding  factor  for equity returns (particularly  in the  US where  the economy  is further  along in  the business cycle).  Companies best able  to pass on  (or avoid) rising  input prices whilst navigating  the impact of rising yields across many developed markets may be set to  navigate  this  environment  well.  Our  Stock  Pickers  have  been actively evaluating the impacts of higher inflation on their companies to ensure they can weather that storm. Regarding  China, recent regulatory changes  have dominated 2021 for the region. Navigating  these changes may be  the main challenge for  investors in the short term  against a global backdrop  of rising inflation in  the West and prevailing US-China  tensions.  Overall,  whilst  uncertainty  does  cloud  the  region, we continue  to believe  the long-term  case for  Chinese equities  remains and the region  provides  selective  investment  opportunities,  potentially  broadening sources of diversity available to investors. As  current  global  constraints  start  to  ease, and concerns over the Omicron variant  continue to dissipate, we believe we  will see a continuation of market recovery, providing great opportunities. PORTFOLIO CASE STUDY: CLOUD COMPUTING Demand  for  cloud  computing  is  growing  rapidly  driven  by  the  constantly increasing amount of global data produced, and the need for complex and flexible computation.  Cloud solutions are also  offering enhanced employee flexibility - which is critically important due to the increasing permanence of remote working and  adaptability companies  will need  in the  future. Covid-19 has accelerated these  trends. Cloud has also  helped transform software by  allowing for a more subscription  and consumption-based  business model,  enabling more frequent and seamless  software updates, significantly improving customer profitability, ease of use and functionality. We  hold  several  stocks  that  benefit  both  directly and indirectly from the migration  of businesses  toward greater  cloud computing.  From the  well known mega-caps  such as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft or  Baidu, to other names such as Oracle,  Dell, Western Digital, ServiceNow, Twilio, Autodesk and salesforce.com, these are just a few of the stocks held that benefit from cloud computing. Ultimately,  cloud computing  companies are  seeing more  recurring revenues via longer-term   relationships  with  businesses  which  has  been  the  source  of attractive  growth for  the segment.  While the  growth opportunity  is massive, selectivity will be increasingly critical. PORTFOLIO CASE STUDY: SEMICONDUCTORS Semiconductors  are  an  essential  component  of  electronic  devices, enabling advances   in   communications,   computing,   healthcare,   military   systems, transportation, clean energy and countless other applications. Due to their role in  the  fabrication  of  electronic  devices,  semiconductors are a high growth segment  of the market which will  benefit from increasing digitalisation of the economy.  One of our Stock Pickers expects annualised industry revenue growth to accelerate from 5% over the past decade to more than 10% over the next 10 years. Historically,  the semiconductor industry has been largely driven by devices per human.  In the future,  it is likely  the industry will  benefit from trends not limited  by human use (The Internet-of-Things), and new technologies that demand greater  processing power than traditional  smartphone devices (e.g. virtual and augmented reality). We   hold  many  semiconductor  companies,  including  Nvidia,  Qorvo,  Skyworks Solutions,   ASML  Holdings,  Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  and Broadcom,  to name but a  few. Current demand for  semiconductor chips is vastly outstripping supply, impacting production across a number of industries from car manufacturers  to  consumer  appliance  producers  -  a  trend that is likely to continue  into  2022. The  semiconductor  industry  is also benefitting from the transition  to  a  world  aligned  with  a  2\\xB0C climate  target,  being critical components  in electric vehicles (EVs) and other  products that form part of the climate solution. The concentrated market, coupled with demand outstripping supply, has caused our Stock Pickers to focus on the best-in-class companies in the semiconductor space where  they  see  the  highest  likelihood  of sustainable earnings growth going forward. PORTFOLIO CASE STUDY: CLIMATE SOLUTIONS Climate  change is one of the biggest  issues facing investors today and both we and  our Stock Pickers, are actively looking at climate-related risks within the portfolio.  But the climate transition also offers opportunities by investing in those companies that are providing solutions to others in this space. The  portfolio includes a number  of companies that are  working on solutions to help  the  economy  reduce  climate-related  risks,  including  Bureau  Veritas, Schneider Electric, Owens Corning, ANDRITZ and many more. Bureau  Veritas  is  a  global  leader  in  the  provision  of carbon and energy consultancy,  verification  and  certification  services.  Their team of experts support  the development of  bespoke energy and  carbon management strategies to set  objectives,  targets  and  management  plans,  helping  companies  in their decarbonisation journey. Schneider  Electric SE  is a  French multinational  company providing energy and automation  digital solutions  for efficiency  and sustainability.  It addresses homes,  buildings,  data  centres,  infrastructure  and industries, by combining energy  technologies, real-time automation, software and services. It was ranked the  world's  most  sustainable  corporation  by  Corporate Knights in 2021.(1) Schneider  Electric helps customers reduce  their carbon footprints via products and software tools that optimise energy management and industrial processes. Owens  Corning  is  a  global  building  and  industrial  materials  leader. The company's  three  integrated  businesses  are  dedicated  to the manufacture and advancement  of a  broad range  of insulation,  roofing and fibreglass composite materials.  Owens Corning provides innovative products and sustainable solutions that  address  energy  efficiency,  product  safety,  renewable  energy, durable infrastructure and labour productivity. ANDRITZ   is  an  international  technology  group  providing  plants,  systems, equipment  and  services  for  various  industries.  ANDRITZ  Hydro  is a global supplier  of electromechanical  systems and  services ('from water-to-wire') for hydropower plants and one of the leaders in the world market for hydraulic power generation. ANDRITZ offers technologies for producing steam and electricity from renewable fuels as well as the efficient use of traditional fossil fuels. In  addition to  the above  stocks, we  also hold  a number of energy companies. Although  their carbon footprint  might be significant  now, we believe they are also  part of  the solution,  not only  because they  have plans  to align their carbon   reduction  trajectory  with  the  Paris  Agreement,  but  also  through researching  and  investing  in  alternative  energy  sources and carbon capture technology.  Our Stock  Pickers incorporate  an ESG  lens in their evaluation of these  companies and  also, along  with EOS  at Federated Hermes (EOS), actively engage  with  them  to  steer  them  towards better practices, reinforcing their engagement via voting activity. We provide a BP engagement case study by EOS via the Climate Action 100+ initiative in our Responsible Investment section on page 25 of the Annual Report. 1.

Stock  selection  remains  the  key  driver  of performance and of the portfolio's  risk  profile.  The  portfolio  maintained  a  regional  and sector allocation approximately in line with that of the benchmark as a result. By  far the  largest country  weighting is  to the  US, which saw strong returns throughout   2021. At  57.6% of  the  portfolio  as  at  31 December  2021, this represents  a slight  underweight to  the benchmark  weight which was 61.2%. The portfolio  had  an  allocation  to  the  UK  of 10.5% as at 31 December 2021, an overweight  of 6.9% versus  the MSCI  ACWI, and  our biggest regional overweight position.  Most UK  investments are  opportunities selected  by our  value Stock Pickers and, whilst many of these companies are based in the UK, they tend to be global in nature. The best performing sector over the period was Energy, up 38% for the year, with our allocation of 3.4% within the portfolio being in line with the index weight. The  sector was boosted  by soaring energy  prices throughout the year. Consumer Discretionary  was the worst  performing sector over  the year and the portfolio was slightly underweight, with a position of 10.8% as of 31 December 2021 versus a weight of 12.4% in the MSCI ACWI.

INVESTMENT RISK AND POSITIONING The Company has both long-term and short-term borrowing facilities to provide it with  flexibility to  manage gearing.  In 2021, we  maintained a  gross level of gearing  of  between  9.2% and  10.2%, reflecting  our  positive  view of equity markets.  Given the strong equity returns  in 2021, gearing added value over the period. In December we recommended the Company increase its short-term borrowing facility by up to \\xA3100m. At 31 December 2021 the Company has unsecured long-term loans  amounting to \\xA3160.0m.  In addition the  Company had drawn  \\xA3180.5m of its approved  borrowing facilities of \\xA3250.0m plus  an accordion option of a further \\xA350.0m. Portfolio  turnover was 65.7% for  the 12 months to  December 2021. The level of turnover  was  higher  than  might  otherwise  be  expected,  in part due to the addition of Sands Capital Management and Metropolis Capital as Stock Pickers and the termination of Lomas Capital Management's mandate during the year. Annualised expected volatility was 19% p.a. for the portfolio and 18.3% p.a. for the benchmark as at 31 December 2021. Active Share, the measure of how different the portfolio is to the benchmark, was 75%, with Active Risk (or tracking error) at  2.7% p.a.  as  at  31 December  2021. We  have  retained  a broadly balanced exposure  to styles, sectors,  and geographical regions  in 2021 relative to the benchmark.  This is in line with our  process and has been an appropriate method to  manage risk, as performance of  the different investment styles, markets and sectors  differed significantly,  in another  particularly volatile year. During 2021, we did not implement any currency hedging for the portfolio. Our reference benchmark  is unhedged, and  our currency exposure  is in line  with our country allocations.  As part  of our  portfolio risk  management, we monitor and manage country  and currency  exposure, aiming  not to  diverge significantly  from the benchmark  allocations.  However,  we  can  hedge  currency  risk  as  required, depending on our view of the risk profile.

We monitor and  continuously review  the performance  of each  Stock Picker. Changes can be made  at any time if we believe there is the potential to improve expected risk- adjusted  returns.  Changes  in  our  views  on  the Stock Pickers are driven by factors  that impact on  their sustainability of  competitive advantage, such as changes  to  key  personnel  or  company  culture  and  to corporate activity or investment  style drift. The Company will  usually announce any changes of Stock Pickers  once  the  transition  of  assets  to  the  new  appointee(s)  has been completed.

'JUPITER'  and the Jupiter  logo are the trade  marks of Jupiter  Investment Management Group  Ltd. 2. Appointed 16 April 2021. Lomas Capital Management was a Stock Picker until 3 February 2021. HOW WE MANAGE THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO We have overall responsibility for the management of the Company's portfolio. We have  built and manage a team of  diverse, best-in-class* Stock Pickers, each of whom  invest in  a bespoke  selection of  typically 10-20 of their 'best ideas'. 'Investing For Generations' is the backbone of the philosophy of the Company. It brings  long-term  principles  into  how  we  invest  your  money, including ESG considerations.  This helps us define our investment approach, ensuring that the Stock  Pickers' thinking and practices are aligned  with the core beliefs of the Company  and that  they invest  responsibly. We  consider this  a key factor for long-term success. HOW WE CHOOSE OUR STOCK PICKERS We  aim to forge abiding  partnerships with our Stock  Pickers, enabling them to focus  on what they do best. Our Stock  Pickers are focused on the long term and do  not necessarily look  at volatility as  a risk, but  more as an opportunity: risk is more associated with the permanent loss of capital. After  a number of  years where no  significant manager changes  were made, this year  saw a number  of changes. Following  the termination of  Lomas' mandate in February, due to the surprise decision of the firm to wind down its business, we appointed  two  new  Stock  Pickers:  Sands  Capital Management, LLC (Sands) and Metropolis Capital Limited (Metropolis). Sands is a growth manager. It seeks out opportunities  in businesses offering sustainable, above-average earnings growth with  leadership positions and significant  competitive advantages, clear value- add  and  financial  strength.  Metropolis  adopts  a  value-based  approach  to investing. It looks to identify mispriced opportunities across a broad universe. This  ranges from  high-quality companies  in industries  with poor economics or out-of-favour  sectors, to  ones where  its assessment  of growth differs to the market  or  where  growth  investors  are  selling  due  to  decelerating growth momentum. We invest significant time, research and effort in identifying Stock Pickers for the  Company's  portfolio,  leveraging  our  extensive  research network, robust process  and  expertise.  Our  approach  involves  identifying  the  skills  and characteristics  we believe are essential in  good Stock Pickers. We believe the key  to identifying tomorrow's  high-performing Stock Pickers  lies in extensive due  diligence  combined  with  qualitative  and quantitative analysis. This due diligence focuses on:   * the investment processes, resources and decision-making that make up the     Stock Picker's competitive advantage;   * the culture and alignment of the organisation that leads to sustainability     of that competitive advantage;   * their approach to responsible investment. We expect our Stock Pickers to     have a demonstrable process in place that identifies and assesses material     ESG factors; we aim to appoint Stock Pickers who actively engage with the     companies in which they invest and have an effective voting policy. When     necessary, we engage with the Stock Pickers and guide them towards better     practices; and   * the operational infrastructure that minimises risk from a compliance,     regulatory and operational perspective. We  do not  believe that  quantitative assessments  on their  own provide enough information to give us an advantage in assessing the potential of a Stock Picker to  outperform. Our Manager Research team formulates a view on each Stock Picker we  seek to  rate over  a series  of meetings.  We look  beyond past performance numbers  to try to understand what 'competitive  edge' each Stock Picker has and whether  that edge is likely to be sustainable in the future. We dig deeper into the  investments made  by each  Stock Picker  using a  case study methodology to understand  the depth of fundamental  analysis involved in investment decisions. We look at matters such as the team's process for selecting stocks, adherence to this  process  through  different  market  conditions,  relevant  team dynamics, training  and experience as well  as performance track record.  We see the track record  as just a single  data point and, without  the context of the additional data  we assess, it is  unlikely to persuade us  that a Stock Picker is skilled. Our  expectation of success further rises where  we engage with Stock Pickers to structure  bespoke high conviction, concentrated strategies usually of 10 to 20 stocks,  at an attractive cost and we believe portfolios are more robust when we diversify  across Stock Pickers with differing approaches. High active share and concentrated  portfolios are  advantageous. Academic  research supports this(.1) The  broadest opportunity  set is  provided by  unrestricted global mandates, to allow skilled Stock Pickers the widest scope. 1.

RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OUR APPROACH TO RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT A  core part of our  manager research, selection and  monitoring procedure is an assessment  of ESG risks and opportunities. We require our Stock Pickers to have a  demonstrable  process  in  place  that  identifies  and assesses material ESG factors.  We expect our Stock Pickers to act where they determine an ESG risk is likely  to affect the performance  of an investee company  and that this risk is outweighing  any potential financial  reward. Although we  consider the 'E', 'S' and 'G' factors within our approach, in our report for this year we have focused more on the 'E' component and, in particular, climate risk. E IS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT Whilst climate-related risk is first and foremost a physical environmental risk, it  is also a  financial risk. It  is one of  the key areas  that we require our Stock Pickers to identify and assess when they select stocks for the portfolio. In  2021, both we and the Board recognised the impact that climate-related risks could  have,  and  made  a  commitment  to  a  target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions  from the portfolio by 2050 and, on the way, to halve them by 2030. In addition to playing a part in the necessary transition to a low-carbon world, we believe  that this will be beneficial to  the expected returns of the portfolio, ensuring  we reduce the transition risks in the portfolio and investing ahead of other investors moving in this direction. This  means that, by the  middle of the century,  the amount of greenhouse gases across  the  portfolio  must  overall  net  off  to  zero, taking account of the emissions  arising from the  day-to-day operations of  the companies held in the portfolio. This  target is consistent with  the goals of the  Paris Agreement and meets the principles  of the Institutional Investors Group  on Climate Change (IIGCC), Net Zero  Investing Framework (NZIF)(1)  and the Net  Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI)  of which  we are  signatories. We  have always  recognised the power of collaboration and that it is particularly important in the area of ESG. WTW is a signatory   to  the  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment  and  the  2020 UK Stewardship  Code,  signalling  the  robustness  of our approach to stewardship, including our partnership with EOS, a stewardship specialist, which provides our Stock   Pickers   with   voting  recommendations  and  engages  with  companies, legislators, regulators, and industry bodies on our and the Company's behalf. Climate  risk is a key consideration and  engagement priority for EOS as well as our Stock Pickers. EOS and a number of our Stock Pickers are involved in Climate Action  100+, a  collaborative  engagement  initiative  which aims to ensure the world's  largest  corporate  greenhouse  gas  emitters  take necessary action on climate change. We illustrate a case study of their engagement with BP below. TARGET NET ZERO: OUR CARBON JOURNEY PLAN Plotting the net zero journey, is a developing science; identifying what data we should  collect and how best  to measure and analyse  it is part of our evolving Carbon  Journey Plan  methodology. This  will include  a rigorous framework with which to measure and evaluate our progress, along with controls to help keep the portfolio on track. Our  aim is  to align  our Carbon  Journey Plan  to limiting  global temperature increases well below 2\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. We have also set a mid-way milestone  where, by 2030, we plan to have achieved a 50% reduction in portfolio emissions relative to 2019. This provides the Company with a strategic framework to  manage and monitor the reduction in  carbon exposure over time. Our triggers and intermediate targets will be developed and shared as we report, in the years to come, on our progress on this journey. 1. The Net Zero Investment Framework, published in March 2021, provides a common set  of recommended actions,  metrics and methodologies  through which investors can maximise their contribution to achieving global net zero global emissions by 2050 or sooner. EOS CASE STUDY: BP plc Climate Action 100+ In  the 2019 Annual Report  we described EOS  and Climate Action 100+ engagement with  BP which culminated  with the 2019 shareholder  resolution calling for the company  to set out a business strategy that is consistent with the goals of the Paris  Agreement on climate change. The resolution gained management support and was  co-filed by nearly 10% of  the shareholder base, passing  with a very large majority at the shareholder meeting in 2019. In early 2020, the newly-appointed CEO, Bernard Looney, announced a new ambition for  the company to transition  to net zero by  2050 or sooner, supported by 10 underpinning  corporate aims. The company has since laid out a detailed strategy by which it intends to transition the energy it produces from high carbon to low carbon, including short, medium and long-term targets and aims on the journey to net  zero. The company also has  market-leading disclosures demonstrating how it evaluates  new  material  capex  investments  for  consistency  with  the  Paris Agreement goals. EOS  further intervened at  the 2020 shareholder meeting,  asking the company to reconsider  its assumptions  for Paris-consistent  investment and  its long-term oil-and-gas  price assumptions in light of  the coronavirus pandemic. During its Q2  2021 results, BP reduced the long-term oil-and-gas price assumptions used in its  financial  statements,  giving  shareholders  greater  visibility about the firm's climate-related risks. EOS  continue  to  engage  with  BP  to  seek  assurances that it has in place a rigorous   investment  process,  with  economic  criteria  consistent  with  the company's   purpose  and  a  range  of  price  scenarios  including  assumptions consistent  with the Paris goals.  They are also requesting  that BP extends its net  zero goal beyond  the energy produced  by the company  to apply also to the energy products it markets and sells to customers.

APPROACH: LOOK FORWARD AND AVOID OVERSIMPLIFICATION Divestment from carbon intensive industries can often be self-defeating. We want to  encourage corporates,  industries and  countries to  move towards low-carbon solutions.  Starving  them  of  investment  can potentially discourage them from making  a  positive  change.  Many  climate  solutions  are  being  developed by companies  that are currently  highly carbon intensive  but which will provide a path for the whole economy to decarbonise more quickly. It  might not always be in the Company's shareholders' financial interests to be ahead  of the pathway  to net zero.  This year, some  of our Stock Pickers found attractive  opportunities in  the Energy  sector, leading  to an increase in the portfolio's  carbon  footprint.  These  stocks  contributed  positively  to  the portfolio, as energy prices sky-rocketed, driven by supply chain issues. Many of these  companies are, however, on a decarbonisation path that is consistent with the Paris Agreement, something that we and our Stock Pickers monitor. Often they are heavy investors in green energy and will be a key part of the solution. This  approach means that  we place greater  importance on effective stewardship and,  more  specifically,  voting  and  engagement  as  a  means  to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. We  provide an illustration of the  carbon emissions and Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI) of the current holdings in the portfolio and the index, as well as  the trend  in the  emissions and  WACI of  these stocks through time. Carbon emissions for the portfolio is higher than for the benchmark, due to some of our Stock Pickers having increased  their allocation to  energy stocks earlier  in the year. Our exposure will depend on opportunities that arise and, at any given point in time, we will not necessarily always be ahead of the pathway to net zero. The weighted average carbon  intensity,  a  measure  of  a  portfolio's  exposure  to  carbon-related potential  market and  regulatory risks,  is however  lower than  the benchmark. Critically, in terms of both measures, the carbon emissions of the stocks in the portfolio are reducing at a faster rate than the stocks in the benchmark.

ENGAGEMENT EOS engaged with 128 companies on 571 issues and objectives There  are numerous 'layers' of engagement within the Company's portfolio. These include  our  engagement  with  the  Stock  Pickers  in order to assess how well climate-related  issues, as  well as  wider sustainability  issues, are factored into  their  investment  process  and  stewardship  activities  and when needed, steering them towards better practices. We also engage with the asset management industry  at large regarding sustainability  and stewardship practices, and with industry  bodies, governments, regulators, and  policy makers, both individually and via several collaborative initiatives. In  addition, we partner  with EOS, who  engages with companies, regulators, and governments on our and the Company's behalf. Our Stock Pickers and EOS regularly engage with companies to ensure they improve disclosure and change behaviours to enhance  their climate resilience. This  includes collaborative initiatives such as  Climate Action 100+. Over the course of 2021, EOS engaged with 128 companies held  within  the  Company's  portfolio  on  571 issues and objectives. Of these engagements  within the environmental category, which accounted for 25% of total engagement, 74% of environmental engagements related to climate change. MANDATE CHANGES We excluded companies with significant exposure to tar sands and thermal coal Exclusion can be warranted in situations where, for example, exposure to climate risk  cannot be resolved via  other means such as  engagement. Where a company's business  relies heavily on activities  that are likely to  be phased out in the 'net  zero world',  engagement is  unlikely to  be fruitful.  In 2021, the Board decided  to exclude companies with significant revenue exposure to tar sands and thermal coal from the portfolio. CLIMATE SOLUTIONS Our  Stock Pickers will  hold companies trying  to develop more energy efficient alternatives and new technology solutions Finally,  we should note that climate change also presents attractive investment opportunities  for our Stock Pickers. Many  companies are involved in addressing climate  resilience and our Stock  Pickers actively invest in  a number of them. This  includes  companies  in  some  traditionally  'dirty'  sectors, working on developing  more  energy  efficient  alternatives,  as  well  as  new innovative companies offering new technology and/or solutions. S IS FOR SOCIAL Whilst  this year we report more on climate risk, we do not forget other factors that  appear  closer  to  home.  Social  and  ethical topics regularly represent approximately a quarter of EOS's engagement activity. During the last couple of years, EOS has recognised how the pandemic has put key workers in supermarkets, retail pharmacies, logistics and the caring professions under acute pressure - but the ongoing pandemic has also demonstrated their true value  to society more clearly  than ever. As a  result, EOS has engaged closely with  companies on how they have treated their employees, given their importance to overall business performance. In  their engagements with  companies, EOS recognised  that companies in certain sectors faced unenviable choices - between making workers redundant or going out of  business, for example.  Hospitality, travel and  high street retail were all badly  hit, triggering thousands of job losses.  EOS wrote an open letter to the CEOs  of the companies in its engagement  programme, asking how they were making difficult decisions in relation to their employees, supply chains, customers and other stakeholders. Companies that made workers redundant after benefitting from taxpayer-funded  bailouts or  furlough schemes  have attracted public criticism, particularly if they had spent the pre-crisis years using surplus cash for share buybacks.  EOS has  encouraged a  responsible approach  to the use of government furlough schemes, and fairness between executive and staff pay. In addition to the engagement activity undertaken by EOS, our Stock Pickers also engage  on social issues  with their companies.  SGA, for instance, engaged with Walt Disney on the topic of modern slavery risk within the supply chain of their licensed merchandised goods. MANAGER ENGAGEMENT CASE STUDY: SGA ENGAGEMENT WITH WALT DISNEY Walt  Disney is one of  the world's largest licensors  with brands spanning Walt Disney  Studios, DisneyPixar, Marvel,  ESPN and more.  Given the company's broad exposure  to  its  suppliers,  Disney  takes  a  risk-based approach to auditing suppliers  with the vast majority of audits  conducted by third parties in high- risk  areas. If corrective issues are identified, suppliers are given one chance to  remedy the  issue before  termination of  the relationship. Audits currently prioritise  the health  and safety  of the  manufacturing environment  and while forced  labour is an area  of audit, it is  not currently a significant feature. Disclosures  into Walt  Disney's supply  chain are  limited and  the company has opportunities  to increase transparency, particularly into its suppliers further down  the chain. SGA encouraged management to take action and publicly map these supply  chains; they  will continue  to monitor  the company's progress in these areas of risk. Source: Sustainable Growth Advisers. G IS FOR GOVERNANCE Good governance gets great results Stock  Pickers  are  expected  to  promote  good  governance by exercising their investor  rights  and  by  engaging  with  companies on issues of governance and shareholder value and in the long-term interest of the Company's shareholders. It  is  no  surprise  that  the  majority  of  voting activity and a significant proportion  of engagement activity therefore  continues to relate to Governance- related issues. This can be on a number of issues such as Board Diversity, Board Independence,   Executive   Remuneration,   Shareholder  Rights  and  Succession Planning. Voting: Stock Pickers voted on 3,290 resolutions In  addition to  engagement, EOS  provides voting  recommendations to  our Stock Pickers, who exercise the voting rights in respect of the stocks they hold. Over the  course of 2021 the  Stock Pickers voted  on all voteable proposals, casting votes  on 3,290 resolutions  at company  meetings. Of  these, they voted against company  management on 323 and abstained from voting on 59. Of the votes against management,  the  key  issues  voted  on  were governance-related issues such as remuneration  and Directors-related  topics. Voting  against management,  and in particular, against the re-election of certain Directors or on specific climate- related  resolutions, allows  the Stock  Pickers to  communicate dissatisfaction following a lack of progress achieved via engagement.

Source: EOS at Federated Hermes, data to 31 December 2021 DIVIDEND AN INCREASED DIVIDEND The  Company has significantly increased its  total dividend for 2021, up 32.5% from 14.38p in 2020 to 19.05p in 2021. This was achieved by increasing the third and  fourth interim dividends for 2021 by 62.0% from  that paid at the same time last  year. Had we increased the first  and second interim dividends to the same level this would have resulted in an annual dividend yield of 2.3%.(1) The  increase in  the Company's  dividend was  implemented by  the Board after a review  of the level  and funding of  the dividend which  included obtaining and listening  to the views  of shareholders. The  Board believes that the increased level  of dividend is both  sustainable and affordable and  it expects to extend the Company's 55-year track record of annual dividend increases for many years. The  Company's Dividend Policy  and its investment  objective (see page 2 of the Annual Report) and investment strategy remain unchanged. The  aim is to continue delivering a rising  dividend year after year as well as capital growth. 1. This is based on the Company's share price at 31 December 2021. DIVIDEND POLICY Subject  to market conditions and  the Company's performance, financial position and  outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The  Company expects to  pay four interim  dividends per year,  on or around the last  day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. In  determining the level of future dividends,  the Board will take into account factors  such  as  any  anticipated  increase  or  decrease  in  dividend cover, projected income, inflation and yield on similar investment trusts. The  Board will  continue to  take advantage  of the  Company's structure  as an investment  trust and  will use  both its  investment income and its significant accumulated distributable reserves to fund dividend payments. The Company policy of paying quarterly interim dividends means that shareholders have  certainty of the  date on which  they will receive  their income but means they   are  not  asked  to  approve  the  final  dividend.  However,  each  year shareholders  are given  the opportunity  to share  their views on the Company's dividend by being asked to approve the Company's Dividend Policy. DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES The  Company's distributable reserves at  31 December 2021, including the merger reserve  which was  converted into  a distributable  reserve in  July 2021, were \\xA33.3bn (2020: \\xA32.3bn). Of these, the Company's revenue reserve was \\xA395.2m (2020: \\xA399.2),  realised  capital  reserves  were  \\xA32.8bn (2020: \\xA31.9bn) and unrealised capital  reserves  were  \\xA30.5bn  (2020:  \\xA30.4bn).  Both  elements of the capital reserves  are readily convertible  to cash. The  Board expects to utilise \\xA310.5m (2020:  \\xA310.1m) to support the total  dividend declared for 2021. Details of the Company's reserves can be found on page 90 of the Annual Report. DIVIDEND DECLARATION The  Ordinary  Dividend  for  2021 will  increase  by 32.5% to 19.054p. A fourth interim dividend of 5.825p will be paid on 31 March 2022 to shareholders who are on  the register on 11 March 2022. The payment dates for the 2022 financial year can be found on page 119 of the Annual Report. INCOME &amp; COSTS INCOME The Company's income from dividends in 2021 saw a significant increase to \\xA361.9m from \\xA345.6m, also above the \\xA358.7m received in 2019. COSTS The  Company's  Ongoing  Charges  Ratio  (OCR)  was  0.60% (2020:  0.64%). Total administrative expenses were \\xA35.9m (2020: \\xA36.0m). Investment management expenses were  \\xA314.1m (2020: \\xA312.0m).  The Company incurred  property and other costs not connected  with the ongoing investment  business of the Company  for the year of \\xA30.5m  (2020: \\xA30.4m). The main  contributor to the lower  OCR was an increase in the  average daily  NAVs. This  meant that  the Company's  fixed costs  became a smaller proportion of its expenses. The  Board has  a policy  of adopting  a one-quarter  revenue and three-quarters capital  allocation  for  management  fees,  financing  costs and other indirect expenses  where this is consistent with  the Association of Investment Companies (AIC)  Statement  of  Recommended  Practice:  Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts. The  Company's costs  remain competitive  for an  actively managed multi-manager global equity fund. DISCOUNT &amp; SHARE BUYBACKS   * A stable discount   * 4.2% of our share capital bought back in 2021 DISCOUNT AND SHARE BUYBACKS The  discount remained stable for  most of the year  except for one day in March 2021 when  it rose  to 9.3% before  returning to  the range  of between 7.0% and 4.5% that it occupied for most of the year. The discount at 31 December 2021 was 5.3% (2020:  3.5%) and  the  average  for  the  year  was 5.9% (2020: 5.6%). The widening of the discount is consistent with what was seen in other global equity investment trusts. The  Company  bought  back  4.2% of  its  issued  share capital during the year, purchasing  13,480,500 shares  and  adding  \\xA38.0m  to  the  Net  Asset Value for remaining  shareholders. The total  cost of the  share buybacks was \\xA3131.0m. The weighted  average discount of shares  bought back in the  year was 6.1%. All the shares bought back were cancelled. Share  buybacks,  combined  with  the  effect  of  the  change  in the discount, contributed a total of 0.3% to the Company's performance in the year. The  table below the high level of discount that persisted in the years prior to the adoption of the current investment strategy in 2017 and the stability of the average  discount since.  It also  shows that  the cost  of share buybacks since 2017 to  maintain a stable discount  have been roughly equal  to the cost in the years  immediately prior to  that date. The  Board will continue  to monitor the stability of the discount and will take advantage of any significant widening of the discount to produce additional return for shareholders.

The Court Order became effective on 9 July 2021 completing the process such that the  former Merger reserve is now distributable.

Total   Company   expenses  of  \\xA320,049k  (\\xA317,953k)  consist  of  investment management  fees of \\xA314,127k  (\\xA311,964k) and administrative  expenses of \\xA35,922k (\\xA35,989k).   Administrative  expenses  include  property  and  other  costs  not connected to the ongoing investment business of the Company of \\xA3471k (\\xA3394k). 3. The  diluted  earnings  per  share  is  calculated using the weighted average number  of ordinary shares, which includes 1,611 (22,331) shares held in a trust that  was set up to satisfy awards  made under historic share award schemes. The basic  earnings per share is calculated by excluding these shares. The basic Net Asset Value per share calculation also excludes these shares. 4. All  expenses  are  accounted  for  on  an  accruals  basis. Where there is a connection  with the  maintenance or  enhancement of  the value of the Company's investments  and  it  is  consistent  with  the AICSORP, the Company attributes indirect expenditure including management fees and finance costs, 25% to revenue and 75% to capital profits. Specific exceptions to this general principle are:   * Expenses which under the AIC SORP are chargeable to revenue profits are     recorded directly to revenue.   * Expenses connected with rental income and mineral rights income are included     as administrative expenses.

Highlights Net profit after tax of $983.0 million, down 23.3% primarily due to net revaluation gains of investment properties being lower than those recognised in FY19  AFFO and Distribution of 50.3 cents per security, in line with FY19 despite COVID-19 impacts  Rent collections for the Dexus portfolio were strong at 98% for FY20  Return on Contributed Equity (ROCE) of 9.0%  Gearing (look-through) remains conservative at 24.3%  $1.6 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities  High occupancy of 96.5% for the Dexus office portfolio and 95.6% for the Dexus industrial portfolio  Outperformance of both the Dexus office and industrial portfolios relative to their relevant MSCI/PCA benchmarks over one, three and five years to 31 March 2020  All funds performing with Dexus Wholesale Property Fund (DWPF) continuing to outperform its benchmark across all time periods and Healthcare Wholesale Property Fund (HWPF) achieving a one-year return of 10.9%.

Our response to the challenging operating environment caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with how we were placed going into the crisis, positions us well for the recovery. Response to COVID-19  Darren Steinberg said: \"In recent years we have actively undertaken initiatives to improve asset quality and portfolio diversification, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through transactions, developments and favourable asset valuations we achieved growth in funds under management, consistent with our focus on leadership in office and being a wholesale partner of choice. We increased the group's exposure to the industrial and healthcare property sectors alongside our third party capital partners, further diversifying our position across these growing sectors. We have also invested in property technology initiatives and enhanced our product offering, working proactively with our customers to provide workspace solutions that enable additional flexibility and a seamless experience. \"When the pandemic took hold in late March 2020, our number one priority was to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the people in our buildings. With government restrictions implemented across our key markets, we kept our buildings operational to enable business continuity for the essential services of our customers. We actively supported the viability of our small business customers most affected by the crisis through the provision of rent relief, consistent with the Code of Conduct. These actions have impacted our financial result for the year which, until the last quarter, was tracking ahead of expectations. In response to the uncertain environment, we implemented cost reduction initiatives and secured additional debt facilities. We also withdrew our FY20 guidance until there was further certainty on cash flow, and in early June 2020 announced revised guidance for a distribution consistent with FY19, which we have delivered on.\" While these challenges adversely impacted the financial result and the Dexus security price, Dexus progressed its strategic objectives and delivered solid operational achievements for the year. Financial result Dexus's net profit after tax was $983.0 million, down 23.3% on the prior year. This movement was primarily driven by net revaluation gains of investment properties of $612.4 million, which were $160.7 million lower than FY19. These revaluation gains primarily drove the 38 cent or 3.6% increase in net tangible asset (NTA) backing per security to $10.86 at 30 June 2020. Underlying Funds from Operations (FFO) per security of 63.5 cents, which excludes trading profits, grew by 1.0% despite the impact of rent relief provided, highlighting the contribution from the funds management business and non-recurring cost reduction measures. AFFO and distribution per security of 50.3 cents, was consistent with the prior year and in line with revised guidance provided on 1 June 2020, with the distribution payout ratio remaining in line with free cash flow in accordance with Dexus's distribution policy. The distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2020 of 23.3 cents per security will be paid to Dexus Security holders on Friday, 28 August 2020. Rent collections for the Dexus portfolio were strong at 98% in FY20, with 92% collected in the fourth quarter of FY20. Dexus achieved a ROCE2 for FY20 of 9.0% driven largely by AFFO and revaluation gains from completed developments at 240 St Georges Terrace, Perth and the city retail component of 175 Pitt Street, Sydney. Dexus continued to maintain a strong and conservative balance sheet with gearing (look-through)3 at 24.3%, well below the target range of 30-40%, and $1.6 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities. Chief Financial Officer, Alison Harrop said: \"We have remained focused on preserving capital while selectively investing in assets with solid fundamentals and divesting non-core or lower returning assets. We enhanced our financial position by sourcing $1.85 billion of debt, including the issue of $700 million of 10 and 12-year Medium-Term Notes, which increased our debt duration to 6.9 years and further diversified our funding sources. In this uncertain environment, we remain focused on maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.\" Dexus has manageable debt expiries in late FY21 and limited development commitments of circa$180 million remaining to spend until the end of FY22. Dexus remains within all of its debt covenant limits and continues to retain its credit ratings of A-/A3 from S&amp;P and Moody's respectively.

Executive General Manager, Office, Kevin George said: \"Our office portfolio was performing well leading into the crisis with high occupancy and significant leasing success, including our leasing focus at 80 Collins Street which achieved record rents and set new benchmarks for the Melbourne CBD.\" In the current environment, office leasing enquiry levels have fallen, and inspection rates have slowed however occupancy has remained high at 96.5%. Lead indicators point to a period of uncertainty in the Australian office market, with demand across the major CBD markets likely to be patchy in the short term. In times of uncertainty, high-quality and well-leased assets can be expected to hold their value better than lower quality assets due to their appeal to both occupants and purchasers as well as their relative scarcity. At 30 June 2020, Prime grade9 buildings comprised 94% of Dexus's office portfolio. Office portfolio like-for-like income growth10 was +2.4% (FY19: +3.4%), impacted by rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus office portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020. As Australia's largest owner and manager of office buildings, Dexus has taken a leadership role in the operational aspects of assisting Australian businesses to return back to their offices in a safe manner and consistent with government guidelines. This has involved working with the authorities on lift capacities and end-of-trip facilities, as well as regular customer communications and surveys. Kevin George said: \"Developing meaningful partnerships with our customers, local communities and suppliers has a valuable impact on the people in and around our buildings. Our customers are at the heart of what we do, and we invest time in understanding their needs and delivering solutions to help them thrive in their workspaces. Our team is focused on enhancing our customers' experience as shown through the annual customer survey which returned a high customer Net Promoter Score of +50 (out of a possible range of -100 to +100), an increase from +46 in FY19, reflecting the strength of our relationships. \"We leveraged our workplace consulting business, Six Ideas by Dexus, to gain insights into the future of workspace. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the flexible working trend as well as some of the long-term structural trends, like technology, that have underpinned our workspace strategy.

During the year, Dexus leased 181,472 square metres8 of industrial space across 95 transactions, with the portfolio continuing to benefit from an uptick in logistics and e-commerce demand with non-discretionary and online retail sectors experiencing growth during the crisis. Portfolio occupancy remains high at 95.6%, however was lower than FY19 at 97.0% primarily due to vacancy at Axxess Corporate Park. Industrial portfolio like-for-like income growth11 was -2.1% (FY19: +2.5%) impacted by expiries at Axxess Corporate Park in addition to rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus industrial portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020. The weighted average capitalisation rate across the total property portfolio tightened 21 basis points over the year to 5.05%. The weighted average capitalisation rate of the Dexus office portfolio tightened 18 basis points from 5.15% at 30 June 2019 to 4.97% at 30 June 2020 and for the Dexus industrial portfolio tightened 26 basis points from 5.92% at 30 June 2019 to 5.66% at 30 June 2020. Funds Management Dexus manages $15.5 billion of funds on behalf of 77 third party clients. The funds platform raised circa $955 million of equity for new and existing funds, including DWPF which raised circa $240 million from existing investors to fund its future development pipeline. DWPF continues to outperform its benchmark over one, three, five, seven and ten years and HWPF continued to deliver strong performance, achieving a one-year return of 10.9%. All partnerships have performed well, exceeding their return objectives for the year. Executive General Manager, Funds Management, Deborah Coakley said: \"We remain a real estate partner of choice across the Australian office, industrial, retail and healthcare sectors and we continue to attract significant interest from domestic and international capital partners seeking to invest in Australian property. In the current environment we are focused on delivering continued superior performance and navigating the unanticipated market conditions for our third party capital partners, while accelerating opportunities to expand our funds platform, including the launch of an unlisted opportunity fund series in FY21.\" During the year, GIC acquired an additional 24% interest in DALT, bringing its total share of the partnership to 49%, and entered into a new commercial JV with Dexus that acquired 50% of Rialto Towers in Melbourne. GIC holds a 90% share in the JV and Dexus holds the remaining 10%. Dexus is the investment manager of the JV and property manager of the entire Rialto Towers complex. HWPF welcomed two new investors, completed the development of the new Calvary Adelaide Hospital, and acquired the North Shore Health Hub, Stage 1 currently under development at 12 Frederick Street, St Leonards. Post 30 June 2020, HWPF acquired the College Junction building in Clayfield, Brisbane, a modern healthcare facility that accommodates Qscan's head office, radiology clinic and other healthcare tenants. Developments and transactions During the year, Dexus completed $1.1 billion of developments across the group including its office development at 240 St Georges Terrace in Perth (96% committed), The Annex at 12 Creek Street, Brisbane (24% committed) and the office and retail component of 80 Collins Street (94% committed). In addition, three city retail projects, four specialised industrial facilities and HWPF's new Calvary Adelaide Hospital were also completed. Dexus's group development pipeline now stands at a cost of $10.6 billion, of which $5.4 billion sits within the Dexus portfolio and $5.2 billion within third party funds. Dexus has only circa $180 million remaining to spend on its committed development projects until the end of FY22. Construction continues at the $84 million Richlands project in Queensland and the $150 million South Granville project in NSW, both industrial development projects held within DALT. Construction also progressed at three other industrial properties, taking the total committed group industrial pipeline to over 270,000 square metres. Chief Investment Officer, Ross Du Vernet said: \"We've made significant progress across our city shaping developments at Central Place Sydney, 60 Collins Street in Melbourne and Waterfront Brisbane. In the current uncertain environment, our risk is reduced by the fact that these assets are currently income producing and the majority are owned in partnership with our third party capital partners, allowing us to progress planning to enhance the optionality of these developments.\" Dexus had an active year of transactions, undertaking $1.2 billion of acquisitions and $1.0 billion of divestments across the group, recycling capital to strengthen Dexus's balance sheet and enhance flexibility. Dexus divested two assets at pricing in line with their prior book value, including Garema Court 140-180 City Walk, Canberra and 45 Clarence Street, Sydney which is subject to FIRB approval. In addition, Dexus made a number of smaller acquisitions and post 30 June 2020, settled on the divestment of Finlay Crisp Centre in Canberra. Trading Dexus realised $35.3 million of trading profits (net of tax) driven by the sale of the initial 25% of 201 Elizabeth Street in Sydney and progress at the North Shore Health Hub in St Leonards, currently under construction and sold to HWPF on a fund-through basis. Post 30 June 2020, Dexus entered into agreements to sell a portfolio of six trading assets to DALT across two tranches and exercised the option to sell its remaining 25% interest in 201 Elizabeth Street. These transactions (including the North Shore Health Hub) are expected to contribute circa $85 million to pre-tax trading profits across FY21 and FY22 (in the event the options over the second tranche are exercised). Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) update The impact of the Australian drought and bushfire crisis that dominated the summer of 2019-20 increased investor focus on the resilience of Dexus's properties to climate change. The launch of Dexus's Towards Climate Resilience report in June 2020 reinforces the group's approach to addressing climate change and enhancing resilience. This year Dexus progressed its net zero emissions by 2030 goal by improving energy and water efficiency, delivering its 2020 NABERS Energy and Water targets, and expanding the adoption of renewable energy sources, including the rollout of solar projects across properties in Queensland and New South Wales. Dexus gained global recognition for its commitment to its net zero goal, enhancing sustainability disclosure and its ongoing focus on portfolio resilience, achieving industry leadership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and a position on the CDP Climate Change A List. Dexus was again recognised by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) for its active commitment to and progress towards gender equality across its workplace - being awarded an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality (EOCGE) citation for 2019-20. Dexus's highly engaged workforce is committed to delivering on its strategy, reflected in the high employee Net Promoter Score of +61. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Dexus employees have played an instrumental role in ensuring the safety of customers, contractors and the community across the group property portfolios. Dexus's ongoing focus on safety is measured by independent external safety audits across its corporate and management workspaces, and this year Dexus achieved an average score of 100%. Summary and outlook Darren Steinberg said: \"Dexus is well positioned, with a track record of delivering on strategy, a stable and experienced management team, a quality property portfolio with a diversified customer base, and a strong balance sheet. \"In recent years we have demonstrated our ability to capitalise on opportunities while also preparing for periods of uncertainty. We have improved our portfolio composition through the acquisition of quality properties with solid fundamentals to drive long-term returns, while taking advantage of the good years to recycle properties in non-core locations. \"Our substantial city-shaping development pipeline comprises projects that will deliver long-term value beyond the recovery period, while our diversified funds management business is performing and continues to attract interest from new capital. \"Our team's knowledge, expertise and ability to innovate, combined with our investments in technology and workspace consulting, will help us position for the recovery. \"Office property is a long-term asset class and has shown its resilience to perform through the cycle. However, with Australia in a recession, we are preparing for subdued tenant demand and increased vacancy levels in our core office markets. In this environment we remain focused on maintaining high portfolio occupancy. \"We will also make decisions that set the group up to perform over the long term. We will selectively recycle assets, which may result in short-term earnings dilution but will enable us to reinvest into opportunities that we believe will drive stronger investor returns over the next decade. \"Our immediate priorities are summarised across five key areas: assisting Australian businesses in returning safely to their workplaces, optimising our property portfolio composition, accelerating opportunities to expand our funds management platform, continuing to work with our customers on the future of workspace, and progressing the city-shaping development pipeline.\" Dexus intends to deliver a distribution in line with free cash flow in FY21. However, taking into account continued uncertainty, Dexus is not providing distribution per security guidance for the 12 months ended 30 June 2021.

Our response to the challenging operating environment caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with how we were placed going into the crisis, positions us well for the recovery.  Response to COVID-19  Darren Steinberg said: 'In recent years we have actively undertaken initiatives to improve asset quality and portfolio diversification, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through transactions, developments and favourable asset valuations we achieved growth in funds under management, consistent with our focus on leadership in office and being a wholesale partner of choice. We increased the group's exposure to the industrial and healthcare property sectors alongside our third party capital partners, further diversifying our position across these growing sectors. We have also invested in property technology initiatives and enhanced our product offering, working proactively with our customers to provide workspace solutions that enable additional flexibility and a seamless experience.  'When the pandemic took hold in late March 2020, our number one priority was to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the people in our buildings. With government restrictions implemented across our key markets, we kept our buildings operational to enable business continuity for the essential services of our customers. We actively supported the viability of our small business customers most affected by the crisis through the provision of rent relief, consistent with the Code of Conduct. These actions have impacted our financial result for the year which, until the last quarter, was tracking ahead of expectations. In response to the uncertain environment, we implemented cost reduction initiatives and secured additional debt facilities. We also withdrew our FY20 guidance until there was further certainty on cash flow, and in early June 2020 announced revised guidance for a distribution consistent with FY19, which we have delivered on.'  While these challenges adversely impacted the financial result and the Dexus security price, Dexus progressed its strategic objectives and delivered solid operational achievements for the year.  Financial result  Dexus's net profit after tax was $983.0 million, down 23.3% on the prior year. This movement was primarily driven by net revaluation gains of investment properties of $612.4 million, which were $160.7 million lower than FY19. These revaluation gains primarily drove the 38 cent or 3.6% increase in net tangible asset (NTA) backing per security to $10.86 at 30 June 2020.  Underlying Funds from Operations (FFO) per security of 63.5 cents, which excludes trading profits, grew by 1.0% despite the impact of rent relief provided, highlighting the contribution from the funds management business and non-recurring cost reduction measures.  AFFO and distribution per security of 50.3 cents, was consistent with the prior year and in line with revised guidance provided on 1 June 2020, with the distribution payout ratio remaining in line with free cash flow in accordance with Dexus's distribution policy. The distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2020 of 23.3 cents per security will be paid to Dexus Security holders on Friday, 28 August 2020.  Rent collections for the Dexus portfolio were strong at 98% in FY20, with 92% collected in the fourth quarter of FY20.  Dexus achieved a ROCE2 for FY20 of 9.0% driven largely by AFFO and revaluation gains from completed developments at 240 St Georges Terrace, Perth and the city retail component of 175 Pitt Street, Sydney.  Dexus continued to maintain a strong and conservative balance sheet with gearing (look-through)3 at 24.3%, well below the target range of 30-40%, and $1.6 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities.  Chief Financial Officer, Alison Harrop said: 'We have remained focused on preserving capital while selectively investing in assets with solid fundamentals and divesting non-core or lower returning assets. We enhanced our financial position by sourcing $1.85 billion of debt, including the issue of $700 million of 10 and 12-year Medium-Term Notes, which increased our debt duration to 6.9 years and further diversified our funding sources. In this uncertain environment, we remain focused on maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.'  Dexus has manageable debt expiries in late FY21 and limited development commitments of circa $180 million remaining to spend until the end of FY22. Dexus remains within all of its debt covenant limits and continues to retain its credit ratings of A-/A3 from S&amp;P and Moody's respectively.

Executive General Manager, Office, Kevin George said: 'Our office portfolio was performing well leading into the crisis with high occupancy and significant leasing success, including our leasing focus at 80 Collins Street which achieved record rents and set new benchmarks for the Melbourne CBD.'  In the current environment, office leasing enquiry levels have fallen, and inspection rates have slowed however occupancy has remained high at 96.5%. Lead indicators point to a period of uncertainty in the Australian office market, with demand across the major CBD markets likely to be patchy in the short term. In times of uncertainty, high-quality and well-leased assets can be expected to hold their value better than lower quality assets due to their appeal to both occupants and purchasers as well as their relative scarcity. At 30 June 2020, Prime grade9 buildings comprised 94% of Dexus's office portfolio.  Office portfolio like-for-like income growth10 was +2.4% (FY19: +3.4%), impacted by rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus office portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020.  As Australia's largest owner and manager of office buildings, Dexus has taken a leadership role in the operational aspects of assisting Australian businesses to return back to their offices in a safe manner and consistent with government guidelines. This has involved working with the authorities on lift capacities and end-of-trip facilities, as well as regular customer communications and surveys.  Kevin George said: 'Developing meaningful partnerships with our customers, local communities and suppliers has a valuable impact on the people in and around our buildings. Our customers are at the heart of what we do, and we invest time in understanding their needs and delivering solutions to help them thrive in their workspaces. Our team is focused on enhancing our customers' experience as shown through the annual customer survey which returned a high customer Net Promoter Score of +50 (out of a possible range of -100 to +100), an increase from +46 in FY19, reflecting the strength of our relationships.  'We leveraged our workplace consulting business, Six Ideas by Dexus, to gain insights into the future of workspace. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the flexible working trend as well as some of the long-term structural trends, like technology, that have underpinned our workspace strategy.

During the year, Dexus leased 181,472 square metres8 of industrial space across 95 transactions, with the portfolio continuing to benefit from an uptick in logistics and e-commerce demand with non-discretionary and online retail sectors experiencing growth during the crisis.  Portfolio occupancy remains high at 95.6%, however was lower than FY19 at 97.0% primarily due to vacancy at Axxess Corporate Park. Industrial portfolio like-for-like income growth11 was -2.1% (FY19: +2.5%) impacted by expiries at Axxess Corporate Park in addition to rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus industrial portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020.  The weighted average capitalisation rate across the total property portfolio tightened 21 basis points over the year to 5.05%. The weighted average capitalisation rate of the Dexus office portfolio tightened 18 basis points from 5.15% at 30 June 2019 to 4.97% at 30 June 2020 and for the Dexus industrial portfolio tightened 26 basis points from 5.92% at 30 June 2019 to 5.66% at 30 June 2020.  Funds Management  Dexus manages $15.5 billion of funds on behalf of 77 third party clients.  The funds platform raised circa $955 million of equity for new and existing funds, including DWPF which raised circa $240 million from existing investors to fund its future development pipeline. DWPF continues to outperform its benchmark over one, three, five, seven and ten years and HWPF continued to deliver strong performance, achieving a one-year return of 10.9%. All partnerships have performed well, exceeding their return objectives for the year.  Executive General Manager, Funds Management, Deborah Coakley said: 'We remain a real estate partner of choice across the Australian office, industrial, retail and healthcare sectors and we continue to attract significant interest from domestic and international capital partners seeking to invest in Australian property. In the current environment we are focused on delivering continued superior performance and navigating the unanticipated market conditions for our third party capital partners, while accelerating opportunities to expand our funds platform, including the launch of an unlisted opportunity fund series in FY21.'  During the year, GIC acquired an additional 24% interest in DALT, bringing its total share of the partnership to 49%, and entered into a new commercial JV with Dexus that acquired 50% of Rialto Towers in Melbourne. GIC holds a 90% share in the JV and Dexus holds the remaining 10%. Dexus is the investment manager of the JV and property manager of the entire Rialto Towers complex.  HWPF welcomed two new investors, completed the development of the new Calvary Adelaide Hospital, and acquired the North Shore Health Hub, Stage 1 currently under development at 12 Frederick Street, St Leonards. Post 30 June 2020, HWPF acquired the College Junction building in Clayfield, Brisbane, a modern healthcare facility that accommodates Qscan's head office, radiology clinic and other healthcare tenants.  Developments and transactions  During the year, Dexus completed $1.1 billion of developments across the group including its office development at 240 St Georges Terrace in Perth (96% committed), The Annex at 12 Creek Street, Brisbane (24% committed) and the office and retail component of 80 Collins Street (94% committed). In addition, three city retail projects, four specialised industrial facilities and HWPF's new Calvary Adelaide Hospital were also completed.  Dexus's group development pipeline now stands at a cost of $10.6 billion, of which $5.4 billion sits within the Dexus portfolio and $5.2 billion within third party funds. Dexus has only circa $180 million remaining to spend on its committed development projects until the end of FY22.  Construction continues at the $84 million Richlands project in Queensland and the $150 million South Granville project in NSW, both industrial development projects held within DALT. Construction also progressed at three other industrial properties, taking the total committed group industrial pipeline to over 270,000 square metres.  Chief Investment Officer, Ross Du Vernet said: 'We've made significant progress across our city shaping developments at Central Place Sydney, 60 Collins Street in Melbourne and Waterfront Brisbane. In the current uncertain environment, our risk is reduced by the fact that these assets are currently income producing and the majority are owned in partnership with our third party capital partners, allowing us to progress planning to enhance the optionality of these developments.'  Dexus had an active year of transactions, undertaking $1.2 billion of acquisitions and $1.0 billion of divestments across the group, recycling capital to strengthen Dexus's balance sheet and enhance flexibility. Dexus divested two assets at pricing in line with their prior book value, including Garema Court 140-180 City Walk, Canberra and 45 Clarence Street, Sydney which is subject to FIRB approval. In addition, Dexus made a number of smaller acquisitions and post 30 June 2020, settled on the divestment of Finlay Crisp Centre in Canberra.  Trading  Dexus realised $35.3 million of trading profits (net of tax) driven by the sale of the initial 25% of 201 Elizabeth Street in Sydney and progress at the North Shore Health Hub in St Leonards, currently under construction and sold to HWPF on a fund-through basis.  Post 30 June 2020, Dexus entered into agreements to sell a portfolio of six trading assets to DALT across two tranches and exercised the option to sell its remaining 25% interest in 201 Elizabeth Street. These transactions (including the North Shore Health Hub) are expected to contribute circa $85 million to pre-tax trading profits across FY21 and FY22 (in the event the options over the second tranche are exercised).  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) update  The impact of the Australian drought and bushfire crisis that dominated the summer of 2019-20 increased investor focus on the resilience of Dexus's properties to climate change. The launch of Dexus's Towards Climate Resilience report in June 2020 reinforces the group's approach to addressing climate change and enhancing resilience.  This year Dexus progressed its net zero emissions by 2030 goal by improving energy and water efficiency, delivering its 2020 NABERS Energy and Water targets, and expanding the adoption of renewable energy sources, including the rollout of solar projects across properties in Queensland and New South Wales.  Dexus gained global recognition for its commitment to its net zero goal, enhancing sustainability disclosure and its ongoing focus on portfolio resilience, achieving industry leadership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and a position on the CDP Climate Change A List.  Dexus was again recognised by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) for its active commitment to and progress towards gender equality across its workplace - being awarded an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality (EOCGE) citation for 2019-20.  Dexus's highly engaged workforce is committed to delivering on its strategy, reflected in the high employee Net Promoter Score of +61. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Dexus employees have played an instrumental role in ensuring the safety of customers, contractors and the community across the group property portfolios. Dexus's ongoing focus on safety is measured by independent external safety audits across its corporate and management workspaces, and this year Dexus achieved an average score of 100%.  Summary and outlook  Darren Steinberg said: 'Dexus is well positioned, with a track record of delivering on strategy, a stable and experienced management team, a quality property portfolio with a diversified customer base, and a strong balance sheet.  'In recent years we have demonstrated our ability to capitalise on opportunities while also preparing for periods of uncertainty. We have improved our portfolio composition through the acquisition of quality properties with solid fundamentals to drive long-term returns, while taking advantage of the good years to recycle properties in non-core locations.  'Our substantial city-shaping development pipeline comprises projects that will deliver long-term value beyond the recovery period, while our diversified funds management business is performing and continues to attract interest from new capital.  'Our team's knowledge, expertise and ability to innovate, combined with our investments in technology and workspace consulting, will help us position for the recovery.  'Office property is a long-term asset class and has shown its resilience to perform through the cycle. However, with Australia in a recession, we are preparing for subdued tenant demand and increased vacancy levels in our core office markets. In this environment we remain focused on maintaining high portfolio occupancy.  'We will also make decisions that set the group up to perform over the long term. We will selectively recycle assets, which may result in short-term earnings dilution but will enable us to reinvest into opportunities that we believe will drive stronger investor returns over the next decade.  'Our immediate priorities are summarised across five key areas: assisting Australian businesses in returning safely to their workplaces, optimising our property portfolio composition, accelerating opportunities to expand our funds management platform, continuing to work with our customers on the future of workspace, and progressing the city-shaping development pipeline.'

Over the last six years or so, it has disbursed several hundred million US dollars to several hundred projects in different ministries of the government as well as to NGOs.</p><p>However, unfortunately over time, a number of instances of misallocation were brought to light by journalists and NGOs such as Transparency InternationalBangladesh (TIB). </p><p>From the point of view of the government, it is not important whether the exact facts in the reports were accurate or not, rather the focus should be on the fact that the overall impression of this project fund was quite negative; it should be remembered that once reputation is lost, it becomes very hard to regain it. </p><p>Bangladesh Climate Resilience Fund (BCRF)<br/> This fund was set up alongside the BCCTF but with international funds from development partners such as the United Kingdom, the European Commission, Denmark and others. It had a different governance structure with the donors represented in its governing board and was also managed by the World Bank rather than the government.</p><p>It also allocated funds to somewhat larger projects than the BCCTF and had a more robust evaluation system. It managed a few hundred millions of US dollars that were being allocated to fewer (but bigger) projects than the BCCTF. However, it was quite slow in disbursing funds and it is now being wound up with money left unspent, according to newspaper reports.</p><p>Palli Karma Shahayak Foundation (PKSF)<br/> Both the BCRF as well as the BCCTF had made a decision to pre-allocate 10 percent of their total funding to the civil society to support grassroots and community level adaptation to climate change. PKSF, on the other hand, was chosen as the agency to manage those funds. </p><p>At the time, PKSF did not have any experience on climate change but had disbursed many hundreds of millions of US dollars to several NGOs for micro- credit and it had a very robust monitoring system.</p><p>PKSF set up a new climate change cell to handle the climate funds it received from both BCRF as well as BCCTF and has, over the years, funded many NGOs who are working at community level.</p><p>From a simple review of the information provided on allocation of funds at their respective websites, PKSF is by far the most transparent and, by all accounts, the best run of the various funds.</p><p>Pilot Project on Climate Resilience (PPCR)<br/> This was a separate fund from the World Bank in Washington, as it was managed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Bangladesh, and involved the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to bring in the private sector to tackle climate change. The task of involving private sector in mitigation is relatively easy but bringing them into adaptation is not. So it has not been easy to find private sector interest here.</p><p>Green Climate Fund (GCF)<br/> This is the new fund set up under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to channel $100 billion a year from the developed countries to the developing countries to help tackle climate change. Bangladesh will have to compete with other countries in order to get funds from the GCF. Fortunately, Bangladesh was among the first eight countries to be allocated funding by the GCF. </p><p>Lessons learnt<br/> First of all, the time for having standalone climate funds, such as the BCCTF and BCRF, are over, as the national planning and finance systems are fully geared up to mainstream climate finance with national development finance. The government has indeed already recognised this fact by designating the Economic Resources Division (ERD) to be the National Designated Authority (NDA) for the GCF. </p><p>Additionally, ministries across the government have now acquired enough knowledge of climate change to enable them to start mainstreaming it into their regular development plans.</p><p>Moreover, the need for Bangladesh to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over the next fifteen years allows climate change finance to be well integrated across the SDGs as well. </p><p>Finally and perhaps most importantly, we need to focus on the need to put in robust systems of transparency of climate fund allocations by governments and other donors, along with robust systems of oversight and accountability by both the sectors of government responsible for those functions, such as the Auditor General and Parliamentary Standing Committees, as well as by third party monitors, including the citizens themselves.</p><p>The $100 billion a year promised by the developed countries - to begin from the year 2020 - to the developing countries is a floor and will grow over time. Bangladesh, being one of the most vulnerable developing countries, has a good chance to get significant amounts from the GCF, but it will have to compete with other countries to get it.

Extreme climate disasters have become the \u201cnew normal\u201d, with devastating effects on the rich and the poor alike. Obviously, the risks to economies and societies have become an issue of security concern for the academic, policy and military communities. However, there seem to be widely differing perspectives on this issue among these communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word \u201csecurity\u201d comes from the Latin phrase sine cura, which means \u201cwithout worry\u201d. This root meaning conveys what security should actually mean as a spaceless/timeless concept. In fact, the genealogy of climate-development-security linkage goes back centuries. Many authors then sought to explain developments and conflicts in the American South and other regions by climate determinism. During the first half of the last century, Huntington and others tried to move beyond this climate historicism to naturalising the causes of conflicts and political unrest. Now, a group of academics argue that the ideology of this climate reductionism has seeped into the consciousness of the national security community.</p><p>From the perspective of national sovereignty, beginning with the state-centric military security, we witnessed the framings of economic security in the 1970s, followed by a quest for redefining national security, with rapid environmental degradation. This new discourse argued that the traditional view of military-focused \u201cnational security\u201d is growing to be irrelevant as it could not address new global issues which were non-military security threats such as poverty, underdevelopment and environmental threats. The term \u201cenvironmental security\u201d first appeared in the 1987 landmark report titled \u201cOur Common Future\u201d; this was the first authoritative source that broached a linkage between security risks and environmental degradation. Climate security is the latest accretion to this discourse, pioneered by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she declared at the UN General Assembly in 1989 that climate change threatened life itself that \u201cwe must battle to preserve\u201d.</p><p>From a review of academic and policy literature of the last two decades, I could make out at least three distinct framings about the relationship between climate change and security: environmental conflict, human security and climate resilience. The first is the environmental conflict perspective, according to which the security policy community, such as departments of defence, plays the lead role, while in the vulnerability-focused human security perspective, finance, planning and development agencies play the lead role. The former focuses on state-centric security, with military preparedness to address \u201cthreat multipliers\u201d emanating from climate change. But the human security lens places citizens\u2019 wellbeing at the centre. Here, definitional expansiveness is a powerful attribute of the human security lens, developed in the mid-1990s by the late Dr Mahbub Ul Haq and UNDP.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The third is the climate resilience discourse. This framing avoids the language of threats/conflicts and focuses on risk governance as a shared responsibility by the whole range of actors involved in development, security and disaster governance. It attempts to bridge the two groups, focusing on resilience, meaning the ability of a system to withstand shocks and improve, through addressing both direct and indirect risks from climate change. Direct threats/risks include the loss of supreme value of a nation, i.e. threat to statehood from sea level rise for many Small Island Developing States (SIDS) which are likely to face \u201cwatery death\u201d. This raises legal complications with novel problems of whether it is viable to maintain statehood without territory and its attendant problems of exclusive economic zones and other marine sovereignty issues. There is also a host of indirect or second-order risks regarded as \u201cthreat multipliers\u201d, which are likely to weaken global economy/security. The Western policy community sees climate refugees as a big threat as these refugees risk taking perilous journeys to reach the shores of Western countries. Conflicts may also arise from climate change-induced potential availability of resources, with serious geopolitical implications, or from adaptation measures as in water management in the Indus basin, Ganges or Jordan rivers.</p><p>One interesting aspect to observe is that the role of proponents has also changed. Initiated by academics to reconceptualise security grounded on environmental resource scarcity, the discourse on climate security is now dominated by the policy and military establishments. Most of the political leaders across the globe pronounce climate change as a security threat. Over 70 percent of the countries which submitted their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC have included climate change in their national security strategies. The General Assembly on June 3, 2009 passed Resolution 63/281 in which it acknowledged that the impacts of climate change could have serious security implications, reaffirming the UNFCCC as the key forum to address climate change.</p><p>But because of the snail\u2019s pace in climate negotiations under the UNFCCC for the last two decades, there is a search for alternative forums to address the issue of climate security. The UN Security Council emerged as an alternative forum and potentially the most powerful supranational organ.\u200b Already, it has convened several formal and informal meetings, the latest being in January this year. But there are sharp differences among permanent members of the Council, with France, UK and US supporting its role, with China and Russia opposing it. The Group of 77 is also divided as to whether the involvement of the Security Council will lead to a positive outcome. The argument in support asserts that since climate change poses grave security threats, the Council has the mandate to involve itself in the deliberations and actions. The opposing group argues that the Council, in expanding its role, trespasses to other territories of the UN organs, where climate change and sustainable development issues are considered.\u200b As of yet, there is no consensus on whether the Security Council should have a proactive role in addressing climate change. But the debate is likely to continue.</p><p>While almost two trillion dollars are spent yearly by countries on military defence, aimed at addressing perceived threats from enemies, the threats of climate change as the common enemy to each citizen and nation-state are real. The irony is that even a fraction of the pledged USD 100 billion is not available to address the deadly threats posed by climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Mizan R Khan is Professor of Environmental Science and Management, North South University.)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Daily Star (Bangladesh)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["The term \u201cenvironmental security\u201d first appeared in the 1987 landmark report titled \u201cOur Common Future\u201d; this was the first authoritative source that broached a linkage between security risks and environmental degradation.

After all, KMC\u2019s clinics had recorded as many as 75 dengue cases during June and July of that year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Compare this alacrity with the response to another public health problem \u2013 poor air quality. It has taken almost 20 years \u2013 starting with a petition in 1999 \u2013 for the government to realise that air pollution is an issue that needs urgent attention. This realisation, too, came about only when, on 27 November 2018, the National Green Tribunal, following the Supreme Court\u2019s direction that government officials be prosecuted for inaction on polluters, imposed a fine of Rs 5 crore on the West Bengal government for non-performance of its environmental duties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The NGT pointed to the many steps it had listed in its order in 2016: phase out old vehicles, tighten checks on emission compliance, stop open incineration of waste, introduce remote sensing devices to monitor emissions, and increase the number of monitoring stations. It seemed that the government had been lax across the board.</p><p>While a Rs 5 crore fine may be inconsequential to the budget of the state government, it should serve as a wake-up call. The same order threatens additional fines of Rs 1 crore for every month of delay in complying with the steps listed by the court. It may be sheer coincidence but, within two weeks of the order, in mid- December 2018, the Environment Minister announced a \u201ctemporary strategy\u201d to switch buses from highly polluting diesel to relatively clean CNG by bringing in tankers carrying the gas. In addition, 80 electric buses are to be introduced \u2013 20 now and the rest in sync with the extension of recharging facilities.</p><p>So, why does the mere possibility of dengue deaths trigger such alacrity on the part of KMC while the proven mortality caused by air pollution gets ignored, even though deaths due to air pollution are greater than dengue deaths by several multiples? One reason, of course, is the relative absence of cause-and-effect data. A blood test can quickly identify dengue as a cause of death, while the slow, insidious damage done by pollution to respiratory tracts, cardiac health and even brain development needs well-designed, ideally longitudinal studies based on reliable records at the ground level. The public are being short-changed by the inadequacies in the health information system.</p><p>In this context, the announcement by the new Mayor of Kolkata, Mr Firhad Hakim, that attention to the city\u2019s environment will be a priority for him raises hopes. The need has been longstanding but rarely has a politician recognised the need, let alone put it on his list of priorities. In fact, in recent years the city has been subjected to politicians for whom issues such as environmental health and sustainability were of the least concern. Examples abound: unnecessary and excessive consumption of electricity for decorative street lighting, determined efforts to build a flyover across the protected east Kolkata wetlands, use of antiquated and poisonous hot-mix technology for laying road surfaces, banning of bicycles rather than making provisions for their safe use\u2026the list could lead to reader fatigue.</p><p>So if under the new Mayor, Kolkatans were to look for assurance that inaugural statements will in fact be translated into action, what could some of these actions be?</p><p>The first \u2013 and perhaps most easily doable step \u2013 would be to withdraw the intention declared by the last mayor to build a flyover across the east Kolkata wetlands. The wetlands are a protected area, vital to the ecological health of the city for reasons that have received scientific, legal and societal endorsement in India and internationally. The High Court of Calcutta has passed orders, the state assembly has enacted a law and the government has set up an authority \u2013 all aimed at protecting the east Kolkata wetlands. Against this, the benefits of the proposed flyover are, at best, questionable.</p><p>In the short run perhaps, a few minutes will be saved in journeying to the airport but as universal experience has shown, flyovers are pathetically inadequate at providing a long-term solution because traffic volume expands to fill up the additional roads. Kolkata\u2019s new Mayor would be gifting the city greater climate resilience and environmental health if he sets aside the proposal for this flyover.</p><p>The second issue crying for attention is air quality. Our political leaders have to accept the reality that the November to February months \u2013 which used to be considered the city\u2019s \u201chigh season\u201d \u2013 have become a period when the city becomes a gas chamber. While some causes are beyond control \u2013 cool temperatures, for instance, trap pollutants making the mornings particularly deadly \u2013 mitigation steps can certainly be taken to address others.</p><p>Open burning is a major cause \u2013 conservancy workers, private homes and institutions burn leaf litter with impunity. These certainly could be curtailed with tighter supervision. The other major source of open incineration is the thousands of roadside tea and food shops that rely entirely on coal. The provision of subsidised smokeless coal to such shops in polluted hot spots could be explored; the cost may be quite affordable, especially if it is seen as promoting public health.</p><p>The third area for attention in translating environmental priority into action would be the city\u2019s green cover. Kolkata has been losing green cover because of the greed of squarefoot oriented real estate developers and because of the concretization of pavements. The latter practice weakens trees and makes them more vulnerable in storms. Simple low-cost measures such as putting grates around the base of trees instead of concrete would reduce tree mortality and curb the loss of green cover.</p><p>Along with the protection of existing green cover, three simple low-cost ways of adding new green cover could be considered. The practice of promoting urban forests has been found to produce positive results in terms of reducing heat islands and improving weather stability. Urban forests are dense clumps of trees that do not require large tracts of land; even small areas are enough because the density of the leaves and branches is very effective in capturing pollutants and impacting weather at the micro level: local varieties such as bokul, kadam, pakur and jarul would provide results quickly. Mahogany and debdaru would provide height. Not surprisingly, urban forests have been found to even boost people\u2019s physical and mental health. Cities ranging from Seoul to Melbourne and Athens have undertaken large-scale planting of groves and gardens to reduce pollution, improve local weather and achieve overall climate resilience.</p><p>A second low-cost step in adding green cover would be the promotion of vertical gardens \u2013 planting literally up the sides of structures such as buildings, flyover columns and even the frames of hoardings. Vines and cascading creepers in highly polluted areas could make a significant difference.</p><p>Third, expensive and aesthetically unappealing guardrails could be replaced with dense hedges. Plants such as tagor, kamini and rangon would be ideal. These are evergreen, need very little care and protect motorists from the glare of oncoming traffic headlights. And they have a far lower carbon footprint than painted metal.</p><p>Finally, if Kolkata\u2019s environment is to be a priority under the new mayorship, it needs to be subjected to regular measurement. Technology is now available that gives us real time data on air quality, even on a street-bystreet basis. With remote sensing technology (or Googlemap) we can monitor the city\u2019s canopy periodically and track the actual impact of action steps described above.</p><p>Political will is what has been missing in Kolkata\u2019s environmental battles.

Also, in the recently held Munich Security Conference in Germany, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was invited to speak. In both their speeches, the issue of climate change as a global security issue was highlighted.</p><p>It is therefore high time for Bangladesh to make climate change diplomacy an integral part of the training and capacities of all our foreign service officers going forward.</p><p>First, the Foreign Service Academy should make climate change diplomacy an integral part of the training programme for every new batch of foreign service officers. This was done last year on a pilot basis, which proved quite successful but should become an integral part of every year's training courses.<br/> The second thing to do would be to identify a small group of senior foreign service officers with previous experience in UN systems in New York, Geneva, Nairobi, etc., who could be the leaders on climate change related diplomatic issues. There are quite a few such senior diplomats who have relevant knowledge and experience.</p><p>The foreign office can convene a group of experts on climate change and climate change diplomacy who can continuously advise the diplomats on the current state of knowledge and science when needed. Again, Bangladesh has many such experts to draw on who would be more than willing to provide such advice.</p><p>Some countries, both developed and developing ones, have even appointed a senior diplomat as the climate change envoy. This is something that Bangladesh may also consider going forward.</p><p>At the same time, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change can continue to lead the negotiations in the UNFCCC as well as give advice to diplomats in the non-UNFCCC context.</p><p>In this regard, one of the most important global meetings coming up in September this year is the Climate Summit in New York called by the United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Unlike the UNFCCC meetings where every decision has to be reached through consensus of nearly 200 countries, the Climate Summit will only have leaders who are taking action to tackle climate change.

As a start, governments must urgently put a stop to land grabbing and the conversion of prime agricultural land,\u201d Rivera said.<br/> Wanun Permpibul from Climate Watch Thailand also called on governments to stop using food production land to grow biofuel crops as part of their so-called solution to the climate crisis. He said this does not only make way for deforestation, but also releases large amounts of greenhouse gases and wastes vast areas of arable lands that could feed millions.<br/> Wanun said the massive production of agrofuels is competing with the production of staple foods and forcing millions of poor and vulnerable people to face serious malnutrition problems.<br/> \u201cThe international community needs to ensure that the task of curbing greenhouse gas emissions is seriously pushed forward alongside the other, equally important, mission of safeguarding and enhancing the capacity of people and communities to secure their basic needs in the face of the increasingly devastating impacts of the climate crisis,\u201d he said.<br/> According to the World Food Programme (WFP), the impact on food security by climate change has already begun in Africa, Asia and Latin America, as food production in these regions is seriously jeopardised by more frequent and intense floods, droughts and storms, triggered by the global temperature rise.<br/> WFP has predicted that with the vast majority of the world\u2019s hungry exposed to climate shocks, eradicating hunger requires bold efforts to improve people\u2019s ability to prepare, respond and recover. Failing this, it is estimated that the risk of hunger and malnutrition could rise by up to 20 per cent by 2050.<br/> This prediction was supported by studies on the impacts of climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which estimated that in the scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions, the global production of coarse grains, oil seeds, wheat and rice will decrease by 17 per cent by mid-century.<br/> The United Nation\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation also warned that even without the pressure of climate change, the world is already struggling to feed millions of poor people, especially in Africa and Asia. As of 2016, the number of starving people globally had risen to 815 million.\u00a0<br/> FAO estimates that to catch up with the food demands of a rising world population in 2050, we will need to increase the annual production of crops and livestock by 60 per cent compared to 2006.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Nation (Thailand)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["The Climate justice group has called on international delegates to add food-security assurance to the agenda in climate-change negotiations, because they say it is not just extreme weather, but also improper climate-change solutions that are jeopardising global food stocks.

Many cities in Asean have evolved without any planning at all, leading to very costly social and economic implications and unpopular movements to rearrange their development.</p><p>Jakarta is one of the cities in Asean that has experienced the high cost of community evictions. Only very recently have Jakarta and some other Asean cities begun investing in the development of decent public transportation to better serve the urban and periurban citizens, mostly with the support from big donor countries and/or financial institutions.</p><p>After a long wait, Metro Manila has just completed its Sustainable Development Plan in 2014, popularly known as \u201ca dream plan\u201d that will try to eliminate traffic congestion, prevent households from living in hazardous conditions, remove barriers to mobility and eliminate air pollution.</p><p>Similar moves have also been initiated in other cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Bandar Seri Begawan.</p><p>The lack of financial resources is one of the major issues hampering sustainable development for big and small cities in Asean. Metro Manila\u2019s dream plan will not come cheap and will need around US$52 billion until 2030. The first phase of Jakarta\u2019s MRT is costing around $75 million per kilometer.

Unlike Singapore, which is sustainably well developed and managed, many Asean cities are still struggling with social, economic, ethical and environmental issues.</p><p>Due to the lack of funding and capacity, Asean's cities will not be able to develop and implement holistic solutions. Rather, they keep strangling on low, unsustainable levels instead.</p><p>Any holistic approach to achieve livable urban development requires that economic, social and environmental perspectives supported by enabling factors are translated into participatory, well designed activities.</p><p>This approach will need to be mainstreamed into national and decentralised local-level development plans. This is also in line with the New Urban Agenda and Goal 11 of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).</p><p>As the Environmentally Sustainable Cities (ESC) has been adopted by Asean as the spirit for future urban development, it has to be clear that achieving ESC will be biased toward environmental perspectives only in the beginning. In the long term, it can only be justified if economic and social aspects are also linked to trigger greater sustainability.</p><p>The ESC approach will focus on activities that support programming on, first, low-carbon technologies in which mitigation measures will be directed to achieve carbon neutrality supporting a green economy and green infrastructure. It should also utilise appropriate technologies.</p><p>Second, efficient use of urban natural resources including protecting urban ecosystems and biodiversity, an increase of green spaces and gender-friendly green facilities.

In recent years, our garments exports have lost their duty-free access to the United States of America but despite some initial problems, the sector has managed to survive.</p><p>Hence, LDC graduation is a risk that we will need to face and we need to learn to compete with other developing countries on a level playing field without asking for subsidies for an indefinite period.</p><p>The second risk we will face is that we will no longer be eligible for grants and low interest loans under official development assistance (ODA) from the developed countries, which we have been receiving ever since our independence in 1971. This will no doubt be a difficult habit to kick but it is again the right thing to do.</p><p>Already a number of developed countries have either dropped Bangladesh from their list of bilateral grant recipients or are planning to do so. This will mean that Bangladesh will have to depend on getting higher interest loans if it wants to tap the global capital markets for bringing in foreign investment.</p><p>This is again a better strategy for the country to become a part of the global economy without depending on handouts forever.</p><p>In addition to the risks mentioned above, there are also a number of opportunities associated with the graduation from LDC status.</p><p>The first opportunity is that we can continue to access global climate finance even if we can no longer access ODA. The amount of global funds available for tackling climate change will be USD 100 billion a year starting from 2020 onwards, and will increase each year after that. This will soon overtake the amount of ODA available each year.</p><p>However, in order to access climate finance, we will need to learn the rules of the climate finance game which are quite different from those of development finance.

About 8.6 million people forced to migrate due to weather hazards in 2017 were from Southeast Asia, about 46 per cent of the total number displaced.<br/> Major natural disasters took the form of floods, typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought and landslides that posed a hazard to habitat and the livelihood of people in Southeast Asia, notably in Indonesia and the Philippines.<br/> Torre said natural disasters had already become the biggest reason for mass migration worldwide, not only in Southeast Asia. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) revealed that 61 per cent of new displacements in 2017 had been triggered by natural disasters, surpassing warfare and political conflict, which contributed to only 39 per cent of mass migration.<br/> According to the IDMC, in 2017 alone more than 18.8 million people across the world were forced to migrate due to natural disasters, while weather-related hazards contributed to a majority of the migration from disaster \u2013 8.6 million people globally were displaced by floods and 7.5 million people were displaced by storms.<br/> Out of the overall disaster-related displacements, China had the highest proportion of new victims, at 4.4 million people.

Likewise, the role of trees in addressing the climate change problem has received much attention in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) special report on \u201cClimate Change and Land\u201d. However, planting trees is not a silver bullet against climate change and it should be a part of an inclusive action plan to address the climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Planting trees is no substitute for natural forests. A recent study published in \u201cFrontiers in Forests and Global Change\u201d shows that growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential\u2014termed \u201cProforestation\u201d\u2014is a more effective, immediate, and low-cost approach for removing and storing GHGs in the long-term. Proforestation signifies protecting and stewarding intact forests/ecosystems\u2014largely free from human interventions except primarily for trails and hazard removals\u2014and restoring natural forests. This approach could be implemented across suitable forests of all types.</p><p>Proforestation serves a crucial service by maximising co-benefits such as nature-based biological carbon sequestration\u2014the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plants to then be stored in vegetation and soils\u2014and unparalleled services to the ecosystem. It also provides long-term benefits for biodiversity, climate resilience, and human benefits. Proforestation has the potential to provide additional carbon sequestration to reduce net emissions in the US by much more than the 11 percent that forests provide currently, according to research.</p><p>Afforestation and reforestation face significant challenges. Afforestation requires an enormous amount of additional land, which would be a considerable barrier to feed nine billion people by 2050. Besides, neither strategy can remove sufficient carbon by growing young trees during the critical next decade(s), a study indicates.</p><p>\u201cNatural climate solutions\u201d\u2014conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions\u2014have the potential to increase carbon storage and avoid GHGs. However, existing proposals for natural climate solutions do not consider explicitly the potential of proforestation.</p><p>A more recent paper in the journal Science, entitled \u201cThe global tree restoration potential\u201d, explains that the restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. \u201cA trillion trees could be planted\u201d to address the changing climate problem, the paper estimates.</p><p>The \u201cClimate Change and Land\u201d report summarised that while some response options have immediate impact such as the conservation of high-carbon ecosystems: peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests; other options, such as afforestation and reforestation as well as the reclamation of degraded soils, take decades to deliver measurable results. These examples indicate that restoring and protecting the existing ecosystems are more effective than tree plantations, in terms of getting adaptation and mitigation benefits within a short time.</p><p>The concept of \u201cnature-based solutions\u201d can be misinterpreted by prioritising and investing in more tree plantations (either through afforestation and reforestation), which is one of the popular initiatives for addressing climate change, taken by the government. According to Science, the primary climate solution is the \u201cprotection\u201d, \u201cstewardship\u201d and \u201crestoration\u201d of carbon-rich intact ecosystems/natural forests.</p><p>Natural forests (including soils) store more carbon than is found in the atmosphere. Their loss and degradation would trigger emissions that would cause global warming to exceed 2 degree C, crossing the 1.5 degree C threshold. Mature forests can adapt to changing conditions and store more carbon than young, degraded or plantation forests.</p><p>The latest IPCC report sheds light on the Sundarban\u2019s present condition. The report mentions that, \u201clarge areas of the Sundarban mangroves have been converted into paddy fields over the past two centuries and more recently into shrimp farms.\u201d They warn coastal land erosion could be expedited as a result of the destruction of mangrove forests and wetlands.</p><p>Deforestation is the conversion of forest to non-forest land and can result in land degradation. In some areas, emissions from degradation can exceed those of deforestation, studies indicate. Once damaged, natural ecosystems are more exposed to further impacts from climatic and non-climatic stressors.</p><p>Avoiding further loss and degradation of natural forests and intact ecosystems, and allowing degraded forests to regrow naturally, would reduce global carbon emissions annually by about one gigaton (Gt), and reduce another two to four Gts of carbon emissions through just allowing natural regrowth, one study estimates.</p><p>A study published in the Nature journal estimates that increasing canopy cover through natural regeneration of degraded forests could have superior climate benefits over the course of the century than establishing new plantations.</p><p>Restoring natural forests have, therefore, received huge attention from scientists and policymakers. The German government and the IUCN launched the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 Mha of forest by 2030.</p><p>Under this challenge and other national schemes, 43 countries in the tropics and subtropics have pledged to restore forests to sequester carbon. For instance, Vietnam is allowing 14.6 Mha to return to natural forest, which is the world\u2019s most substantial commitment of this nature.</p><p>Proforestation provides the most effective solution to the dual global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. It does not require additional land beyond what is already forested and provides new forest related opportunities along with quantifiable ecosystem services. However, effective actions are indispensable to make the most of it.</p><p>Politicians have to recognise that proforestation is a better means of GHGs removal than other options. Our government must identify suitable (public) forest lands for protection and reservation for proforestation. Our government must also realise that implementing (and reorienting) existing forest regulations are a sine qua non of growing intact forest ecosystems. Proforestation requires explicit support of the (updated) \u201cBangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan.\u201d It is a practical, economical, and effective mechanism of GHGs removal. Without revamping forest governance, however, it will be hard to implement it.</p><p>(Ranjan Roy, Ph.D, is an Associate Professor at the Department of Agricultural Extension and Information System, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Daily Star (Bangladesh)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["This approach could be implemented across suitable forests of all types.
